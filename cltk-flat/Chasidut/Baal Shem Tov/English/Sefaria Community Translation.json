        "2_Bereshit, 0_Comment, 1_Paragraph": "2. Breishet. I received from the Rav Hamochiach (preacher or reprove) who said in the name of the Baal Shem Tov, that when the Messiah comes, speedily in our days, the whole Torah will be explained (or interpreted) from the beginning to the end, on all the combinations in each and every word. And after this, he will make from the whole Torah one word, and he will elevate combinations without number, and he will expound upon all the combinations. (Teshuot Chen, Parshah Tazria). ",
        "2_Bereshit, 1_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "1. \"In the beginning G-d created\", etc. To resolve the problem that was difficult for all the Rishonim, may their memories be for a blessing, why did the Holy One not create the world before this time? In that this action/deed is immediate good from absence. And why did His Will, may He be blessed, change, will to will in the moment of creation and not before this, behold He, blessed is His Name, is not a Master of Change? Of this it is written (Malachi 3:6) \"I Hashem do not (or have not) change\".",
        "2_Bereshit, 1_Comment, 1_Paragraph": "2. And the solution of this [problem is] that He does not resemble the acts of flesh and blood. The wisdom that he has now he did not have from before. And his wisdom he acquired (or possessed), and he is (at) a disadvantage. For instance, because of what he needs prior to living in it, therefore he acquires wisdom to build himself a house, then he builds himself the house. But He, praise His Name, His Wisdom is intrinsic and not acquired and He is not at a disadvantage. And therefore this is the Will that rose in His Will to create the world, not that he renewed for Himself this Will at the time of the creation of the world. Rather, like He is ancient, so his His Will is ancient. And this (early desire) was His immediate Will to create the World in this moment when He created it and not before. And therefore in the moment the world was created it was created truly in that moment and in that time, just like it was in His Will before to create it. Specifically in this moment, and if so reasonably He had no change in His Will whatsoever.",
        "2_Bereshit, 1_Comment, 2_Paragraph": "The proof of this is the world as it will be in the time to come, \"the world that is entirely Shabbat, [where] the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads\" (Berachot 17:a), and none but God will be exalted on that day (Isaiah 2:11). Certainly that world is at a higher [spiritual] level than the world is now, and such an event/reality certainly is better than its absence. So why did the Holy One Blessed Be He not begin with this, [but rather arrange it so that] all this must come at its own era and time - just as Shabbat comes only after the six profane days?  In regard to the creation of the world, even though the Holy One Blessed be He knew that its existence was better than its absence, nonetheless, He placed His Will in opposition to His [fore]knowledge and so made this [present world] come first.  Though he knew that this act [creating the world in an ideal state] was good, still He desired to not bring this about until its appointed time. So He ignored His knowledge and followed His will.  That which preceded creation can be likened to the world that is entirely Shabbat, and this is as the verse says (Kohelet 3:11) He brings everything to pass precisely at its time, even the world [this is reading against the p'shat of the Kohelet verse].  This is a very deep secret that one who understands [Kabbalah] will comprehend. ",

Nega'im 2:5) and the holy Ba'al Shem Tov explained that \"a person sees all defects outside (chutz)\" - what they see is a continuation of that person's defects, as our sages say \"he disqualifies others with his own flaw.\"",

        "3_Noach, 14_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "\"Make an opening [<i>tzohar</i>] for the ark [<i>teivah</i>], closing up to a cubit at the top.\" (Genesis 6:16) -- The Baal Shem Tov, peace be upon him, explained these words in the following way: let the word (<i>teivah</i>) said in Torah or in prayer radiate light  (<i>matzhir</i>)! For in every letter there are worlds, souls and divinity, that rise up and interconnect and cleave to one another and to the divine. Afterwards, these letters connect and conjoin, finally becoming a word. After that, they connect and unify unifications of  truth in the Divine - and one must unify one's soul with each of the aforementioned aspects. In this way, all the worlds rise and become as one, and then there is immense joy and immeasurable delight. This is the meaning of \"...bottom, second, and third decks,\" (Genesis 6:16) - that is the worlds, souls and divinities, as it says (Zohar I:159a) \"there are three worlds, etc.\" In each and every word one must listen to what is being spoken, since the Shechina is the world of speech, as it is says (Zohar III:230a) \"She speaks and He is Her escort.\" \"<i>Tzohar</i>\" - this 'opening' for light - that everything should be illuminated with clarity, giving pleasure to the Creator. One needs great faith (<i>Emunah</i>) for this, since the Shechinah Herself is called <i>Emunat Amen</i>, faithful faith (Zohar II:16b). Without faith, Heaven forbid, She is called (Proverbs 16:28) \"A querulous one who alienates their friend.\" As for the end of the verse, \"closing up to a cubit (<i>amah</i>)\" -- this is the Mother (<i>Ima</i>). It could be said that after the word leaves one's mouth, it does not need to be remembered again, one does not see that it rises to an elevated place, just as one can not look at the sun, as it says, \"closing up at the top.\" How does one do all this? \"Go into the ark [<i>teivah</i>], you and all your household.\" (Genesis 7:1) -- this means that with all your body and strengths, you shall enter the word [<i>teivah</i>]!",
        "3_Noach, 15_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "In prayer, one needs to exert all one's energy in the speech, moving from one letter to the other until one completely forgets corporeality. One should see the letters joining and combining with each other, and this is great joy! If it is joyful in the material world, how much more so in the realm of the spirit - the world of <i>yetzirah</i> , formation. Once the thought is directed towards the letters, one does not even hear what one is saying - this is arriving at the world of <i>beriah</i>, creation. Afterwards, one arrives to the aspect of <b>Nothingness</b>, when all one's bodily forces are annulled, and this is the world of <i>atzilut</i>, emanation, and the sefirah of <i>chochmah</i>, wisdom.

He said that <i>teivah</i> actually means 'word', and the meaning of making an opening for the word is that one should be careful to bring light into the words that come from your lips. The verse continues: \"Make bottom and second and third floors.\" This seems to be what my father related to me, saying that in every word are worlds, souls, and divinities. This is what is meant by <i>teivah</i>, speech, which also has at its most basic level worlds. The second level is also known as <i>mishneh</i>, secondary, which has the same letters as <i>neshamah</i>, soul - this is the level of souls. And the third level (<i>shelishim</i>) is divinities, which is hinted at in the verse (Exodus 14:7), \"Officers (<i>shalishim</i>) [ruling] over all of them,\" like the Divine who rules over all things. All of these levels you should \"Make\" - the speech and the word coming out of your mouth should have this intention and be in complete faithfulness, knowing that in each act of speech there are bottom and second and third levels, the worlds, souls and divinities --- Understand this!",

The verse continues, \"closing up to a cubit above\" -- meaning, one draws sustenance to the Shechinah from above.",
        "3_Noach, 18_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "I heard in the name of the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, that he explained the verse (Genesis 16:6) \"Make an opening for the ark (<i>teivah</i>)\" - one should turn the words (<i>teivah</i>) of Torah and of prayer into an illuminated opening, to look and see from the beginning of the world until its end.",
        "3_Noach, 19_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "The Baal Shem Tov, may his memory guard us, would explain the verse (Genesis 6:16) \"Make an opening (<i>tzohar</i>) for the ark (<i>teivah</i>).\"  <i>Tzohar</i> actually means light, and  <i>teivah</i> actually means speech. This means that when a Jew wants to speak, they must make sure that one's thought illuminates the words first, because thought (<i>machshavah</i>) is the same letters and connected to <i>chashav mah</i>, 'think of the object'.",
        "3_Noach, 20_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "My father of blessed memory explained the secret of the verse (Genesis 6:16) \"lower and second and third decks\" - that one should make ones petitions from the letters, from the mystery of the divine light that dwells within them, and make the petition come from there, etc.",
        "3_Noach, 21_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "One should certainly make their petitions from the letters themselves, as I heard from my father of blessed memory. He explained that these petitions can come from the divine mystery within them, to ask that for help, that one may express these letters with true intention, for their own sake.

For each letter is an entire world, and when one says the word with great communion, certainly those supernal worlds are aroused, and one makes great actions thereby. Therefore, one should be careful to pray with passion and with great communion, and this will certainly cause reaction in the supernal worlds, since every letter causes arousal above.",
        "3_Noach, 26_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "So too, if one's prayer be pure and clear, one's sacred breath coming out of their mouth in prayer will join and connect with the supernal breath that constantly comes into one. As our Holy Sages said on the verse (Psalms 150:6) \"Every living soul (<i>neshamah</i>) will praise God,\" - this means that with each and every breath (<i>neshimah</i>) that one breathes out, from below to above and returns from above to below - certainly through this some piece of divinity from the person is now connected to its root.",
        "3_Noach, 27_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "The Rabbi's soul told him that the reason that he merited that supernal things were revealed to him was not because he had studied much Talmud and halachic codes, but because he had always prayed with great intention, <i>kavannah gedolah</i>, and for this he merited to attain such a level.",
        "3_Noach, 28_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "The Baal Shem Tov revealed that even though one prays with great cleaving and with the proper levels of love and fear - even so, one must be sure to also have the proper submission to the Holy One. One time he and his disciples were praying with great cleaving, but without submission, and there was great opposition above, and only one of them who had submitted and was thereby saved.",
        "3_Noach, 29_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "The Baal Shem Tov said that one who reads from the Torah and sees the light of the letters in the Torah -- if even they didn't understand the cantillation correctly, since they had read with great love and passion, the Holy One is not exacting with the reader, even though the words weren't read correctly. This can be compared to a young child beloved by her father. When she asks for something from her father, even if she stutters and makes mistakes, the father has great joy. Therefore, when one says words of Torah with love, the Holy One has much love towards them and isn't exacting as to whether they spoke correctly, as our rabbis of blessed memory taught (Song of Songs 2:4) \"His banner (<i>diglo</i>) of love is over me.\" - don't read this word as <i>diglo</i>, but as <i>ligluglo</i>, His mockery of love is over me. ",
        "3_Noach, 30_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "One needs to guard one's mouth and tongue with regard to all speech. Even in terms of permitted speech our blessed sages were strict, as they said (Berachot 14a) that one should not even say hello to a person, since even this is destructive before the morning prayer. It is known that the world was created through thought, speech and action. Thought is the most primary, and speech is a branch of thought, and action is a branch of speech. So too, when a person wakes up from their sleep and becomes a new creature, as it is written (Eichah 3:23) \"Renewed every morning\" - if one begins by speaking permitted speech, and all the more so that which is not permitted! - even if one continues by praying and studies Torah, everything branches out from this first speech-act. Just as speech is a branch of thought and inferior to it, so too is the second speech-act to the first, as it says in the Zohar 2:83a and in the writings of Isaac Luria on respecting one's older brother, since the eldest brother takes the principal share and the other siblings are continuations from him. So too here, and therefore one should be careful to sanctify one's first speech-act, purifying one's first thought that it cleave to holiness so that it draws towards it all subsequent acts of speech. Afterwards, standing in prayer with the joy of performing a commandment, just as one's speech and thought were sanctified in this way, one's prayer will surely be answered. ",
        "3_Noach, 31_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "Everything one sees should be a reminder of the Holy Blessed One! If it is love, one should recall the love of God. If it is fear, one should recall fear of God. We know this from several sources. And even when one goes to the toilet, one should think: behold, I am separating bad from good, and the good will remain to worship Him, may He be blessed! All such thoughts are divine unifications.",
        "3_Noach, 32_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "\"Justice goes before Him, as He sets out on His way.\" (Psalms 85:14) -- There is a moral teaching here. There are some people who, on their way to fulfil the <i>mitzvah</i> of prayer or some such thing, stop to speak to other people. Even though they afterwards go on to the <i>mitzvah</i>, they have transgressed in not having run with passion, and their punishment after their death will be similar in nature. We know from several books that [after death] one passes over a river on a very narrow bridge, and this is considered as difficult suffering, for one has fear and trembling and needs to run very fast. This is the only way, on a very narrow bridge, to run fast. And then in the middle of the bridge, the Holy One sends an interrupting angel! And this is the very same angel that was created from that <i>mitzvah</i> that was interrupted and caused pain to this angel. From the thought that one had at home, intending to perform the <i>mitzvah</i>, a soul was created for the angel, and in actually performing the <i>mitzvah</i>, a body was created. But since one delayed the creation of that body, tarrying along the way and speaking to people, this angel comes to delay one, and not allow one to run, and this will be very frightening. This is the meaning of \"Justice goes before Him,\" -- the simple meaning is that all one's <i>mitzvot</i> walk before one after death. But when one is careful to go quickly and passionately when going to perform a <i>mitzvah</i> or to the synagogue, and not with laziness, \"He sets out on His way\" and doesn't interrupt the person crossing the river.",
        "3_Noach, 33_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "\"Kindness is yours, God, and You will pay each man according to his deeds.\" (Psalms 62:13) The difficulty on this verse is well-known. Yet it seems to apply to the story told by the holy Baal Shem Tov, that once there was a strong indictment against the Jews on Yom Kippur. Satan said that he was not talking at all about the wicked people, but rather about good and God-fearing people. Such people who would come to pray in the synagogue every day, but on their way to pray would see a carriage carrying firewood, and would start haggling over the price and get a small discount, on account of which they would come to the synagogue late, after <i>barechu</i> and <i>kedusha</i>. All the defending angels above have nothing to say in defence of this. But the Baal Shem Tov had something to say. He said: it is true that before performing the <i>mitzvah</i>, they were willing to give it up for a small sum. But after performing the <i>mitzvah</i>, even if they would have been offered a large sum of money, nobody would give it up, not even the simple-minded. And on account of this defence, the harsh decrees were sweetened. This is the meaning of the verse \"Kindness is yours, God, and You will pay each man according to his deeds\" - that is, according to the <i>mitzvah</i> after it was done, not before it was done. ",
        "3_Noach, 34_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "I heard from my teacher of blessed memory that it happens that some need to strengthen themselves before prayer, in order to have the mental channels (<i>mochin</i>) open to pray without any foreign thoughts at all, or to pray with cleaving. This is done by singing or by studying Torah before standing to pray, and this opens up the mental channels. There are some, however, who when they begin with many songs and Torah study have no mental channels open for prayer. This is the meaning of the Talmudic teaching (Menachot 110a): \"One who brings much or one who brings little [are equal], as long as their heart is directed towards heaven\" - as long as one has these mental channels, <i>mochin</i>, they are equal. We have thus solved the difficulty brought up by the Taz (on Orach Chayim 1:4) - and the words of the wise are pleasant. ",
        "3_Noach, 35_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "One should not recite many psalms before prayer, in order not to tire the body and not be able afterwards to say the main parts of the prayer, the obligation of the day, with great cleaving: namely, the [obligatory] psalms, the Shema, and the standing prayer. One loses their strength on other things before getting to these parts of the prayer. At first, one should only say the main parts of the prayer with great cleaving, and if God gives them additional strength then they should also say other psalms and the Song of Songs with great cleaving. The same applies on Yom Kippur before Neilah, one should say the fixed order of prayer minimally, in order to be able to pray with great cleaving.",
        "3_Noach, 36_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "Our sages taught (Pesachim 117a) that whenever a psalm begins with \"A song to David (<i>mizmor leDavid</i>)\", that indicates that he would first play music and only then would the <i>Shechinah</i> descend on him. The song would bring the holy spirit to David. And whenever the psalm begins \"To David, a song (<i>leDavid mizmor</i>)\", first the <i>Shechinah</i> would descend upon him with the holy spirit, and afterwards he would recite poetry. But when we recite the Book of Psalms ourselves, we should be humble and embarrassed, for when does the holy spirit enter us, whether before or after? As such, we should be careful to say the psalms in holiness and in purity, in awe and wonder.",
        "3_Noach, 37_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "It was taught in the name of the Baal Shem Tov, that he used to instruct his disciples to study a teaching of Zohar before every time they prayed.",
        "3_Noach, 38_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "One should take care to pray, whether in summer or in winter, before the rising of the sun. That is, the majority of the prayer, almost up to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, before the sun rises. For the distance between before and after sunrise is as the distance between East and West, since before it rises one can still easily nullify the forces of harshness. This can be seen in the verse (Psalms 19:6) \"And he (the sun) is like a groom going forth from his canopy, eager as a hero, etc... and nothing is hidden from his heat (<i>michamato</i>).\" Don't read this word as <i>michamato</i>, but rather <i>micheimato</i>, \"from his anger!\" This means that once the sun has gone out over the land, then nothing is hidden from the forces of harshness that derive from the fiery angels of the sun. This matter, therefore, should not be seen as insignificant in your eyes, for it is a great matter. The Baal Shem Tov, may his memory be a blessing, would be very particular about this, and occasionally he would rather pray at this time alone, if a <i>minyan</i> could not be gathered.",
        "3_Noach, 39_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "In the name of our master, the Baal Shem Tov - may his soul rest in the chambers up high - the reason for it being forbidden to start one's Amida prayer before the rest of the community begins (as mentioned in the Talmud, Berachot 28b, and in the Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 90:10) is because it is prior to the will and the consent of the limbs.",
        "3_Noach, 40_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "One should sense oneself, before prayer, that one is ready to die in the upcoming prayer, from the intensity of the feeling of <i>kavvannah</i>, attunement. There are those who are so strongly attuned that occasionally they could physically die, in two or three words that they present before the Blessed One. When one reflects upon this, one should say in one's heart: what request or pride should I have in this prayer, since I am prepared to die after two or three words. In truth, it is out of great kindness from the Blessed One that one is given the strength to complete their prayer and remain alive.",
        "3_Noach, 41_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "It is from the enormous kindness of the Blessed One that anyone remains alive after prayer, since in the way of nature one ought to have died after expending all their strength, having put all their strength in prayer, from the intensity of their attunement.

For man's conception is an entire body (<i>shiur koma</i>), and the proof of this is that when one thinks of someone else during sexual intercourse, one gives birth to a 'child of substitution' (cf. Nedarim 20b), while when one imagines nothing at all, one can not engage in intercourse. Thought is of the divine aspect of <i>Chochma</i>, Wisdom, and speech is born from it. Even in thought there are letters, for one's thoughts are structured by letters, and when doesn't think while speaking he is like one who spills his seed, since speech is his vitality.",

But if one sees that they are in the mystery of smallness and cannot find attunement, when distracting thoughts overpower them - in this case, one should pray like a day-old child from the written text. This was attested to by my teacher, when he was in a foreign land for some time in such a state, and everything escaped him - he would cleave himself to the letters. He said that when one prays from the written text and cleaves to the letters themselves, they rise to the level of Action. (For the word '<i>ktav</i>', 'writing,' is an abbreviation of <i>Keter</i> of <i>Malchut</i>, which is the letter <i>tav</i>, through <i>Binah</i>.)

Rather, one should start slowly, and in the middle cleave with intense cleaving, so that one can utter all the words of the prayer quickly. Even if at the beginning of the prayer, one is unable to pray with intense cleaving, one should still say the words in utter attunement. Slowly, one builds up the strength until God helps them be able to cleave intensely in prayer.",

At first, one should cleave the the body of the word. Next, one should give a soul to the word! One should also physically arouse oneself at the beginning with all one's strength, so that the soul is illuminated. This was explained in the Zohar (Zohar 3:168a) \"If wood doesn't kindle, it should be struck until it lights.\" Afterwards, one can worship in thought only, without movements of the body. ",

        "3_Noach, 52_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "Even when one falls from their spiritual level, one should cleave to the Creator in smallness of thought. For even above there is smallness too, in <i>Ze'ir Anpin</i>, the 'small face' of the Divine. And from this smallness one can come to greatness, like with coals: if there even one spark that remains, one can blow on it strongly until it becomes a huge fire. This is not the case when there is not even one small spark, there no fire can be raised. So too, if one is not constantly cleaving with a small thought to the Blessed One, their soul might be extinguished - God forbid!",

Rather, one should find even more strength, and let more and more fear fall upon them. This is similar to a king going out to battle and disguising himself: the wise recognise him from his movements; and those who are not so wise recognise him from his effect, since wherever there is heavy security, that is where the king is. So too, when one cannot pray with attunement, they should know that there are guards around the king - truly, the King is there, but one cannot draw close on account of the guards around him. Therefore, one must find strength and awe, and with great might and focus, in order to draw close and pray before the Blessed One - only then can one pray with intense attunement.",

This is similar to a king who goes out to battle and disguises himself. Those close to the royal court recognise the king from his movements; those far from royal life only see that the people come close together in a certain place, and infer that surely the king is there. So too, when one cannot pray, the King is being guarded in order not to be revealed. Therefore one should find more strength, since the King is nearby, and being hidden from one's view.",

        "3_Noach, 57_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "When one first desires to pray, it should come from a sense of awe, which is the gate to reach the Holy One (Shabbat 31b). One should say in their heart: \"To whom do I wish to cleave? To the Creator, to the One who spoke all worlds into being, who grants them existence and sustains them!\" One should ponder God's greatness and power, and in this can enter the higher worlds. ",
        "3_Noach, 58_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "There are some who pray in melancholy, from an excess of black bile, and think that they are praying with great awe. So too, there are some who think that they are praying out of great love for the Creator, on account of their blood, the red humour. When, however, one is in a state of loving God, and as a result shame falls upon them, and they want to glorify the Blessed One and defeat the evil urge on God's account - this is very good. One is not considered a worshipper of God without the qualities of awe and love. One should allow awe to fall on them, and not arouse themselves to awe, which would be drawing up the <i>mayim nukvin</i>, the feminine waters. Real awe is when fear and terror fall upon you, and out of fear you have no idea where you are, and the mind clears and tears fall on their own. When it is not like this, even though it may seem that one loves the Creator, it is surely not so for \"This is the gate to God\" (Psalms 118:20): awe is the gate that leads to love, and if one does not go through the gate of awe, how can one be in a state of love? Such a person is not even a servant, much less a person on the level of having awe fall on them - they are not worshipping in a way that befits a Jew at all, only serving God out of automatic reflexes (Isaiah 29:13) and fooling themselves that they are actually serving God and worshipping God with joy. This is nothing but flippant joy, and one should return to God with their entire heart and soul. ",
        "3_Noach, 59_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "Prayer in the midst of great joy is certainly more accepted before the Blessed One than the prayer of sadness and tears. This is similar to a poor person who begs and pleads before the king, crying profusely: nonetheless, the king only gives them a small amount. But when the minister joyfully praises the king, and presents a request alongside it, the king generously gives a much greater amount.",
        "3_Noach, 60_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "\"We will make wreaths of gold with spangles of silver\" (Song of Songs 1:11). 'Wreaths of gold' - this is awe; 'Spangles of silver' - this is love. One should not, therefore, speak Torah and prayer to the outside, since from this the <i>kelipot</i>, the hard outer shells are created and take the form of evil people who take revenge on us. I heard such things from my teacher, the Baal Shem Tov. This is what the sages meant (Rashi on Genesis 6:18) in saying that Noah needed protection not to be killed by the wicked of his generation. Try to understand this! One needs awe more than one needs love, the 'spangles of silver'. All this I heard from my teacher. ",

Such a person is not a faithful servant. But since it becomes evident that being without the king is bad for you, you must push past all the guards until you come before the king - even if you don't know how to speak in his presence, and are not fit to stand before him. Be that as it may, the King will respond to your desires, for he is flowing with great mercy. ",
        "3_Noach, 63_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "\"All the days of poverty are wretched\" (Proverbs 15:15) -- In light of what our Sages of blessed memory taught (Nedarim 41a), \"Poverty means nothing but a lack of wisdom\", this verse means the following: \"All the days of poverty\" - this is lack of wisdom - \"are wretched\" - meaning, your prayer and your learning are nothing to the Blessed One, because they are lacking in awe and in love, and they do not fly upwards (cf. Tikkunei Hazohar 10). On this verse, the Talmud (Bava Batra 146a) questions - but what about Shabbat and festivals? Surely on these days every person is aroused from above, and prays in a state of attunement. The answer is given that there is a change of habit, which causes wretchedness: you see yourself praying with attunement and are filled with pride and grandeur. Seeing yourself rise to this high level, even so, there is wretchedness since \"a change of habit leads to sickness of the bowels\" - the evil urge only acts during eating and drinking (Zohar 1:110a), and in this sense, you are filled with pride. This is evident to those who can understand. ",
        "3_Noach, 64_Comment, 0_Paragraph": "I heard this in the name of the Baal Shem Tov of blessed memory, who would say: A grave transgression is committed by the praying community, when the leader of prayer doesn't lengthen the singing and wants to end a part of the prayer, but the community continues with a lengthy prayer. By doing so, they prevent the leader of prayer from channelling the Divine Flow. If he needs to wait until the public finishes their prayer, this way or that his heightened consciousness will be weakened, and he won't have the correct consciousness to channel the Flow from the Divine Presence. If so, how careful must the community be in order to make sure that they do not cause such a thing, God forbid, and lose such great goodness. On account of this, the Baal Shem Tov truly saw what a weighty task both sides, the leader and the community, take upon themselves in knowing how to act during prayer - especially the leader. ",

It is as if the mitzvah grew old, as in the phrase (cited in Tur, Orach Chaim 61) \"like an old letter.\" It was in this regard that he said: Don't cast me away from passion!

Sometimes, you can pray with love, awe and passion without a single movement, and it will seem to someone else that they are being said without any intense cleaving. This can only be done with the utmost cleaving to the Holy One; only then can God be worshipped in the soul alone with great love. Such worship is better and goes faster and with stronger cleaving to the Holy One than prayer that can be seen outwardly in the limbs.

Therefore, you are speaking together with all of them, and raise up all creatures, in heaven and on earth, by praying so. The enlightened ones who pray in such attunement are even able to awaken the letters of the simple people, and then they are also able to pray with greater attunement and passion, and return to being their best selves.

When you do this, then your God is with you, and you should rise up together with them, to have them cleave to the Blessed One.

And I heard that for this reason there is a person who loves a certain thing, and there is a person who hates that thing and loves another thing; and when he uses that tool, or eats foods even for his body’s needs, he fixes the sparks. For afterward he serves [God], with that same power that comes to his body from that food or clothing or other things, with that power he serves Blessed God, and we find that through this [the sparks] are fixed. Therefore sometimes it happens that when he has already finished fixing all the sparks that were in that thing, which were related to the root of his soul, then Blessed God takes that tool from him and gives it to someone else, since the sparks that [remain] in that tool are relevant to a different root.",
