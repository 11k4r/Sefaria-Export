        "0_Introduction, 1_Paragraph": "King Solomon said in Proverbs (22, 6): \"Teach the lad according to his way, so that also in his old age he will not turn from it.\" This is the core of education: that not only at the time the child is young and in the domain of his father that he will listen and do according to the commandments, rather also when he grows up and is in his own domain, even when he becomes elderly he will not turn from it. Because education is not only commands, that one should command his son or student \"Do such and such,\" so too is it not just habit, that one accustoms his son or student to good deeds. Education is far, far beyond commands or habit, and these two things, commands and habit, are simply tools used in its implementation which the educator is forced to use, to command or to habituate, in order to educate on the path of the LORD.",
        "0_Introduction, 2_Paragraph": "As Rashi, may his memory be blessed, explains the word <i>chinukh</i> (education), in the verse (Deuteronomy 20:5), \"who built a house but did not dedicate it (<i>chankho</i>) - \"<i>Chinukh</i> is a term for beginning.\" But it is obvious that we would not say, <i>chinukh</i>, about any beginning. For example, when the Gemara (Pesachim 116a) says about the order of the Haggadah, \"One begins with disgrace and ends with praise,\" we would not say, \"One is <i>mechanekh</i> with disgrace, etc.\" And likewise regarding the Sanhedrin (Sanhedrin 32a) - that we begin from the side - we would not say that, we are <i>mechankhin</i> from the side. However in Parashat Lech Lecha (Rashi on Genesis 14:14), Rashi explains it further to us, as follows: \"<i>Chanikhiv</i>,\" etc. whom he had trained in the commandments. It is a term for introducing a person or a thing, for the first time, to some particular occupation in which it is intended that he should remain. It has a similar sense in (Proverbs 22:6), \"<i>Chanokh</i> the lad,\" in (Numbers 7:84) \"the dedication (<i>chanukat</i>) of the altar\" and in (Psalms 30:1) \"The dedication (<i>chanukat</i>) of the house.\" ",
        "0_Introduction, 3_Paragraph": "However the term, <i>chinukh</i>, would not be said even about a craftsman that begins his work, if he is already able to do it. Likewise would the term, <i>chinukh</i> of the house, not apply to a house when we begin to build it. Rather, the term, <i>chinukh</i> only applies to the one who is coming to teach himself the craft, or to the [new] use of a house that has already been built. And this is a precise inference from the words of Rashi, \"for the first time, etc. in which it is intended that he should remain.\" It is not about the craft or work, but only about the person. The term, <i>chinukh</i>, applies to the readying for a craft which is within the inner potential of a person to do; or the readying of a house or a vessel for a particular purpose. The word, <i>chinukh</i>, is specific (it is not the same as beginning). It is said about bringing out the readiness that is in a person or a thing from the potential to the actual. If we do not bring it out, it will stay hidden. So we need to bring out and ready (<i>lechanekh</i>) a particular man to do a particular craft, or a house or a vessel for its use - every room for the use for which it is meant; and [every] vessel for the use for which it is meant.",
        "0_Introduction, 4_Paragraph": "And when this word is used about educating children, the intention is to expand and develop the nature and talent of the child found in small measure, in potential or even in hiding - and to reveal it. And since the spirit of God and a Godly soul is buried and stored in a Jew even when he is a child, we must raise him and educate him to bring it out, to reveal it and to have it flourish - so that he will be a faithful Jew to God. [Then] he will desire His Torah on his own, so that also in his old age he will not veer from His path. But one who commands or habituates the son or student cannot be sure that [the child] will do according to his command even when he grows up and becomes independent. And that is why Solomon commanded, \"Teach (<i>Chanokh</i>) the lad, etc.\" - you must delve inside him and reveal the Jewish holiness that is hidden there. And only then, \"also in his old age he will not veer from it.\"",
        "0_Introduction, 5_Paragraph": "But King Solomon did not only inform us of the goal of education, which is to is to bring him to, \"also in his old age he will not veer from it.\" Rather he also explained to us the manner and method of how to reach this, with the words, \"Teach (<i>Chanokh</i>) the lad according to his way.\" For this is the essence of it. Since one who only commands and habituates does not need to pay attention to the son or student, to know his nature or intellect, etc. He only has to command, \"Do this and that,\" and that is enough. He will also not feel his own need to treat each and every student differently. He is able to command many students of the same age with one command - \"Do this and that.\" For this thing is not dependent on the student or child, but rather only on him. He will command and that will be the end of it. But an educator who wants to reveal the buried and stored away soul of the student, to uplift it and set it on fire with a divine fire that reaches the Highest Holy One, such that all of him - even the powers of his body - grows in holiness and pines for God's Torah, is required to soften himself towards the student that he is educating. He must delve into his juvenility and smallness until he reaches the spark of his stored away - or even hidden - soul, bring it out, develop it and grow it. ",
        "0_Introduction, 6_Paragraph": "And since this is so, education is not the same for all children. It depends upon the nature, intelligence, character traits, etc. of each and every child. These must be recognized by the educator, and it is not enough for the educator to simply know himself and his own intelligence. For the matter is dependent upon the one being educated. He may not only use his own strengths to act command and instruct; but must also grab onto, use and bring to bear the intelligence and strengths of the student. So he may not command and educate the one what he commands and educates the other; as he is different from the first in his nature, willpower, character traits, etc. And this is what King Solomon hinted to us [when he said], \"Teach (<i>Chanokh</i>) the lad according to his way\" - each and every one, according to his way. ",
        "0_Introduction, 7_Paragraph": "Our intention here is not to instruct about the pedagogical tools of education - how to work with a student's intellect, and the methods through which one can broaden his understanding in order to know the simple meaning of the Torah. For we are not just seeking the intellect of the student here, but rather the whole student. We seek the spirit, essence and soul (<i>nefesh, ruach veneshamah</i>) of the Jewish child, in order to connect him to the God of Israel, such that he will be a God-fearing Jew, whose every desire is towards Him, may He be blessed. ",
        "0_Introduction, 8_Paragraph": "Behold that even though every father and teacher knows that the small children or students before them will not remain small but rather grow into adults - possibly even great Torah scholars and servants of God - nevertheless, some only see their goals based on what is before their eyes. And since they only see children, their only goal is to educate them to be good children; they only want to inculcate Torah and fear of Heaven according to their age - and they think that is enough. However such a teacher or father is sinning against God and His people. A teacher or father must know that they must educate and reveal the children of God and the great men of Israel. They must see the children sitting in front of them as great souls that have not yet been chiseled; and that it is incumbent upon them to raise them and make them flourish. He is a gardener in God's garden who must work it and guard it. And even if he sees children who appear to him to be bitter and have bad character traits, he should know that this is the nature of young souls that are not yet ripe - they are bitter when they just blossom but [sweet] when they mature.",
        "0_Introduction, 9_Paragraph": "The Baal Shem Tov and his students after him - holy Jews - taught us that there is no completely evil trait or nature in a Jewish child. However we must know how to make use of them and refine them. For example, if one has a stubborn student - which is a bad character trait, from which the teacher may suffer greatly - he must reflect that when [this student] grows up and accepts the yoke of Torah and service to God, his service will be tenacious and marked by self-sacrifice. He will not be flighty and unstable, but will rather be the type of Jewish man we find in the Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 39:3), \"If he erects his words like a wall\" - see there - he will be strong like a fortress wall regarding everything having to do with divine service. And if he sees a student with the trait of anger - though it is true that the way the student now uses his anger is very bad - is that enough of a reason to decide that his root is wormwood and gall and that he is bad and lowly by nature? Would we not be playing the fool who hears the praise of the citron and then plucks it to eat the seed or to eat it when it is unripe and then yells out and makes a fuss, saying, \"The citron is bitter and harmful?\"",
        "0_Introduction, 10_Paragraph": "Are the principal and teacher able to imagine the great benefit they can bring out from the bad temper of the angry child when they delve inside him and draw him near, so that his heart and soul burn with self-sacrifice for God? His anger will turn into holy fire - every act of service will burn like glowing coals; all of his words spoken for God, in Torah [study] and prayer, will be with a voice that thunders and draws out fiery flames. And see the explanation of the Rabbi (R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi), may his memory be blessed, in his Siddur on the prayer, <i>Kegavna</i> - and these are his words: The passion of anger that spins off from the passion in the heart, and any man that is angry by nature, are prone to be enthused with the glowing fire of fervor [for God's service] - see there. Even more certain is that such a person will be filled with anger and rage when he finds a problem or stain in himself. He will have his desire for the good (<i>yetzer hatov</i>) get angry and fling away - even obliterate - the evil within himself. And if he chastises others and rebukes them about their lowliness to their face, he will not mock them nor curse them. Rather he will speak simple words, but words that will seethe like a bubbling cauldron and flow like a raging sea; such that he will melt and uproot even the ills and stains of others.",
        "0_Introduction, 11_Paragraph": "When we see how the younger generation has become heretical and unbridled, God forbid, our hearts are grieved and our hair bristles. It has no faith, fear or Torah [knowledge]. They hate God and His Jewish servants. The directors and heads of yeshivot - whose heads and hearts are in their yeshivot and with their students - only see fine young men before them. So they are consoled, saying, \"It is true that there are many secular Jews now, but Israel is no widow: There are also sons of Zion who are outstanding in halakha and whose hearts are with God.\" Yet they should please stick their heads out of the four cubits of their yeshivot and please see the great masses of secular Jews, God forbid. 'Tyre is only built from the destruction of Jerusalem' - study halls that were full of Torah students have emptied out, and clubs and organizations the goal of which is heresy and the disparaging of Torah, God forbid, have grown in their place.",
        "0_Introduction, 12_Paragraph": "Even craftsmen and businessmen who - though they were not Torah students - were previously faithful Jews, have now become heretics like the youth; they have wandered away and fallen into the pit of destruction, God forbid. So should we just suffice with the nucleus of students in our yeshivot? Is that the entire Jewish nation?",
        "0_Introduction, 13_Paragraph": "And are we even so sure about the students in our yeshivot? Have we already done what is incumbent upon us to do with them? It is true that we can be more certain that the students who have already reached the higher levels - and especially the ones that have become rabbis and filled their insides with Torah and service [to God] - will, with God's help, remain in God's holy sanctuary and involved in divine service. However, will all [our students] reach the higher levels? How many students in the lower levels will find it impossible to continue their studies until then and will, willingly or unwillingly, go out to do business or learn a trade? It is as it is stated in the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 2:1), \"A thousand come in to study, but only one of them goes out to become a rabbi.\" And why should we be certain that on the day after they leave the yeshiva - or shortly thereafter - they will not become unbridled and profane the Shabbat, God forbid, as our saddened eyes have already seen. So why don't we also devise a strategy for them when they are still with us? Is every lad who later becomes unbridled not in our hands when he is a child, being raised in our schools? So why do we leave him and his spirit without a connection to God and His Torah during his childhood, so that it will also exist until the time of his old age?",
        "0_Introduction, 14_Paragraph": "In fact, we have become accustomed to looking to the heretical youth as if only they were to blame about the matter, and as if we were completely clean. But from all of the righteousness of our father, Abraham, God  [specifically] mentioned (Genesis 18:19), \"For I have known him, that he will instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of the Lord.\" Each and every generation in Israel is a loop in the chain of our legacy, the beginning of which is bound to our father, Abraham, and the end of which is with our righteous messiah - may he come speedily in our days. A generation receives its Torah, its faith and its fear [of God] from the generation that preceded it; then uses them to serve God, and passes them on to the next generation. \"That he may instruct his children, etc.\" is the essence of our survival. And if in our generation, the chain were to, God forbid, be interrupted - such that we not pass on the Torah to the next generation - would they truthfully be the only ones to blame? Are they not from the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and do they not have holy souls?",
        "0_Introduction, 15_Paragraph": "And why should we fool ourselves with empty excuses and say, \"We want to pass it on to them, but they are to blame since they refuse to accept it.\" For as greatly as the younger generation is to blame about this and as much as they are refusing to listen, we should nevertheless, I plead, imagine what these sinners of today would have been had they lived in earlier generations. Would they also not have accepted [the Jewish tradition] then? Even with all of their responsibility for this and with their spiritual infirmities - the likes of which did not exist in pervious youth - would not almost all of them also have been tzaddikim, or, at least, simple faithful Jews? That is because their elders, their parents and the whole of their previous generation would have been generally more God-fearing than us. So too, in this matter of educating the younger generation, they were much more God-fearing, and blazed like fiery torches. So they wouldn't have been negligent and simply watched with equanimity and coldness while the younger generation was drowning in the nethermost pit, and the people of God was falling to heresy, God forbid. They would have risen with great noise and sacrificed their entire beings and possessions to save them and educate them in the path of God through various theories and plans.",
        "0_Introduction, 16_Paragraph": "And if so, will we - the generation above them who educates them and bears the obligation to pass on God's holiness, His Torah and His service to them - be able to say with a clear conscience, \"Our hands have not spilled this blood of the Jewish souls into the pit of destruction?\" What shall we say before the One who sits on high? How shall we justify ourselves before the One who dwells in the skies when He comes to take account of His lofty hosts upon the earth and of the younger generation whom He deposited in our hands and entrusted to our responsibility? God will roar from on high and give forth His voice from His holy abode - \"Where are My children, My beloved children, the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? Where are they!\"",
        "0_Introduction, 17_Paragraph": "And if we truly want to repent to God and repair what we have made crooked in this, we must recognize our part of the guilt. For even if they have an infirmity which did not exist earlier in youth, why have we abandoned them without investigation and without curing their spiritual ailment while they were still small and it was possible for us to know how and with what to heal them - since they would then follow everything we would [tell them]? Would a father or guardian of a child congratulate himself by saying, \"I am devoid of guilt for the defects of the child,\" if the beginning of the sickness was only a small infirmity which could have been healed, but on account of his negligence spread and rotted [the child's] limbs? With all of their guilt and all of their corruption, let us please not push all of the guilt only to the youth. We need to feel pain and concern also about our own negligence. And only then will we be able to seek a plan about what to fix and what to do to heal what is broken in our nation. And let us pray to God that He will guide us in His path and remove the heart of stone from our youth, so that we can all merit to serve Him together in truth and with a full heart; and that we may be among those in Israel through whom He is glorified and [about whose child] it will be said, \"Look at this son that I have brought before You!\"",
        "0_Introduction, 18_Paragraph": "Not by conjecture, but by sound methodology and solid facts must we first of all explain the difference between the generations: Why is it that in previous generations any type of education was effective - almost all the students of every teacher and almost all the children of every father were servants of God - but now it is no longer so? The simple and main reason is that youths are thinking that they are already adults before their time. What we are saying is not a fanciful conjecture, as the whole world laments this now. We are not coming to give a reason and cause for this here - as to why children are doing this. But regardless, it is a fact. This spirit of insanity has taken hold of youth to think of themselves as having the intellect and will of adults, while their intellects are still unstable and their wills, unripe and bitter. Moreover, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, informed us from the beginning (Sotah 49b), \"In the time before the messiah, brazenness will grow.\" This too is brazenness, for a child to think of himself and his intellect as trustworthy and reliable, such that they can be depended upon. This has become so accepted that we are sometimes amazed to see this independence and false boldness already bubbling up in the smallest infants who already think of themselves as adults.",
        "0_Introduction, 19_Paragraph": "There are two evils that grow out of this. The first is that as a result, a lad will look at every advisor, teacher and educator as a foreign tyrant that is overbearingly coming to control him and take away his independence, his opinions and his ability to choose. So a type of opposition, even hatred, wells up inside the child towards his teacher and father - to the point that he pays no attention, to listen to their words and how he should internalize them. Instead, he only thinks about how to get rid of them and escape their hands. ",
        "0_Introduction, 20_Paragraph": "And the second - which may cause even more damage than the first - is that it used to be that the personality and independence of a child would not crystallize and develop so quickly while he was still immature. Likewise would his emotions and opinions, as well as his worldview and aspirations, not develop so quickly before their time. The child was a type of blank slate with a pure soul that would absorb the depictions and words that his teachers and rabbis impressed upon him. So they could truly 'stuff him like an ox.' And it was not only words, but their souls that [the teachers] brought into them, and engraved into their souls. And so when the glimmerings of the child's spirit, feelings and aspirations later began to slowly bubble up, they found him as a lad who had already been enriched by the richness of Torah and had been 'anointed with holy anointing oil.' And so the glimmerings of his emotions and aspirations were an additional force and 'extra soul,' to add to the Torah and service of God that his rabbis had brought into him, through which he was educated and in the holiness of which he grew up. This is not the case today when the personality and independence of the child crystallize and develop quickly before their time; and when his emotions, aspirations, opinions and worldview blossom quickly while they are still immature, bitter and poisonous. And it is with them that he begins to examine and investigate every matter (even things that are forbidden to him) as an adult would for himself; and to emote and be enthused with unripe emotions. And is it possible that from his intellect and from his poisonous emotions and enthusiasm, he will piece together a worldview that is not defective and contaminated?",
        "0_Introduction, 21_Paragraph": "If we delve into the spirit of the youth and evaluate them with a pure and completely honest investigation, we would see that a lad will usually not veer from the ways of God at once. He does not profane Shabbat instantly, nor does he suddenly go from the study hall to, mutatis mutandis, the theatres. The Gemara (Shabbat 105b) says, \"That is the craft of the evil inclination. Today it tells him [to] do this, and tomorrow it tells him [to] do that, etc.\" At first glance, we see in the Gemara that only when he is already about to do bad things, God forbid, does he not begin with weighty sins from the start, but rather descends into the pit of destruction gradually. But as we see - even before he comes to the first, most insignificant deed - the internal break in his mind also does not happen suddenly and all at once. Rather a year ago or more, his mind became slightly infirm - infirm, but not infirm. 'It appears like a blemish in the house' - only like a blemish. And the smallest thought bubbles through from it, to look at the Torah and divine service as something disgraceful and as a waste of time; and at the outside world of licentiousness, ignorance and wildness as beautiful and good. Even the most insignificant thing can cause such an infirmity. Since at first, it is tiny and does not do much to him or his deeds, his rabbis - and even his closest friends - do not see any difference in him. But, little by little, it deepens itself into his spirit and spreads into his thoughts, to destroy him, from the spirit to the flesh. Then suddenly a loud voice is heard, that he has left the House of God and fallen into the pit of destruction, God forbid.",
        "0_Introduction, 22_Paragraph": "Generally this internal blemish in the spirit comes from the selfhood and [resulting] opposition written about above. Once he has his own selfhood, and his opposition - even hatred - bubbles up inside him against his father, rabbis and educators, the opposition will not only arise against them. Rather he will also begin to look with scorn and hatred at what they taught him, at their behavior and their path - the holy path.",
        "0_Introduction, 23_Paragraph": "What comes out of our words is that earlier, any advisor or father could educate Jewish children and teach them the path of God, even if he was not exacting to educate \"according to his way\" - according to the way, intellect and essence of each child, as King Solomon hinted to us. Even if he only accustomed and commanded them, he was still successful. For the child was a clean spirit while a youth and even while a young adult. Moreover, he himself felt his own emptiness and the weakness of his intellect inside. So he had an inner thirst inside himself to listen to the words of God from any teacher or advisor. And even if there were times when the lad would be mischievous and refuse to listen, he himself would feel that he had sinned; that his father or teacher who disciplined - or even struck - him was right and that he was the sinner. His spirit would fall a little inside himself and make sure that he would listen to their voice from now on, and negate his will to their will. So that, little by little, he would absorb God's Torah into his being and become a faithful Jew. Though one may have been more of a Ben Torah and one may have been less, they were all Jews who were servants of God.",
        "0_Introduction, 24_Paragraph": "It is not like this now, when the child's selfhood and independence jell early before its time; and together with them, his feelings, aspirations  and worldview are revealed while they are still immature. As a result, the division and hatred between the children and their parents is intensified. The children of our generation who were fit to be faithful Jews have left and are no more. They have turned upon us as enemies, they laugh and scorn us and our faith. And this is what King Solomon saw from the beginning, with the wisdom of God that he had, and warned us to teach the lad according to his way - not only with a command, but with education - to teach each and every one, according to his way.",
        "0_Introduction, 25_Paragraph": "For above we said that the spirit of every Jewish child is a storehouse of holiness; it is just that we need to know how to act upon it; and the same thing is true in this matter. It is true that the personality of the Jewish child has been contaminated by the spirit that has affected all of the world's youth, to jell and develop while still immature; but what personality is it that jells and goes out? Is it not the Jewish personality? Hence we must hasten to soften ourselves to his personality, so that we can grab onto it and act upon it for holiness before he turns into our enemy. If our teacher Moses, all of the prophets and all of the tzaddikim softened themselves from the high levels of their righteousness towards us for our sake, would it not be a sin for us not to soften ourselves towards each [child] - to teach him according to his way? While he is still at a crossroads as to whether to become a faithful servant of God or, God forbid, a Jewish sinner - we must soften ourselves towards him and speak in his language; almost to turn into a child and speak with him according to his intellect and level. ",
        "0_Introduction, 26_Paragraph": "It is not enough to just teach the lad that he is obligated to listen to the educator, and nothing more. For in the end, he will [still] see his rabbi as his opponent and as a foreign tyrant, as mentioned earlier. The main point is to bring this opinion into his heart: To know that he - the child himself - is the main educator. He is not a minor and a lad. Rather, he is the sprout of God's planting in the garden of Israel. And God has placed the responsibility to nurture and educate this sprout upon him, himself - to be a great tree of life and to make himself into a servant of God, a tzaddik and a Torah great. But since his intellect and his spirit are young, there is much Torah that he has not learned and his evil impulse is active - if he is God-fearing and does not want to sin towards God and to destroy the vineyard of the the Lord of hosts - he will need to listen to the Torah of God and His path from his rabbi and his father, whether regarding that which is explicit in the Torah and in the Shulchan Arukh or whether regarding that which is not. The Torah was not sparing in warning about [the importance of] listening to the father and the educator: \"Ask your father and he will tell you; your elder, etc.\" (Deuteronomy 32:7); \"you may not veer, etc.\" (Deuteronomy 17:11); \"Listen, my son, to the rebuke of your father\" (Proverbs 1:8). And the wayward and rebellious son (Deuteronomy 21:18-21) has not done any sin that is explicit in the written or oral Torah, and yet the Torah is very stringent about it, because his father and mother said, \"He did not listen to our voice.\" And his very identity is not called, glutton and drunkard, based on his actions; but it is rather called, wayward and rebellious, because he is rebellious to his father and his educator. And [other examples] can be found in the verses.",
        "0_Introduction, 27_Paragraph": "And as much as possible, the father and educator should make the lad understand and internalize this in his mind and intellect - that the obligation is upon the child to develop and educate himself into a Jewish adult, a tree in God's garden in Eden. And the father or the educator is just the guide that will instruct him on how to educate himself, and about what God said - like one who comes to ask a question in matters of what is forbidden and what is permissible. [There] the law is given by the decisor who advises one as to what is kosher, etc. But the main practitioner in the home is the homeowner - it is solely his responsibility that it be kosher and that he get rid of what is forbidden and unfit. And we gain much when we instruct him like this. First, when he will develop with this opinion, he will not see his father or teacher as a foreign tyrant and ruler who wants to rule over him, since the obligation is upon himself. So it is he - with his selfishness and selfhood that have already developed in him - who is the ruler, and the one educating himself. And he must additionally be grateful to his father and his teacher for helping him [with this] and lightening his load.",
        "0_Introduction, 28_Paragraph": "We also stand to gain that even the lads that are not distancing themselves from us so much and are not turning into enemies - but rather only disregarding their divine service from laziness and neglect - will also be stimulated to redouble their service. As the Gemara says (Eruvin 3a), \"A stew belonging to two people will be neither hot nor cold\" - it is a law of human nature that when one has on whom to rely, he will be neglectful and depend on the other. And so too a lad - even if he does not resist - will be neglectful by thinking that his father or teacher will do everything for him. But when he understands that the obligation is upon him and that only he himself is the guide and educator, he will make efforts and not be neglectful.",
        "0_Introduction, 29_Paragraph": "However with these things alone, we will not yet have fulfilled our obligation. For even if we delve into the independent selfhood of the lad's mind and make him understand to the point that he grasps intellectually that he bears the responsibility, and will want to strengthen himself in his divine service - nevertheless, have we not already said that it is not only his intellect that comes out prematurely to be like that of an independent adult? Rather it is the selfhood also in his emotions, his excitations and even his enthusiasm that cause him to be excited and enthused by the imagined beauty of the stupidities of the world - such as the theaters and all the other types of licentiousness and unbridledness in the world. So if we ourselves do not stimulate his spirit early on, to get excited from every commandment and to be enthused by the light of God's Torah, we will have done nothing, God forbid. As even if he will grasp intellectually that he bears the obligation to educate himself, his emotions and passions will nevertheless make him veer from the good path to the path that even he himself understands is bad. For is it not that most sinners themselves understand that their deeds are bad at first? Yet it is the excitement of their desires that overpowers their intellects, to make them fall into the pit of destruction. ",
        "0_Introduction, 30_Paragraph": "And this is the essence of Chassidut. That a man not suffice with just his intellect in determining [the contours of] his service. For the connection of the intellect alone is not an enduring connection. He may subjugate it and know clearly in his mind that he must only serve God in all the details of his thought, speech and action - but his heart and all of his body be far removed. [Hence] he must connect his whole spirit, and the life force in his entire body; he must delve into his spirit to elevate it and stimulate it, that it should be enthused, spiritually delighted and rejoice over every commandment, by Torah and by prayer. And when he connects his spirit and even the life force in his body - beside the fact that the commandment and the service that he does will be more elevated and more holy - he will also be more certain that he will be able to stand up against his evil impulse and not be torn away from the Source of Life and cast quickly into the pit of destruction by the seduction of his evil impulse.",

For it is difficult for a child to be enthused with true Chassidic enthusiasm. As even in general, whenever the Torah writes [both] statutes (<i>chukim</i>, laws the reasons for which are not obvious) and judgments (<i>mishpatim</i>, laws the reasons for which are apparent), it has the statutes come before the judgements. As the judgements are with discernment - and not just intellectual discernment, but also discernment of awareness. For just because a child does not [yet] have intellect, is he not clear and aware why he wants to kiss his father with his lips? Just the opposite, this is the essence of awareness! His heart desires to kiss his father, and this is more certain that any intellectual matter in the world.",

And that for which he is not excited at all, in his mind or in his heart, is a statute. At first, the Jewish adult has to do many commandments, immerse himself in Torah and service and give himself - his mind, his thoughts and all of his spirit - over to God. And then the more he immerses himself in service and holiness, the more he will feel - at fortuitous times - how his spirit goes out and draws near to holiness and the Supernal Light. [At those times,] his soul attaches itself to God's soul, and he - and even his body - becomes enthused, is in awe, rejoices, yearns and takes pleasure. [But] at first, there are statutes that must be done, even without discernment and without emotion. And afterwards are the judgements with discernment and enthusiasm. So a child must first engage with the statutes, to immerse himself in them without feeling or enthusiasm.",

If we do not move quickly to grab onto [the child's] enthusiasm - to harness it and to move it towards excitement about holiness - it will emote and become excited with enthusiasm for silliness and for the reviled 'beauty' of the world, to be impressed by their ways and to covet their ugly mischief. For with the lad of our generation whose emotions and impressions have already matured and become pronounced, it is difficult to still connect him to statutes without emotions, or even to intellectual matters if it is only done with dry intellect. We must delve into his soul, arouse it and have it enthused - such that it feel at least a little of the pleasantness of the illumination of the illumination of the Highest Splendor, that it yearn for and connect [to it].",

Rather we must educate them in the ways of true Chassidut from when they are still small. \"Teach (<i>Chanokh</i>) the lad according to his way!\" And the way required by the youth of our generation is true, hearty and spiritual Chassidut. And even if this will not yet be true chassidic enthusiasm, [the child] will nevertheless reach the 'edge of the staff' and connect.

When the spring flows in his mind, he will find ten levels in this thing. As the colors that appear to our eyes, or in our physical mind's eye, impact on the [level of the] spiritual; the essence is stimulated by the spirit; and the soul by the essence.

But the child can remain on the level of physical stimulation and excitement. Nevertheless, even in him is there still a type of spark and the slightest filament of illumination of the spirit, shining from a distance. And this too is good, since even this is enough to connect his small body and spirit. For a lad that is excited on the night of Passover by the cleaning of the room, by the multitude of candles, by the beautifully set table is also good. As his body is excited, but his spirit is [also] bubbling inside and excited by the recitation of the Haggadah - to say it with a little enthusiasm to God - even though he doesn't know what it is and what it is about.",

And even though they will not connect to their actual souls and they will not attain true spiritual enthusiasm - but rather only a physical one - that is also good. Since he will be emoting from holiness - his physical emotions would be from holiness - he will be connected through it. So when he grows older, it will be easier for him to be a true chassid.

He said something humorous so they would be happy, since the Divine Presence only resides amidst joy - as the Gemara says there. However the Torah is like a hammer that breaks apart a boulder which lets off many sparks and many explanations. So in our generation, the Gemara is also hinting to a path for the rabbi or the teacher: The teacher must make efforts to win over the heart of the student and to keep bringing him close. And joy is one of the main vehicles through which he can win him over. The spirit of a child does not tolerate sadness, and the teacher should never appear to him like an irritable or disputative person.",

Even when he shows them something humorous, the student should tremble. And even when he puts fear upon him, there should be a pinch of joy mixed in. \"And rejoice with trembling\" (Psalms 2:11). [The child] should tremble in front of him differently than he does in front of an irritable, angry or violent man; but rather with fear that comes from honor, like from one of the lofty ones. If the rabbi is similar to an angel of the Lord of hosts when he gets angry at [the child], the student will not hate him on its account. And when he shows him a pleasant face, he will rejoice and love him and fear him even more.",

Moreover, to 'rebuke the wise man,' as above is needed in order for us to bring the heart of the lad close. It is also intrinsically very effective educationally, in that it brings out the physical and mental strengths of the student from their hiding places, to strengthen and galvanize them for Torah and service. There is a [relevant] analogy about someone who people are praising to his face as being generous. It is then possible that he will be strengthened to give a contribution that he was previously unable to overcome his own spirit and give. [But] since they praised him as generous like this, they drew out the strength of his spirit to come out and overpower his trait of stinginess. The teacher and the parent must find a good trait in the student and praise him about it and strengthen him. They should say, \"You have great talent and ability towards greatness in Torah and service, etc. waiting in you. If you only strive, you will reach it.\" Yet the father or teacher must do this with intelligence and understanding, so that it will not bring the student to pride or negligence. ",

The Sages, may their memory be blessed, already said (Sifrei Devarim 49:3), \"Do you wish to know the One who spoke and brought the world into being? Learn aggadah.\" And the more advanced student can study [it] on his own. And when the teacher wants to speak about a matter from the books of Mussar (ethical instruction), it is good for him to not only speak about things related to punishments, but rather also about things related to the greatness of the Jewish soul and its coming close to God and raising itself up to the state of the angels. For even though the spirit of the lad is humbled by rebuke and punishment - not only does only speaking about this not bring him closer, it can also bring to light his aforementioned infirmity. But when he also speaks at length about the greatness of the Jew - also the words of rebuke will be effective, and the lad will be stimulated and enthused.",

And one must be very exacting with a parable, to tell it properly in order as if the story actually happened. For this is the way of a child: Even though he knows that it is only a parable - when he hears it, he nevertheless sees the story in his imagination as if it actually happened. And he is more excited and aroused by it than by the analog (the lesson learned through it). And so in Chapter 3 of this book, we expanded on the parable a bit, even though it was not necessary for the main teaching - we described the behavior of the shoemaker and his prayer in such a way that the child will be enthused about it, and to be a little aroused not to covet this world so much, but rather to come closer to God through Torah and true service.

And see Zohar, 2:98a:2, that one thirteen and above is called a son of the Congregation of Israel, in the sense of (Psalms 2:7), \"I have begotten you today...\"</i>) The Jewish lads that study Torah are very beloved to the Holy One, blessed be He.

Hence it is up to us to search for every trace that can hold you back in your learning and in your connection to God, and to expel it. But we will only search together with you. And together with you will we inspect you to see and find and destroy the crumbs of chametz and the specks of rot inside you. For who is your main educator if not yourself? And who has the main responsibility of educating and raising the Jewish lads and young men - the cedars of Lebanon and Torah giants - if not you, yourselves, the lads and young people? And who like you will know your shortcomings that need to be fixed? And who like you is able to know so well your aberrations - which differ and vary according to each lad - and to straighten them out? We can only assist you, prepare the straight path for you, teach you and say, \"This way, this path or this trail is crooked, and the person that walks on it will reach the nethermost pit and the 'other side,' God forbid. (<i>Editor's note from the printed edition: As there can be a man who follows the Torah in all of his actions, but abberates and is lenient in what appears to him to be minor things. Though his path is good, he may also descend to the pit, God forbid, because of the error he made on a small path or small trail to the side.</i>) However this way, path or trial is straight, and the one who walks on it will reach the forearms of God and the glory of the majesty of His holiness, may He be blessed.\" But any father, teacher or guide can only tell you and advise you. It is up to you to listen to him, to act and educate yourself according to his path and what he tells you and to internalize every thought that comes out of his mouth into all the chambers of your heart and being, so that it shall be well for you. But if, God forbid, you refuse and rebel, who or what will help you, to save your spirits from the husk (<i>klipah</i>) that kidnaps Jewish spirits, God forbid? Only you, yourselves, are able to search the recesses of your heart and the nooks and crannies of your spirits to find their shortcomings - everyone according t0 his personality - and to fix them. So we will only speak about some of them and explain their remedies. But you will be able to learn from them how to seek, find and fix all of your issues.",
        "1_, 2_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "There are some people, both great and small, who are not aware of their own shortcomings. And even when they see that such and such a trait is bad in Mussar books, it nevertheless does not cross their mind that they have such a trait and that they need to fix it. Neither do they feel pain or worry about it. This is not a good sign for [this person]. For this is the way of sick people, to not feel their sickness getting worse or even to know that they are sick. (See Rambam's Eight Chapters 3.) But there are also adults and youths with the following trait: His heart inside begins to feel that he has a certain shortcoming and he [then] begins to worry and be in pain. But his mind quickly rationalizes it, by saying, \"Is it not that the shortcoming I have is not as bad as what the book is criticizing? And the small amount that I have is almost impossible to remove, since 'there is no righteous man in the world who never sins.'\" This too is a partner to the evil impulse, and [such a person's] end will be the pollution of his spirit and the darkness of <i>Gehinnom</i>. The root of both of these is that they do not seek greatness from themselves. They imagine that only tzaddikim and greats must work to better themselves, but it is sufficient for all other Jews to just be anything that they are. This is like a father who has a fool for a son, so that his father does not require much from him and suffices with the little good found in him. And he even overlooks his sins, saying, \"Is he not a fool?\" But such a man (who rationalizes his own shortcomings) is greatly mistaken. And we have already spoken above about how everyone must strive, help and reveal the tzaddikim, the greats and the giants of the Jewish people; and how the Divine Presence laments the negligent person. But even if he just wants to be a simple Jew - why is he forgetting what a simple Jew is, and the condition that God made with each Jew, from the woodchopper to the water-drawer, when He first came to make them into the Jewish people and to give them the Torah? He said (Exodus 19:5-6), \"Now then, if you will obey Me faithfully and keep My covenant, you shall be My treasured possession among all the peoples, etc. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\" This is the Jew - [someone from] a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. It was a condition that the Holy One, blessed be He, made: \"Now then, if etc.\" Only if so, will you be Jews. But if not, God forbid...",
        "1_, 2_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "And who amongst you, Jewish lads, would refuse to be a Jew, God forbid? And who would not demand from himself [to do whatever is required] to say, \"I am a Jew, I am a servant of God, and I would work with all of my strength and mind - and even all of my physical and spiritual existence - to merit to be a Jew.\" And since each one of you would demand this of himself, it is already impossible that he should not find his shortcomings and that his heart will not be pained and not [seek to] justify them. Instead he will work with all of his ability to fix and set them straight.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "<b>The Illness of Laziness and Laxity and its Remedy</b>",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "Laziness is the most harmful and common illness in youth. Yet, like most other illnesses, it too varies among different youths. There is a lad who is totally lazy: He loves to sleep and walk idly, and any work is a burden to him. He has various excuses for everything, as stated in the verse (Proverbs 26:13 ), \"A lazy man says, 'There’s a cub on the road, a lion in the squares.'\" He is always righteous in his own eyes, since he is full of excuses. And he always finds the shortcomings of someone better than himself who works. That way, he can justify himself in his heart and not be embarrassed or jealous about not working as hard as him. And even if he will occasionally redouble his efforts and take measures to work, he will quickly waver. He will study consistently only for a week or two at the beginning of the winter or summer (semesters), but no more. If you, God forbid, have such a bad trait, please quickly remove it. Remove it and take it out from its roots. It is disgusting and disgraceful, and it destroys everything like rot inside the bones.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "Please answer me, lazy young man, in what way are you better than the rest of the world? The sun and moon do their work without stop. Even the earth - [after] we plow it, arrange it and plant it - gives all of its strength to its work that God appointed it to do; to grow and develop [plants]. The ox, the horse and all the beasts of burden work with all of their strength. It is only harmful creatures and predatory animals that walk around idly and only desire to tear and trample each other apart. So why should you be like one of them, to walk around idly? Please note that with all of the sacrifice that they put into their great work, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, also sought to arouse themselves [to do even better] with rebuke from the world: So Rabbi Eliezer, who had always come to the study hall before the other rabbis and students and left it after all the others had left, nevertheless once saw that the fertilizer workers and the workers of the fields got up earlier than him for their work. So he rebuked himself, saying, \"They get up so early for their plain work, so how could I who does the holy service of God start later today?\" (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1:1:9) You should please reflect - the builder works with great sacrifice on the heights of the buildings the whole day; the farmer works his land with the sweat of his brow. And how much sweat and energy does your father expend to bring forth his sustenance also for you? All people work - one with his head and one with his limbs - but they all 'break their backs' in their work. Yet you want to walk around idly? Why should the heavens and the earth curse you and say one to the other, \"Please see - we and all of our descendants do what our God, Master and Creator has appointed us to do and all work. But this young man is lazing around and acting haughtily over us by walking around idly!\"",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "But even if you are not afflicted with the terrible illness of laziness and your body and spirit have not been infected with the poison of idleness, you are still not free from searching for and cleansing yourself from the traces of laziness which are called laxity. Though not as dangerous as laziness - if it grabs a person, it can nevertheless also disturb him from bringing out everything that he can bring out and impede him from climbing the path that rises to the house of God. Please remember that the Torah was given from the Heavens; and that to be a Jew who studies Torah and serves God is an ascent to the shade under the wings of the Divine Presence. So one can only arrive at it with work, redoubling of efforts and exertion.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "Any work is measured by the value of what it can acquire. Cheap and silly things can be acquired with almost no work. Things more expensive than that are acquired with more work. So one can only acquire Torah and be in His holy shade with hard work; but not with work that is too hard or too much for man's capabilities. For God, may He be blessed, did not give us work that is beyond our strength and our abilities. Yet we must redouble our efforts and exert ourselves in it - not to just work in it when it comes to us, but rather to be a worker in one's essence and not be lax. And King Solomon said (Proverbs 18:9), \"Even one who is lax in his work is a brother to him who destroys.\" The lazy one does not want to work at all, so he is one who destroys. While the lax one does work when something that must be done comes to his attention, he, himself, is not a true worker. He falls asleep on the job and takes his time for no reason. He wants to do a superficial job and does not exert himself or invest himself in it. But the industrious person is himself a true worker. He seeks to work because it is impossible for him to walk around idly. And when he has no control over it and a few hours - and all the more so, a whole day - go by without work, he is disgusted with himself and sees himself as contaminated. Work is his life and his pleasure. He is not satisfied with easy work, nor will superficiality soothe his work-hungry spirit. He works with alacrity and happily invests of himself. He is like a stream of water that builds up when impeded and gains strength, when stopped, in order to break through and surge. He too becomes more resolved with each impediment; and each delay only furthers his anticipation to surge and work more.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "But behold that even though the illness of laziness is worse than the illness of laxness; it is nevertheless more difficult to cure the lax one than the lazy one. That is to say that if he wants it, a lazy lad has more vehicles to distance himself from the trait of laziness than he does from the trait of laxness. For when he is still in the yeshiva, both his father and his teacher will pile on work for him and he will need to get up early in the morning, arrive at the set time to the yeshiva, learn a certain amount of material each week, etc. And through this, he will become accustomed not to be lazy also when he grows older. But this is not the case for one who is lax. It will be more difficult for him - whether he is intrinsically lax or whether he had been lazy and moved past it, but only to the point of laxness - to cleanse himself of it. For both when he gets up and when he works, it is all with laxness and superficiality - whether it is in his studies or in any other type of divine service: When he comes to get rid of a bad trait, he will not be exacting to take it out from its roots and to fix it in every way. In prayer, he will not exert himself to have intention for the meaning of the words, since he only wants superficiality and ease. So he prefers to think superficially rather than to concentrate on the words he is saying in front of the Master of the World.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "Therefore, Jewish young man, if you care about yourself and about the years of your life until you reach old age and seniority - expel laziness from yourself and take out the rot of laxness from its roots, so as to destroy it from yourself. Bring yourself to alacrity and be an industrious person. Not that you should be hasty in all of your actions like impulsive people. For even with all of their hastiness, they are still lax and most of their actions are superficial, without the deeper work that requires the entire body and mind. Be deliberate, but industrious, exertive and alacritous. And since we have already told you that you yourself are in fact your main educator, we will hence explain the mental and physical differences between someone who is lax and someone who is industrious a little more, so that you yourself will consider how and with what to remove laxness in every matter and in every detail, and how to turn yourself completely into an industrious person.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 7_Paragraph": "All matters that a person does - whether physical actions of the body or mental actions of the brain - are done by the spirit through the brain, the heart and the other parts of the body in which it is encased. There are many parts of the brain, yet at the time that the soul is encased in them, they are all stimulated and ready to do their jobs for the one goal of understanding the thing upon which he is focused. Likewise if an action is to be done with the limbs, all of the limbs and capabilities are aroused to the one goal of doing such and such an action. But the spirit of one who is lax does not arise with much strength. Instead he is in a type of trance. For you can see that even when a person is sleeping, not all of a person's brain is sleeping and idle. As even then, it works a little to form the dreams seen by his spirit or those that are merely coming from his thoughts of the past day. So too, the lax person - even when he is awake - is like that which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, \"the one who sits idly, is as if he is asleep.\" He is not actually sleeping. His spirit is more awake than if it was truly sleeping, but it has not completely arisen and awoken. It is slumbering but not slumbering, awake but not awake. The parts of his brain and his [various] limbs are not exerting themselves and seeking to join and work together. His soul has not arisen to be encased and to give the full vigor and strength to his limbs. He is lacking the life of a strong individual that redoubles his efforts and works successfully; lacking effort and vigorous life. And this is why he is called lax (<i>mitrapeh</i>), which is an expression that connotes frailty and weakness. It is not a weakness of the body, but of the spirit; such that it does not exert itself to arise and grab onto the abilities of the brain and the body, to require them to strive and be exacting. He does not [even] have a picture or model of the work he needs to do. He does not even have delight or enjoyment. ",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 8_Paragraph": "However please let us ask you, lax young man, why is it that when you need to go on a trip that you love and are happy about, you quickly turn into an industrious person? You get up early in the morning, you get dressed in a few minutes and you do everything with precision and alacrity. And why is it on a Shabbat that comes on the eve of Passover, you are quick to do all your actions with alacrity, whereas you are otherwise always late - very late - with them? You normally do them while yawning and dozing off, so that these actions have no flavor or aroma. That is because the work is beloved to you and your spirit is happy about it, so it rises with strength and grabs onto all the parts of your brain and body and fills them with vigor. They exert themselves rather than being faint, are awake rather than dozing off. So why is it that your service - holy service - is not as beloved to you, to the point where your soul arises for it - to arouse vigorous life, exert your brain and body until they all work industriously, energetically and joyously?",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 9_Paragraph": "There are many people whose hearts are one with God and always desiring to serve Him; and when you talk with them, it seems like they are totally immersed in that service - from tip to toe. In fact, however, it is only something they want, whereas they actually remain lowly and small. For whenever they start to desire it and take it upon themselves to act, the evil impulse brings on impediments, such that they are immediately seduced and pushed away. But if they were strong and firm, alacritous and industrious, they would not have been pushed away by every impediment large or small. Rather with the spirit of service - divine service - they would redouble their efforts over everything else, and progress. But since their laxness has been a part of them all the way from childhood, they are neglectful about strengthening themselves and overcoming every impediment. So you too should not rejoice in your good will by itself, unless you remove and take out your laxness from its roots. But if you don't plant alacrity and industriousness in yourself, your evil impulse will impede you, and you will, God forbid, fail.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 10_Paragraph": "If our words to you up until now - how the whole people of Israel and even the Holy One of Israel are waiting on you, and how it is in your power to be a Jew, to sanctify the Jewish people and to have the Master of the world dwell in His world that He created - do not suffice to arouse your spirit, such that it should not be lazy or lax, but rather alacritous and industrious; then listen to this parable and illustration.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 11_Paragraph": "There is a story of a poor Jewish shoemaker in the Land of Israel who lived near a crossroads. All of his livelihood was from the passersby. If one of them tore their shoe, he would fix it; if their straps would snap, he would replace it. His livelihood was tight, but he - along with his wife and children - was always at ease. For he feared God greatly and also taught the members of his household that the life of a man in this earthly existence is short and temporary; and that the essence is the eternal life in the supernal world, in which the soul is delighted by its closeness to the splendor of the precious Kingdom of Heaven and in which it derives pleasure from the light of His Divine Presence, may He be blessed. So what does all of a man's fortune help, if he is idle, does not serve his God and does not get close to Him? He was not a scholar. But according to his ability, he would study and pray to God every spare moment that he had, by day and by night. And sometimes his spirit would be aroused and become very enthusiastic, so that he would pray and pour out his soul to God. In order that nothing should disturb or confuse him, he would leave his small house and his one-room dwelling and go to the forest near him. When passersby saw him from afar, they suddenly saw a man whose face was on fire. And as he would praise, thank, laud and speak to God as if his eyes of flesh could see the majesty of His throne of glory in front of him - [the passersby] were astounded and afraid. But those who knew him were already aware of this, and said that it was certainly the pious shoemaker - since that is what he was called by his gentile acquaintances.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 12_Paragraph": "And it was at the beginning of the last war (World War I), when all the wayfarers ceased, that his meager livelihood was also interrupted. A day came when there was no bread for him, his wife or his children. Behold that they went hungry the next day as well. And his small children were fasting and crying out, \"Oy father, give us bread, so we don't die of starvation.\" And behold that on the third day they were all lying down, weak, and humming like doves, \"Father, bread.\" Due to the severity of the famine, only their lips were moving, but their voices could not be heard. They did not have the strength to yell out. He too was weak and his knees buckled from the fast and from the great sadness in his heart for his wife and his children. So he strengthened himself and went outside. His wife yelled, \"Oy my husband, do not leave. If we must die of famine, let us all die together.\" But even then did his trust in God not go away. So he said, \"I am not going to my death. Rather I am going to the Living God, going to the forest to pray to my Father in the Heavens, that he should make a miracle for us and that we should live.\"",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 13_Paragraph": "And he walked along, crying and raising his eyes to the Heavens and he said, \"Please God, even before You created Your world, You chose us to be Your children, Your servants that are close to You. Your holy Divine Presence dwelt with us continuously in the Land, and You raised us up on the wings of eagles even into the Heavens - as it were - into to Your forearms and Your bosom. And how good was it for us then - when there was something to tell us, You told us. You did not only have us hear the majesty of Your voice from the Heavens, but You also spoke with us. You revealed Yourself though a prophet and we heard the voice of God talking through a man amongst us. The whole world too shuddered in front of You and in front of us. For who is there that is made of flesh who will not fear people among whom the Master of the world dwells, whom He surrounds and even in whose bodies and spirits He resides? But how bitter is it for us now, when You have hidden Your face from us! The heart pines for Your hidden holiness. The spirit yells out, 'Bring me close, Father,' but noone is listening. For even when a Jew meditates about repentance and thinks, 'Is it not because of the greatness of my sins that God has distanced Himself? Let us repent to Him and serve Him, and He will return to us like a merciful father' - even then, it is still bitter for us. For since You have hidden Yourself from us, so many hardships have overwhelmed us - whether in matters of livelihood or whether in other matters - which seal up the heart and worry the spirit, to the point that they make us transgress against our Maker, God forbid. Master of the World, I am not praying only for myself, but rather for all of Your children, the Children of Israel. Merciful Father, how have You abandoned Your children in such a sad and threatening world? How can You look on and be silent when they are wallowing in the blood of their wounds? But I am not only requesting their livelihood; rather I am seeking You, my beloved Father and the holiness of my King, of my Holy One. Bring us close; reveal Yourself to us; have mercy upon us; redeem us and send us Your righteous messiah now, so that we will serve You in fear and in love, as our hearts desire and hope.\"",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 14_Paragraph": "And it was while he was crying and praying so much that he tired. Since he had nothing to refresh himself from the fast and the crying, he fainted. And then he smelled a very pungent pleasant smell, such that his spirit was lifted a bit. And he saw a very beautiful flower growing in the forest, and the pleasant smell was coming from it. So he strengthened himself, stood up and plucked the flower. And then he hurried home to also revive the souls of his wife and children, at least a little. But as he was on the road, a carriage passed with a lord inside. The carriage stopped and the lord called to him, \"Listen poor man, what are you doing with a flower like that? Give it to me and I will compensate you with money.\" So the poor man answered, \"I will not sell it for money. Rather if you can give me a loaf of bread for my wife and children that have been dying from hunger these last three days, I will give you the flower and even bless you in front of God.\" So he sold him his flower for the bread and he ran happily home.

        "1_, 3_Chapter, 15_Paragraph": "And during the night, he saw his father in a dream tearing his clothes, yelling out, crying and striking his breast. He said, \"You should know that the prayer you prayed today in the forest came up with a great noise above, such that all of the angels of mercy were aroused and yelled out to God, 'Until when will You not have mercy upon Your downtrodden flock and upon Your children drowning in so many hardships? And yet they do not forget Your name and are so connected to You!' The iron partition that is between the people of Israel and their Father in the Heavens was about to be broken, and all of the prayers that the Jews have prayed from way back that had not risen, now arose and aroused the mercy of the Master of mercy to reveal the end. And the proclamation went out [that] since you brought the end near with your prayer, the flower that can resurrect the dead will be revealed to you. (<i>Editor's note from the written edition: See Kohelet Rabbah 5, that there is a grass for the resurrection of the dead that will be revealed to an individual.</i>) And they sent me to come to you in a dream at night to let you know that you should go to the Tomb of the Patriarchs and the other graves of the prophets and resurrect them, and they would bring our righteous messiah. There was light and joy in all of the heavens and the supernal chambers; the supernal angels and the souls of the righteous ones rejoiced. But a great noise and lament was made by the Satan and his group - what will they do from now on? So they took counsel to trick you and to take this flower from your hand. And that is the lord that bought the flower from you - he was a messenger of the Satan, who hid his identity to steal the flower of the resurrection.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 16_Paragraph": "And woe is me now, my son! You have not only done damage to yourself, but to all of Israel, even to the Holy One of Israel. Everything was in your hands, the forefathers, the prophets, all of the tzaddikim - even the messiah was in your hands. And you lost everything for the sake of a loaf of bread! So now it is the Satan and all of the destructive angels that are happy and laughing and making fun of us, whereas we are all ashamed and crying. And everyone is crying out and asking, 'Who was that man that destroyed all of these things and extinguished the holy light; could it be that it was a Jewish man who is called by the name of Israel?'\"",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 17_Paragraph": "And now Jewish young man, are you very worried about this poor man who destroyed everything holy, the tzaddikim and the coming of the messiah for something of little value? But if you are worried for him, when he had little chance to do otherwise, since he did not know he was facing a test, you should certainly worry - and even get angry - about yourself. For you know that you are constantly being tested [about this], and you nevertheless bend to every small thing and do not stand your ground. Being a giant and a tzaddik is in your hand, to have God's Divine Presence dwell within you, such that others too will be sanctified by you and be brought closer to God through you and be taught the work of God by you and guided on His paths; and you and your friends can bring the revelation of our righteous messiah closer. And what does your desire alone to be a true Jew help if you are lazy and lax and don't work; if you are pushed away be every impediment; jump at whatever appears good in your eyes and never stand your ground in the face of a test large or small? It is not our intention that you should be alacritous and only make your service like an industrious craftsman of the mundane, mutatis mutandi, when his boss hurries him or he pushes himself. For his work is only the dry work of the limbs of the body. Rather, arouse your spirit! Let the the spirit of God lift you up to put thunder into the wheels of your spirit and the limbs of your body; exert yourself and redouble your efforts to serve God with effort, joy and the enthusiasm of holy fire!",

        "1_, 4_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "The desire that you have to be industrious and to serve God is not enough by itself. You need to  delve into it and find ideas and tactics to remove laxness, take it out from its roots and instill industriousness in yourself. This is the case with any traits - it is not enough to just have the desire that your bad traits go away and to exchange them for good traits. Rather, you must delve into them to find various ideas and tactics to help you with them. For bad character traits are a sickness of the spirit and the body - would a sick person be healed by the will to be healed alone, if he does not make any efforts and occupy himself with his healing? And regarding the topic of laziness and laxness with which we are dealing - since you yourself are your main educator, delve into your illness; exert yourself to rule over and monitor yourself!",
        "1_, 4_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "Before any task in your divine service, consider how much time it requires, and monitor yourself. For example, take an hour for this page of Gemara, or review it in half an hour and no more. And before each task, monitor yourself by setting up strong limits - \"I will not be negligent in this, but rather finish it in this amount of time.\" And once you have finished it, see if you have not delayed. If not, rejoice! But if you did delay - and not because of an [unforeseen but legitimate] impediment - you should be saddened and greatly angered with yourself, saying, \"Gevalt! What will be with me? I am now destroying two worlds with my lowly laziness, and angering my Maker as a result.\" And when you get accustomed to it, and this monitoring of yourself becomes ingrained and you will have made it into a heavy yoke on your neck - then whenever you study [Torah], you will feel inside as if someone is standing over you and pushing you, saying, \"Do not be lax; do not err in your thoughts to think of other thoughts in the middle of your study.\"",
        "1_, 4_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Even if a lax young man is already able to study in depth on his own - it is nevertheless better that when he studies alone, he should study more simply. So he should assign an amount of time to every part of his learning - in an hour, he should study so much Gemara; in half an hour, so much Tanakh, etc. For when he studies with more depth - besides the fact that he will not be able to set aside a certain time for each thing and to hurry himself, given that there is no set time for in-depth study - he will also err and get confounded by other thoughts. Of course, he should also not refrain from in-depth study, since that it is the essence of Torah study - to delve with all of his strength and thought into the holiness of Torah. So the main seduction of the evil impulse to the lax person is to seduce him to only study superficially, without work and without depth. However when he wants to study in depth, he should do so with his rabbi or with one of his good friends. That way, they will arouse each other not to stray and not be lax. And once he becomes used to being alacritous and industrious - and not lazy or lax - he can already study in depth also when he is studying by himself. ",
        "1_, 4_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "A young man who has already finished and left the yeshiva - such that his time and studies are not fixed by the director of the yeshiva or his teacher - should fix leaning sessions for the whole day without adding a great deal all at once. When several days have passed and he has completed his studies every day - he can add a little. For example, if he took upon himself to study a page of Gemara with Rashi and Tosafot for two hours every morning - after a few days, he should say to himself, \"Behold I can study the parsha with Rashi during those two hours, without taking away from the Gemara and Tosafot. I will gird my loins and study with greater industriousness, strength, willpower and intellect, and there will be about a quarter of an hour left for Chumash and Rashi.\" And so should he add, little by little, until he has piled on many sessions of Torah study and service every day.",
        "1_, 4_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "It is good for you to write down the entire day's schedule on paper. For example - in the morning at time x, I will get up; at time y, I will have already gotten dressed, washed my hands, recited the Shema and the Torah blessings and I will begin to study until time z, etc. And every day you should look at your list to fulfill your portion. Even a student in yeshiva - if he only wants it - can push himself and add sessions to the sessions of the yeshiva. And why should you dither and waste so much time at lunch break and at night, from the time you leave the yeshiva until you go to bed? Why don't you steal a little time from this and from that to be time for God? And whether you are a yeshiva student or study on your own - you will get so accustomed to the sessions that you set for yourself the whole day, and they will be so regular for you every day and every hour - and even every minute - that they will be like an ironclad rule. So much so that if something prevents you from finishing one of the tasks, you will be saddened on your own and feel like you breached the wall of that day. And so the Chumash session or the half hour of Gemara that you missed that day will yell out to you, \"Why did you abandon me and trample me?\"",
        "1_, 4_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "Everyday, check your daily schedule to see if you didn't miss anything yesterday. If something prevented you and you neglected it - if it was out of your own neglect, God forbid, that you neglected it, be saddened and immediately finish what you missed the previous day, today. However if it was because you studied something difficult or you delved deeper into your studies that you neglected it, you should not be pained. Nor do you need to make up today the number of pages you missed yesterday. For the quota that we mentioned that you should set a number of pages for yourself every day is only for simpler learning, or for the one who has not repulsed laxness. He must set out a number of pages each day and each hour so that he not be neglectful and spend too much time on one page for no reason. But regarding the one who studies in depth without laxness and spends more time [on a page] because he is adding to his service and divine investigation in the Gemara and Tosafot, etc. - just the opposite, how fortunate he is and how good is his portion! This is the essence of Torah study, through which we merit to cling to God. Such a student should set out his sessions of in-depth study by the hour and not by the page - how many hours he will study in-depth, not how many pages. And however many pages, or even sides, he learns will suffice for him. And do not think that since you put so much work on yourself, you will become accustomed to fooling yourself and learning everything only superficially. Since you will want to make up the quantity of your voluminous service that you accepted upon yourself, it will be just the opposite. Know this rule: The yoke of all the work you pile upon yourself will arouse you to work - not just much work quantitatively that is done superficially; but rather work with depth and precision. Redouble your efforts and exert yourself, so that your entire self will turn into industriousness, to do hard work that breaks even the body. Just the opposite, if you do not feel your responsibility and the yoke upon yourself to finish much material each day, you will become lax - such that even the little you learn will be without depth, joy or even intelligence.",
        "1_, 4_Chapter, 7_Paragraph": "And know this rule: Just like it is impossible for someone blind in both eyes to see and for a donkey to think - so too is is impossible for a lad without a yoke to have alacrity and get up early, or for a young man without obligations to himself to be industrious and exacting. And you must already know the reason for this thing yourself. The powers of the spirit in the lax person are dozing; they require someone to move and arouse them, to move them forward to do their work. So the yoke upon you to finish an amount of work like this arouses, awakens and pushes them to their work. And once your capabilities are exerting themselves in their work, they will go deeper and search in depth. This however is not the case with someone who has no yoke and obligation to a quantity of work. Without something arousing and pushing it, the spirit doses off and does not exert itself, such that your study will be weak quantitatively and poor qualitatively - with neither depth nor profundity.",

        "1_, 5_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "Note that even though we will not itemize all the illnesses of the soul and their remedies in this book, like a peddler with his wares - nevertheless just like we spoke about the illnesses of laziness and laxness because they are so central and someone struck by them is unable to take the first step in the world of divine service; so too must we speak about the sickness of individualism here. For it is a hopeless illness; and one struck by it, God forbid, descends to the pit. And to our sorrow, it has spread a great deal today among those lads and young men who lack sense and have hearts of stone. Every such lad or young man thinks of himself as an independent self - he knows how to act and he knows what is good and bad for himself. So there are times when the teacher or the father will tell him something and guide him, yet it appears in the eyes of such a student that he knows better. And because of that, he looks at his teacher as a tyrant who is coming to force him to do something just because that's what [the teacher] wants. So the heart of the student is distanced from his rabbi through this, to the point that all of his words, Torah and guidance will not [convince the student that the rabbi seeks his good]. So if the student does not hasten to expel this bad trait from his heart - to destroy it completely from within him, to the point that nothing of it is left - his end will be bitter, God forbid: There is no hope for such a boy and no good virtue will come from him. And even the good things and good character traits planted into the hearts of all Jews will become corrupted, twisted and rotten in him; they will all turn to evil, God forbid. From [only] his own sense, he will actually learn the opposite [of what is intended], to call the bad, good; and the good, bad. He will use his traits for the bad - what we need to love, he will hate; and those things that we need to distance, he will love and bring close. Also about him does the prophet lament (Isaiah 5:2), \"he hoped it would yield good grapes; instead, it yielded bad grapes.\" The mind of a Jew and the good traits planted in him as a Jewish young man and that God had hoped would become good grapes - he made into bad grapes. Everything is corrupted and becomes poisonous grapes and bitter clusters. ",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "This illness is a type of pride. And our holy ones, may their memory be blessed, already foresaw this for us and said (Sotah 49b), \"In the time before the messiah, brazenness will grow.\" In earlier generations, students felt submissiveness and self-negation in front of their goodly parents, rabbis and guides. They themselves recognized that that they were small-minded and that they were not equipped for the great work dependent upon them - to guide and develop themselves into the greats of Israel - on their own. And like a man lost in the forest at night when someone comes to guide him and extract him from the terrible darkness of the forest and bring him to an inhabited place - so was their rabbi in their eyes. They loved him and blessed him, and every thought that came out of his mouth was holy - they would absorb it and internalize it into their spirits and hearts. This is no longer the case, when a lad will [instead] be haughty and say, \"I am enough for myself; my mind is good and straight and I can rely upon it. So I will go in my own path.\"",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Good lads and young men, please judge for yourselves - you have begun to internalize our words up to this point, in which we have made you understand what a Jewish young man [actually] is, how God is inseparably connected to him and the yoke that he must bear in developing His holy people - please tell me, is there any greater grief than the grief from these prideful ones; is there any blemish like their blemish? Jewish young men, we do not need to warn you about this terrible character trait. We are certain that the words of God - \"A man must fear his mother and father\" (Leviticus 19:3); and \"The fear of your teacher should be like the fear of the Heavens\" (Avot 4:12) - are engraved upon your hearts. You know quite well that it is God who is teaching you Torah; and that the voice of God is encased in the voice and words of your rabbi when he speaks to you about matters of Torah, divine service and even about proper behavior according to the Torah. And the fear and joy, the fright and the terror that the people of Israel experienced at the time they were at Mount Sinai and heard the voice of God in flames of fire - some of that is also with you now when you are in the yeshiva: When you remind yourselves that the room in which you are in now is full of angels and seraphim and that God's voice comes out from among them, encased in the voice of your rabbi entering your ears and your heart - fright and joy, fear and love shake your body and roil your heart, and you humble yourselves to the Torah of our God heard in the words of your rabbi.",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "You I need not warn about this bad trait. But know that the Mishnah says (Avot 4:4), \"Be very, very lowly.\" One has to distance pride from oneself more than any of the other bad character traits, so that not even a trace of it remain. (<i>Editor's note from the written edition: As is known from the Rambam's Eight Chapters.</i>) Hence perhaps there is a student among you who, while he is not affected so much by pride that he opposes his rabbis and parents, still has a bit of pride internally. He does not humble himself in his heart or admire and value them or their words. So even if he has the ability to overcome the evil pride in himself, since it is faint - and even if he listens to them and overcomes himself enough to do what they command - since he nevertheless has a strong sense of selfhood and rock-hard independence, he also needs to be laundered and washed until his heart and spirit are totally cleansed from the traces of this pride. And not only that. Even someone who is prideful towards his friends - whether because his intellect is sharper than theirs or whether he has no reason and is just proud - is also being clawed, together with his spirit, by his evil impulse. A young man like this - please listen to our words: Rise up quickly, be strong and expunge it if you care about your spirit. Wash and cleanse it if you don't want to go bad, God forbid, all the days of your life forever. ",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "And truly why should dear friends be haughty towards one another? Why not recognize yourselves and your friends as pure angels - the hosts of God - whom he has sent to this world, to conquer it for His sake? See that the God of the heavens and earth is called the Lord of hosts - meaning the Lord of armies. And what armies does the Holy One, blessed be He, have in this world? Channah hinted to this in her prayer (that used this name of God). And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 31b) that with this name, she intended to say, \"Master of the world, from all of the many armies You have created in Your world, is it difficult in Your eyes to give me one child?\" We can already see everything from this.",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "You, Jewish lads and young men, are the hosts and armies of the Holy One, blessed be He; and Channah requested one child from these hosts. You are pure of spirit in front of Him like His angels on high. You shall conquer the world for His sake and crown Him, may He be blessed, upon it. Not with the sword or the spear, but rather with the spirit of God within you. You shall raise up a treasured and holy nation from yourselves; through you, His light will shine and the world will be sanctified with His holiness. So why should you be haughty and push one heart away from the other, when you are also pushing God away with this? And God has already said about the proud person, \"He and I are not able to dwell together, it is as if he is pushing away My feet\" (Sotah 5a).",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 7_Paragraph": "Pure-hearted student, you must love one another! Be careful about the words of the Mishnah (Avot 4:12), \"Let the honor of your friend be beloved to you like your own.\" And your love for one another should not be forced - like one who only loves himself, but since he is warned and commanded to also love his fellow, forces himself not to hate him. It is like one who takes a tiny part of his love for himself and offers it as a voluntary sacrifice to his fellow. Such love is nothing even when it exists, and will quickly dissipate and melt away.

You must serve with all of your strength and Your God of hosts will raise and make each one of you great, both spiritually and physically - according to the level of his service and the level of his humility. And how many times have we been shown lads with great abilities who remained insignificant because they became haughty. Moreover, even regarding a great man who already merited to be a Torah scholar, the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Eruvin 54a), \"If he becomes arrogant, the Holy One, blessed be He, brings him down.\" And how many lads have we seen who were not noteworthy as children, but became the glory of Israel as adults!",

Just the opposite, our intention is only to refine you so that you will be able to look into them and absorb their holy words into your spirit and body, and that all of your limbs will be watered from the spring that comes out from the house of God and from His holy chambers. Hence we do not quote all of the words of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, the Shulchan Arukh and the other holy books regarding proper behavior. For they are accessible; and anyone - whose spirit desires to be close to the One who is pure and to be found among His servants and His pure tzaddikim - may learn from them. Instead, we are just quoting that which is relevant to our subject.",
        "1_, 6_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "In Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chaim 1, it is stated, \"One should not be embarrassed in front of other people who mock him in his service to God, may He be blessed.\" This embarrassment is a large boulder in the bulwark of the plague. For such a man is not even following his own opinion and authority, but rather dragged and pulled along by other people. He is afraid that this mocker will mock him. And for that reason, he negates himself to that one's opinion. He will only do according to what is good in [the mocker's] eyes. [In this way,] he will be prevented from doing good things, since it is possible that another neighbor will laugh at him for it. And he will also need to adjust himself to find favor in the eyes of a third person and a fourth person. Woe is to such a person, who has given over his spirit and his body to the authority and opinion of other inconsequential people. They all rule over him, whereas he has no power over his own flesh and bones. This embarrassment in front of those that mock one is an ugly illness, and its beginning and foundation is childishness and smallness: When a child is small, he knows that he does not have his own [developed] intellect. So he gets used to measuring all of his affairs according to the customs and opinions of the adults surrounding him - \"If I do this, I will be good in their eyes; but if I do the other, they will laugh at me, etc.\" [In this case,] this approach remained with him when he grew up and got older - to pay more attention to what is nice in the eyes of others than to what is actually good.",
        "1_, 6_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Jewish young man, please listen to this principle about this matter, and more generally: If you do not exert yourself and redouble your efforts with all of your strength to remove and take out from the roots every bad character trait and immaturity from your childhood, they will remain with you forever and cause you damage. If your evil impulse seduces you, by saying, \"Why should you work and fix yourself; you are still a lad and that is why your shortcomings are like this; so when you grow up in years, they will end automatically and your mind and your traits will be strengthened on their own\" - mercy upon you, do not listen to him! For only the years got older, not the man. As there are adults - even seniors with regards to their years - who are lads or even children in their opinions and their personalities. And this is all because they were negligent in their service and depended on their years [to change them].",
        "1_, 6_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "Let us now return to our topic, to investigate how this illness of false shame remains in a man from his childhood, and how one can be cured from it: Because at the beginning of a child's intellectual development, he does not have his own [developed] intellect to differentiate between good and bad, nor an internal drive to push him by saying, \"Do this and that, but do not do the other\" - he needs to absorb ideas from the outside. For he does not know what to do on his own, without measuring it according to the opinions of the adults as to what is good and bad in their eyes. And if when he grows older, he still does not acquire his own intellect or personal drive, the opinion of other people will not budge from within him and it will be the only thing that controls him. He will even bend to their stupidities and be embarrassed [to disagree with such] opinions, so they will not mock him. All of his actions will only be to impress other people. And please note this wonder; that there are people that are suffering from both of these opposing plagues - from insignificance and lack of independent thought, as well as from the haughtiness and individualism that we spoke about in Chapter 6. They are haughty against their goodly rabbis and teachers. But their haughtiness is to say, \"I am my own person and I have a clear opinion to think that I should negate myself to the opinion of the corrupt [outside] world and to be dragged behind it, like sheep are brought to slaughter.\" You good young men should laugh at them and at their twisted and corrupt opinion - to have the pride and individualism to make oneself into a floor rag, to negate oneself and become corrupted! ",
        "1_, 6_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "It is this way - to have haughtiness with corrupt lowliness - because even the haughtiness did not sprout from within. For it is impossible for such a cursed and rotten haughtiness - the foundation of which is a spark of idolatry, God forbid, and the effect of which is to destroy  what remains of the nation of God after Nebuzaradan, Nero and Titus - to rise up from within a Jewish spirit. It is an illness all over the world right now. And since he has no independent opinion but rather bends to the world, even such rot contaminates him - such that he rebels against his rabbis and father. ",

For even the one who is embarrassed from the mockers and bends to their opinions has an intellect. And they have already grown up and become adults. However all their opinions are not from themselves, but rather from the [outside] world. A child who wants to imitate an adult wears a hat and the coat of an adult and will be a laughing stock in everyone's eyes. But these people have been crafty to know better how to imitate the actions of the world without anybody laughing at them. But one is like the other, since they both follow the way of a monkey - for all of a monkey's wisdom is just how to make his actions conform to the actions of a man. If people in the world say that good is bad, they will do like them - to disparage the Torah and its students. And if they will go crazy and become amazed by a children's game with a ball, he will also humble himself to it and bend himself to its ridiculousness. So we want to open up your own opinion in you. Is not your essence that of a Jew, such that you should reveal the the spirit of Israel inside of yourself? Let the spirit of the forefathers that is stored within you come out and grow. It will move you and it will make you say, \"Do this and that; serve God, your God and the God of Israel; observe His commandments; listen to His voice in the mouth of your goodly father and rabbi; mock the ones that are far from the Torah; be solid in matters of Torah; be bold like a leopard; and be not afraid of, or embarrassed by, anyone!\"",

However this too is the will of God now at this time, that we compromise a little. You have already studied Torah. Now you should study a craft or business.\" And they will even have the temerity to use our holy words and say, \"Even the Mishnah says (Avot 2:2), \"It is good for the Torah to be with the way of the world (<i>derekh eretz</i>, usually understood as work).\" And they will even seduce you to compromise about divine service by saying, \"The times have changed and we no longer need to be so particular about all of the commandments and Jewish practices, and keep so much distance from murkiness, as we did in the past\" - and that which is similar to this.

        "1_, 7_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Advanced student, I am concerned that you have been startled by my words here. Up until now, you thought that the improvement that we demanded of you up before and about which we said that you are not free and exempted was only [regarding] how to cleanse your character traits and how to remove the poisonous dust that we just mentioned - and that this would be enough for you to do, in order to climb to the level of being a true Jewish adult - and that you understood us. But this is no longer the case, since even after the cleansing and improvement of bad traits, we are still demanding that you elevate yourself and come closer [to God]. We are demanding that you elevate yourself very much - such that your whole being approaches God. Yet that is something [optional] in your eyes; something that only the most spiritual people and the great tzaddikim need to make efforts towards reaching, whereas every other simple Jew is exempt. [But] you have made a big mistake. It is true that the closeness [to God] and elevation of the souls of the great tzaddikim is much greater than that of the simple Jew. Yet even every simple Jew - however he may be - it is almost impossible for him to be a Jewish servant of God with a dry heart and an old and hidden spirit. Hence he must raise himself - at least sometimes - above himself and above the whole world. Our teacher, Moses, said to the Israelites (Deuteronomy 4:35), \"You have been shown, to know that the Lord is God; there is none else beside him.\" He did not say this to his generation alone. For the Torah is eternal and our teacher, Moses, is our eternal leader. So even now is he announcing and making it known to all Jewish hearts and spirits, \"You have been shown, to know that the Lord is God; there is none else beside him.\" It is not enough for us to have the knowledge that God, may He be blessed, is found above, outside of us. Rather, you have been shown to know - what is central is that you sense and feel Him, may He be blessed. And you, advanced student, have already been shown a little bit to know this. And if you will not sense the Divine Presence of His glory in front of your eyes like the prophets and the great tzaddikim - our teacher, Moses, already hinted to us [what to do when he said] (Deuteronomy 4:39), \"And you shall know this day, and you shall set it to your heart, that the Lord, He is God, in the heavens above and on the earth below; there is none else.\" \"And you shall set it to your heart\" - so set it to your heart, and know that \"the Lord, He is God, etc.\" For please note the nature of your trembling in your heart for God and your yearning for Torah, the commandments and true prayer. And why is it that when you think about how great it would be for me if I could be a great tzaddik that is close to God, like the tzaddikim of earlier days; and how happy I would be if I could make my prayers like those of the Maggid of Kozhnitz, may his memory be blessed for life in the world to come, and I would be unified with God in great purity through them - your heart trembles so much and your entire body quakes from this yearning that is like a torchfire inside of you? From where does all of this come to you, if not from that which your spirit is struck by being in front of the Master, the Lord of hosts? It is for Him that you yearn and melt. \"And you shall know this day, and you shall set it to your heart, that the Lord, He is God\" - when you set [the matter] to your heart, then you will know that the Lord, He is God!",
        "1_, 7_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "However our teacher, Moses, did not only say, \"And you shall know [...] that the Lord, He is God, in the heavens.\" He also said, \"on the earth below; there is none else.\" And that is central - to see and know that also below on the earth, there is none besides God and His holiness, may He be blessed. But how can a person say that if, God forbid, there is a foreign god in his heart? For the Gemara says (Shabbat 105b), \"What is the strange god that is within a person’s body? Say that it is the evil inclination.\" And how can a person say, \"I am a Jew and I serve God,\" if he also worships, mutatis mutandis, the strange god inside him, listens to it and does its will, God forbid. How can he approach God, and say, \"Blessed are You Lord, our God\"; be in front of God and say, \"Lord, You are our God\" - when he has, mutatis mutandis, a strange god nesting in his heart, to which he, God forbid, subjugates himself.",
        "1_, 7_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "This is the crux - that you expel the strange god and the evil impulse from inside you. We are not asking of you to completely expel it all at once, that you should wake up and be completely pure from any stain or illness. That is impossible. Rather that you regardless begin this divine service of yours and give it all of your efforts. There is a [relevant] parable: To what is this similar? To a king, whose enemy snuck in and settled into the king's palace. If the palace minister exerts himself with all of his strength to expel the enemy, the king will neither get angry nor ignore him. He will help him further his campaign - in each room and step of the palace from which the enemy is repulsed, the king will hasten to come and dwell there. But if the minister is negligent and does not attack or fight - and especially if the king feels that he is secretly making peace with the enemy and listening to him - his anger will burn like fire. He will be furious and curse him, saying, \"Swindler and traitor, you have given over my domicile to my enemy. How dare you also trick me and say to me, 'You are my king and I serve you.'\" You certainly understand the analogy on your own. Your body and soul are a palace of the Ein Sof, and He dwells in them. However the enemy of the King - the strange god and the evil impulse - snuck in and nested inside of you. And how great will be the anger of the King of the world when He says that not only have you - the minister of the palace -allowed the enemy and the strange god to dwell inside you, you have even made peace with it, subjugate yourself and obey it? He will be furious and call you a swindler and a traitor - \"How can you also trick Me and say to Me, 'Blessed are You Lord, our God?'\" Therefore please start now to cleanse your character traits and thoughts, so that they not be like a slime pit. Please work with all of your strength to sanctify them and crown God upon them, such that you should only do, speak and even think according to His words and commandments.",
        "1_, 7_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "And behold that the entire ability of the Jew to expel the evil from inside himself, to change himself from bad to good and to rejuvenate himself comes from the free will that God has given to us. The beasts and animals are compelled in their deeds, thoughts and in everything that pertains to them. God gave free will to man so that he can choose the path of life or, God forbid, the opposite. And like a merciful Father, He requests from each one of us to \"choose life, in order that you should live\" (Deuteronomy 30:19). But a person who wants to [truly] choose one of two paths must be above and beyond them. The Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 22:6) says, \"Fortunate is the man who is above his transgressions. Woe to the man whose transgressions are above him.\" Can a drunkard decide to choose the good and make his mind to no longer get drunk, when he is still drunk? The mind of the one choosing is confounded with the wine, and his spirit is confused by it. With what will a man overcome to choose the holy path, if his essence is the essence of the animal spirit that sinks downwards, his intellect is full of the biases of his evil impulse and he understands the bad to be good, and the good to be bad? Hence a person is required - at least occasionally - to be above his transgressions, his evil impulse, his biases and the whole world. And at the moment of such elevation and purity, he will see and feel in himself that he is a Jew that is close to God; and that his childish deeds, his silliness, his evil impulse and its inclinations are a snake and a viper. So he will be embarrassed and afraid on his own and say, \"Oy, how contemptible and disgusting I am with all of these [bad] character traits and this lowly silliness that are with me! Oy, how can can I cut off myself - and the root of my ancestors, the Jewish soul within me - from the Source of Life and Holiness, and fling myself into a nest of snake and vipers, a place of rot and death, God forbid?\" His entire being will [then] shake, and his entire being will tremble. He will redouble his efforts with all of his strength and shake off his spirit and body from the slime and the snakes that are wrapped around him. He will overcome and choose a life of purity and Godly holiness from now on. And do you not - Jewish young man - also feel this on the day that you study with consistency and pray with concentration, according to your ability, and at times when you approach holiness a little: You are embarrassed about your silliness and it seems polluted in your eyes, and then it becomes easier to control yourself and to straighten your entire being. And this is what we said to you, that raising yourself up is not [an optional matter] that is only for the great tzaddikim. Rather everyone - according to his situation - is required to elevate his entire being, at least periodically from time to time."
