        "2_Bereshit, 14_Paragraph": "... In every generation, the scholars (of that generation) are making up [alternative translation: are finishing, or filling up] the Torah, because the Torah is being interpreted in every generations according to the needs of that generation And according to the source of their souls - so is God enlightening the eyes of the wise people of that generation, in Its holy Torah. (Translation by Abby Stein)", 
        "34_Behar, 0_Paragraph": "<b>For you are resident strangers  with Me</b> It is possible to speak about this in the manner of allusion. I will explain it according to what I have heard from a certain wise person regarding the verse \"I am only a stranger in the land; do not hide Your commandments from me.\" (Psalms 119:19). This is known from the quality of the nature of the world; a stranger is without a people to cleave to, they are without one to be close to and to tell all their happenings and all their heart to, since they have no friend neither Jew nor Gentile. But when the stranger sees a friend, then they tell all of these to their friend, all their happenings. And know that the Holy Blessed One is Themself like a stranger in this world(!) for They have no-one with whom to imbue Their presence and Their glory, may They be blessed, and we are infinitesimally small, etc. And this is what King David, peace be upon him, prayed: \"I am a stranger in this land\" (ibid.) -- this is to say, I too do not want to be resident in this world(!) And I am only like a stranger in this world. And therefore, do not hide from me Your mitzvot -- like a stranger who tells all their heart to their friend. And this is that which can be said about the allusion in the verse \"For [you are] resident strangers\", that you are in the aspect of a stranger in this world, and in that of a resident in the world to come. Then you are with Me, for I also am a stranger in this world (as explained above) and obviously, I will not hide from them My mitzvot (as explained above, and understand).", 
        "8_Vayetzei, 11_Paragraph": "She said \"Elokim has gathered my shame\" and she called his name Joseph saying \"YHVH will add for me another son.\" First, we need to understand that she said G-d gathered etc... Then afterwards, she called him by a different name: that he is Joseph (will add). She should have called him Asaf (gathered). It is known that here it is different from the rest of the names where it was first written next to each one \"she said he has judged me etc... and she called his name Dan (judged). Thus it is for all of the rest. In the specific case of this name, that she called him Joseph, it completely contradicts and is entirely the opposite of what was originally intended. That he would be Asaf, this is a language of gathering and bringing in, so that there would not be more, but Joseph, this name is a language of addition, that there may be more added. There is something to explain, according to the poverty of my mind, thus: Behold, she had a need to give thanks for what had happened, that HaShem Yisborach did not abandon her in His mercy and gave her a son. Also, she wanted to pray for the future, that YHVH would add for her another son. It is known that the letter Aleph is Yud Vav, that an Aleph is written with Yud, Vav, Yud like this, that it is the figure of Yud Vav. This is the value of this verse: \"she said 'G-d has gathered my shame.'\" She gave thanks for the past. \"She called his name Joseph,\" the reason to say \"YHVH will add for me another son\" is that she needed also to speak and to pray for the future. Thus, she called his name Joseph that this name includes both of them. \"YHVH will add\" is a prayer, according to its simple understanding, and it is also an expression of gratitude for what has already occurred, because Yud Vav is Aleph, as has been explained above, and the letters of Joseph are also the letters of Asaf. Now, we teach about both of them. You should understand this.  "
