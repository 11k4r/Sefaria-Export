        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 3_Paragraph": "Another aspect of the line: ‎וירא וירץ לקראתם‎. ‎A <i>tzaddik</i> is able to judge the character of a person by ‎merely looking at that person’s face. When encountering a ‎wholesome person, he is suddenly filled with light, whereas when ‎he does not feel his features suddenly exuding brightness, this is a ‎warning to him that he is looking at an evil person. In this ‎instance, the Torah prefaces Avraham’s running to meet these ‎men with the words: ‎וישא עיניו וירא‎, “he raised his eyes and saw;” ‎this meant that he felt himself reacting positively to the ‎appearance of these men as soon as he set eyes upon them.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 47_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎17,13., <b>“to be circumcised, etc.:”</b> <small>[what follows is not ‎documented although the author quotes <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i>, ‎‎49. It is not found there, nor in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 47, where it ‎ought to be, if at all.  The author himself appears to have had his ‎doubts, and this is why he attributes the so-called “quote” ‎די לעבד ‏להיות כרבו‎, “it is appropriate for a servant to emulate his master,” ‎to a statement in the <i>Levush</i>. The authenticity of the ‎statement has been questioned as it implies that just as G’d is ‎‎“circumcised,” so His favourite creatures must be. I will content ‎myself with paraphrasing the thoughts of the author. We know ‎that in order to create a physical world, G’d had to “reduce” the ‎impact of His emanations, or to be ‎מצמצם‎, “to understate the ‎extent of His brilliance.” In order for G’d to conclude a covenant ‎with Avraham in his capacity as the founder of the Jewish people, ‎G’d’s “junior” partner on earth, he and the people under his ‎authority had to perform a symbolic act on their body, i.e. the ‎removal of their foreskin. By doing this they emulated an ‎attribute used by their Creator. This explanation may answer the ‎question that if G’d created everything in His universe in a ‎perfect state, (compare Genesis 1,31) why would it be necessary at ‎this stage for Avraham to remove a G’d given part of his body? ‎Ed.]‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 23_Paragraph": "Once we appreciate this we can also understand why in ‎‎<i>parshat Lech lecha</i> prior to Avram being commanded to ‎circumcise himself, G’d promised him that he would father a son ‎from Sarah. (Genesis 17,15-16) This meant that the reward for all ‎the commandments Avraham would perform subsequently would ‎not be offset against accumulated merits in respect of miracles ‎G’d would perform for him. These “miracles” would be viewed as ‎fulfillment of what G’d “owed” him, i.e. promises made but not ‎yet fulfilled.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 32_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎22,12. <b>“He (the angel) said to him: ‘do not touch the lad, ‎and do not harm him in any way;’….for now I know …and you ‎have not withheld your only son from Me.”</b> We need to ‎examine why in this verse the word ‎ממני‎ has been added, as well ‎as why this word is omitted when G’d speaks about the oath He ‎has sworn to Himself in verse 16. Before answering these ‎questions, let us look at <i>Shabbat</i> 63 where the Talmud ‎states that ‎כל העושה מצוה כמאמרה אין מבשרין לו דבר רע‎, “when ‎someone performs one of G’d’s commandments in accordance ‎with its <i>halachot</i>, one (heaven) does not sadden him by ‎informing him of bad news. The Talmud bases this on ‎‎<i>Kohelet</i> 8,5 ‎שומר מצוה לא ידע רע‎, “he who will obey the ‎commandments will know no evil.” The word ‎כמאמרה‎ in the ‎Talmud poses a problem. The Talmud means that both study of ‎Torah and performance of the commandments must be based on ‎one’s desire to carry out G’d’s wishes. If one studies Torah to pass ‎an exam, this is not accounted true Torah study. If one blows the ‎‎<i>shofar</i> on New Year’s day in the synagogue, however ‎expertly, but in order to earn the fee one has been promised, the ‎promise that such people will be spared bad news is not ‎applicable.‎<br>Furthermore, even having performed the <i>mitzvah</i> ‎according to the <i>halachah</i> and exclusively in order to fulfill ‎G’d’s wish, one must not congratulate oneself for having carried ‎out one’s Creator’s wishes and have pleased him. If one thinks ‎along these lines, one’s performance of the commandment will ‎not please the Lord.‎<br>It is related in <i>Chagigah</i> 15 that it happened once that ‎Rabbi Yoshua ben Chananyah (one of the leading scholars in his ‎time) was standing on one of the steps leading up to the Temple ‎Mount, <small>[the Temple had already been destroyed, but the Mount ‎had not yet been levelled by the Romans, Ed.]</small> when he saw ben ‎Zoma in front of him, and the latter did not rise in ‎acknowledgment of the presence of his teacher. Rabbi Yoshua ‎asked ben Zoma what subject he was so deeply immersed in that ‎he had not noticed the presence of his teacher. The latter replied: ‎‎“I was contemplating the significance of the difference between ‎the “upper waters,” and the “lower waters,” (Genesis 1,7) and he ‎had discovered that the distance between them was only three ‎fingers’ breadth.” He claimed that the proof was founding Genesis ‎‎1,2 where the spirit of the Lord is described as hovering above the ‎surface of the waters.” He considered the word ‎מרחפת‎‎, used by ‎the Torah there as describing the act of “hovering” as a reference ‎to a pigeon hovering above its young without touching them. ‎Upon hearing this, Rabbi Yoshua commented to his other ‎students: “ben Zoma is still on the outside.” He meant that ben ‎Zoma had not yet become privy to hidden aspects of the Torah. <small>‎‎[The reader will note that ben Zoma, in spite of sayings of his ‎being quoted in the tractate Avot, is never referred to as “Rabbi.” ‎Ed.]</small><br>We learn from this passage that even if a person performs ‎the commandments in a manner which affords G’d satisfaction as ‎the worshipper had reduced himself to negating earthly concerns, ‎this does not automatically mean that he has attained the level of ‎awe of the Creator that would overcome him when he enters the ‎palace of a King. He may have attained the awe that a visitor to ‎the King’s palace experienced when entering the vestibule of the ‎palace, but not the awe that overcomes people who enter the ‎inner sanctum of the palace. The closer the visitor approaches ‎the presence of the king, the more profoundly will he be ‎impressed with the aura of glory and power surrounding his ‎majesty. Recognition of this obligates him to prostrate himself, ‎this act being an expression of his being aware how totally ‎inadequate anything that he had done to honour his king really ‎was.", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 35_Paragraph": "Avram’s deeds, the ten tests G’d subjected him to, all of which ‎he passed with flying colours, became the foundation stone of the ‎Jewish people. Had it not been for this, the Jewish people would ‎not have been witnesses to the ten plagues with which Gd smote ‎the Egyptians, nor would they have qualified for G’d personally ‎addressing them when He gave the Ten Commandments. This ‎assured Avraham his place as the founding father in the hierarchy ‎of the Jewish people, and therefore as a participant in the Exodus ‎from Egypt. In His answer to the question of ‎במה אדע כי אירשנה‎, ‎‎“How will I know that I will inherit it,” G’d assures him that he ‎will be no less entitled to a share in the Holy Land than the ‎people who physically marched out of Egypt in Moses’ ‎time.’’<br>G’d entertaining the thought that there would develop a ‎Jewish nation, and that this nation would proclaim Him as their ‎G’d, etc., would result in generating the necessary response in the ‎form of a deed in producing the required souls, ‎נשמות‎. This ‎‎“thought” is expressed in the first two letters of Avram’s name ‎אב‎. ‎When G’d had that thought about a Jewish nation, He referred to ‎Avraham as ‎אב‎, not to Terach. A son’s claim to life in the world ‎after death is based on the spiritual merits possessed by his father. ‎Something similar occurs when the mother entertains the ‎appropriate thoughts at the time of marital union with her husband. ‎Such thoughts influence the baby to be born from that union, either ‎positively or negatively. By telling Avram details about how his ‎descendants would develop into a people, G’d also implied that ‎contrary to what Avram might have hoped, his father <small>[at that time ‎still very much alive. Ed.]</small> would not be part of that chain. <small>[When ‎we speak of Terach, Avram’s father in the <i>Haggadah shel</i> ‎Pessach every <i>Seder</i> night, the author has drawn a dividing ‎line between Terach and Avraham. Ed.]‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 10_Paragraph": "An alternate meaning to this line when understood in ‎conjunction with the first word of the next verse, i.e. ‎וזה‎: Noach ‎is told to construct the ark in a way that it be fit for the ‎‎<i>Shechinah</i>, presence of the Lord. He may have told Noach ‎that by using the right words, he could construct the ark by ‎merely uttering the correct formula. Using the correct words ‎would also ensure that G’d would “feel at home” inside and ‎around the ark. The dual meaning of the word ‎תיבה‎, would bring ‎home to Noach that he was in effect using words to ensure the ‎survival of man and the earth, i.e. G’d’s handiwork. ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 17_Paragraph": "Our sages in <i>Yuma</i> 28 express this thought when they ‎said that Avraham kept all the commandments of the Torah ‎down to the minutest detail such as ‎ערובי תבשילין‎, a rabbinic ‎ordinance enabling us to cook and bake on the festival in ‎preparation for the Sabbath on the next day, something ‎ordinarily forbidden as it appears as if one used a holy day to ‎prepare for the mundane day following, by having made ‎appropriate preparation for the observance of this very festival ‎on the eve of the festival in question by having prepared basic ‎meals for it. To the question how one could “fulfill” ‎commandments of the Torah at a time when the Torah had not ‎been revealed yet, the answer is that when man endeavours ‎through intense mental concentration to divine what is pleasing ‎to his Creator, he can tune in to the appropriate “wavelength.” ‎Avraham was the first individual who succeeded in doing this. ‎Avraham had succeed in placing all his 248 limbs at G’d’s disposal, ‎so that he was inspired with divining the will of his ‎Creator.<br><small>[Once the Torah had been given this feat could not be ‎repeated, just as the <i>akeydah</i>, Avraham’s offering his son as ‎a sacrifice to G’d in response to G’d’s request, could not ever be ‎repeated. Ed.]‎</small><br>According to tradition each of our limbs has a ‎function to perform for the 248 positive commandments of the ‎Torah. In fact, unless these limbs were used to perform G’d’s ‎commandments, they have no claim to life on this earth (or at ‎least in the Land of Israel). In a descending order, the head fulfils ‎the commandment of wearing <i>tefillin</i>. As long as Avram did ‎not live in the Holy Land, he had not had an opportunity to fulfill ‎any of these ‎מצות‎, “as yet unrevealed commandments,” as there ‎would be many commandments that could not be fulfilled even ‎after the Torah had been given, since they are not inextricably ‎tied to the soil of Land of Israel. He was therefore “missing” a ‎considerable number of limbs in his body, limbs that could not ‎perform their real tasks until he had settled in the Holy ‎Land.<br>Avraham was aware of this; this is why he had served ‎the Lord by the first method that we described earlier, i.e. by ‎selfless devotion to G’d, negating any claim to the comforts life on ‎this earth affords the creature living it, serving Him exclusively ‎from the ‎אין‎ aspect of the universe. This helps explain why he ‎allowed himself to be thrown into a fiery furnace by Nimrod in ‎order to demonstrate his utter devotion to the Creator. Once he ‎moved to the Holy Land, there was no more need for him to ‎demonstrate his loyalty to G’d by such negation of his entire ‎body.<br>If the reader were to ask that Yitzchok’s being offered as ‎a potential sacrifice to G’d occurred in the Holy Land, something ‎that does not appear to conform to the principle just described, ‎the answer is quite simple. Yitzchok’s being offered as a sacrifice ‎was the fulfillment of an express command by G’d, whereas G’d ‎had never told Avram to put his life on the line in his theological ‎confrontation with Nimrod. <small>[In fact some commentators, ‎especially Rabbi Yitzchak Arama in his <i>Akeydat Yitzchok</i>, are ‎extremely critical of Avraham for having done what he did ‎without express permission from G’d. Ed.]</small> <br>Since Avraham’s ‎service to the Lord was based on his attachment to the ‎אין‎, the ‎purely metaphysical domains of the universe, it is clear that he ‎could not draw down some of G’d’s largesse to the earth, the ‎domain of the ‎יש‎, the primarily physical, material domain of the ‎universe.", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 42_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎15,14.‎‎, <b>“and also the nation ‎whom they will serve I shall judge;”</b> many commentators were ‎stymied by the connective letter ‎ו‎ at the beginning of the word ‎וגם‎. What does this letter connect to? <small>[Compare <i>Or ‎Hachayim</i> my translation pages 141-143. Ed.]</small><br>It seems to ‎me that Avram viewed the fate of his ancestors during this period ‎as being subjected to 400 years of the rule of the attribute of ‎Justice, as is evident from his reaction to this prediction with a ‎dark sense of foreboding. (see 15,12) G’d assures him that He ‎would not single out Avram’s descendants for the rule of the ‎attribute of Justice, but that the nation that enslaved his ‎descendants would experience retribution also, and in the end the ‎Jewish people would recognize this period with its deprivations as ‎having ultimately been of benefit for them.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 8_Paragraph": "A great and powerful king once invited one of his loyal servants to accompany him to his treasure ‎chamber where he displayed a store of jewels and other valuable artifacts. The servant was ‎overjoyed at the king having taken him into his confidence by showing him all his valuable ‎treasures. He became proud to be a servant to such a powerful king. Upon reflecting on this ‎however, he suddenly was overcome with trembling when thinking about what a great wrong it ‎would be to disregard even a minor paragraph in the law books the king had issued to his subjects ‎to live by. The psalmist’s words reflect a similar dilemma. How can one at one and the same time ‎be in awe and full of joy? The Talmud <i>B’rachot</i> 30, tries to answer this apparent ‎contradiction by understanding the latter half of the verse as: “when in a place where merriment is ‎the rule, do not forget that it behooves you to be trembling, seeing that you are always in the ‎presence of the Lord.” Abbaye, who, when in an extraordinarily happy frame of mind, was ‎reminded of this by a colleague, responded that as long he was wearing the phylacteries on his ‎head, this served him as a reminder not to forget this injunction.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 11_Paragraph": "<b>‎G’d called the light: ‘day;’\"</b> <i>Bereshit</i> <i>Rabbah</i> 3,8 comments that this phrase refers to ‎the deeds of the righteous, whereas the line ‎ולחושך קרא לילה‎,  is understood as referring to the ‎deeds of the wicked. In order to make it plain that the Creator preferred the deeds of the ‎righteous, the Torah added the adjective ‎כי טוב‎, “that it was good,” when defining the word ‎אור‎ in ‎verse 4.‎‎<br>The average reader of this <i>Midrash</i> surely is puzzled by the fact that there was any doubt as ‎to whose deeds the Creator would prefer so that the Torah had to indicate that G’d preferred the ‎deeds of the righteous! Rabbeinu Yonah, in his commentary on the last <i>Mishnah</i> in ‎‎<i>B’rachot</i> chapter 9, explains that the <i>Mishnah</i>, when referring to the need to serve ‎the Lord with both parts of our hearts, the urge to do good as well as the urge to do evil, speaks of ‎people who do serve the Lord. The <i>Midrash</i> quoted, was careful to refer to the deeds of ‎the wicked as opposed to the wicked themselves, also does so. We may therefore understand the ‎‎<i>Midrash</i> as also referring to good deeds, the origin of which, however, differs. The ‎difference between the two “urges” is that the urge to do evil is by definition the result of anger ‎and hatred, whereas the deeds that are prompted by the urge to do good, are by definition ‎prompted by feelings of goodwill and love. No wonder that G’d prefers the positive deeds that are ‎also the result of constructive attitudes, to the good deeds that are the result of the urge to do ‎evil, even when both deeds may be identical. This idea has been portrayed by Proverbs 3,17 where ‎Solomon has described the ways of Torah as being ‎דרכיה דרכי נועם‎, “her ways are ways of ‎pleasantness;” in other words, it is not only what you do that counts but how you go about doing ‎it.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 7_Paragraph": "Going back to the line: ‎את האלוקים התהלך נח‎, “Noach ‎walked with G’d;” the emphasis in this line is on the ‎attribute for G’d used, i.e. ‎אלוקים‎, the attribute of Justice. It was ‎beyond Noach’s kind of <i>tzidkut</i>, righteousness, to turn the ‎attribute of Justice into an attribute of Mercy through his ‎lifestyle. In this respect he was different from Avraham and ‎Yitzchok, concerning both of whom the Torah writes that they ‎‎“walked before G’d,” not merely “with G’d.” (Compare Genesis ‎‎17,1 and 48,15) In those verses the Torah wished to alert us to ‎the patriarchs’ ability to persuade G’d to substitute the attribute ‎of Mercy for the attribute of Justice, on occasion. ", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 10_Paragraph": "Genesis 26,3. <small>(some editions of the <i>Kedushat ‎Levi</i> do not contain this paragraph)</small> sojourn in this ‎land…..for to you and to your descendants I will give this land ‎‎.as a result of Avraham having hearkened to My voice, etc.” ‎This verse sounds at first glance as if Yitzchok on his own ‎account did not have the merits required for him to stake a claim ‎to this land in his own right.‎<br>It is known (in Kabbalistic circles) that Avraham constantly ‎endeavoured to restore the “sparks” that had escaped from the ‎‎<i>Shechinah</i> in the celestial regions, and that seeing that these ‎were to be found among the gentiles, this necessitated that he ‎visit countries other than the land of Canaan. Once he had ‎gathered them up, Yitzchok could begin to spiritually elevate ‎them. It would no longer be necessary for Yitzchok to leave the ‎Holy Land in order to search for any remaining “sparks,” that had ‎escaped the <i>“Shechinah”</i> and become tainted by contact ‎with the material world and its allures. This is what is alluded to ‎when the Torah speaks of ‎תולדות יצחק‎, “Yitzchok’s ‎accomplishments,” instead of ‎תולדות אברהם‎, “Avraham’s ‎accomplishments,” as Avraham did not have the merits of his ‎father to assist him in his task on earth. As a result of this lack of ‎זכות אבות‎, he had to sojourn in other countries on occasion.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 9_Paragraph": "והנה רבקה יוצאת אשר ילדה לבתואל‎, “and behold, here ‎Rivkah who had been born for Betuel was coming forth.” She ‎had been born for Betuel, due to beneficial, though indirect, ‎input by Avraham. Betuel was not the originator of Rivkah, but ‎merely a vessel used by G’d as an intermediary. <small>[There is no other ‎verse in the Bible where the expression ‎אשר ילדה‎, “who she bore,” ‎is not connected to the mother who bore that child. Ed.]</small> The ‎Torah alludes to Avraham’s role in that “birth” by using the ‎vowel <i>kubutz</i>, which implies “external influence.” The ‎reason why Eliezer immediately gave Rivkah jewelry even before ‎enquiring who she was, shows that he realized that her attribute ‎of ‎חסד‎ had revealed that she had much in common with his ‎master Avraham, and that there must be a biological link between ‎her and Avraham. This is also what <i>Rashi</i> had in mind when ‎he wrote: (verse 23) “after he had given her the bracelets, because ‎he was certain of his master Avraham’s merits.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 8_Paragraph": "This brings me to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 49,4 where we are ‎told that it was Avraham’s custom after having served his guests ‎a meal to ask them to give thanks to the Creator of the universe. ‎Why did Avraham not ask them to pronounce a benediction ‎before they commenced eating, as is customary among Jews, and ‎even among many gentiles? The reason may be that before eating ‎these people were pagans, and how could they pronounce a ‎blessing that implied that they had accepted the yoke of serving ‎the one and only Creator? Having eaten, they had performed a ‎commandment through conferring upon their host Avraham the ‎merit of fulfilling the duty to be hospitable; having done so, they ‎themselves had been given a merit by dint of having contributed ‎to Avraham’s merits, so that now when they pronounced a ‎blessing thanking the Lord Who provides food for all of His ‎creatures, they were not mouthing empty phrases. This is why ‎the Midrash continues by relating that if Avraham’s guests would ‎refuse to recite a blessing to the Lord, he would demand that they ‎return to him what they had eaten, etc, etc. The embarrassment ‎caused the guest when he realized that he had partaken of what ‎had not been intended for him, would usually cause the guest to ‎reconsider. Avraham had explained to the guest that unless they ‎provided him with the merit of having performed the ‎commandment of being hospitable, they would in fact have ‎robbed him of something that was his.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 15_Paragraph": "The author offers another way of understanding the verse ‎אלה תולדות השמים והארץ בהבראם וגו‎', ‎and the verse following,‎וכל שיח השדה טרם יהיה בארץ וכל עשב השדה טרם יצמח ואדם אין בו וגגגו‎', ‎‎“when no shrub of the field was yet on earth and no grasses of the field had yet sprouted, etc.;” ‎he draws our attention to Genesis 38,27:‎ויהי בעת לדתה ויתן יד ותקח המילדת ותקשור על ידו  שני ‏ויהי כמשיב ידו וגו' ואחר כך יצא אחיו ותאמר מה פרצת עליך  פרץ וגו‎', “when the time came for her to ‎give birth, there were twins; while she was in labor one of them put out his hand and the midwife ‎tied a crimson thread on that hand to signify “this one came out first;” but just then he drew back ‎his hand  and out came his brother;  the midwife said: ‘what a breach you have made for yourself” ‎This one was called ‎פרץ‎, “breach,” whereas his brother was named ‎זרח‎, “brightness.”‎<br>Nachmanides, in his commentary on the Torah, writes concerning this occurrence, quoting Rabbi ‎Nechunya ben hakaneh, that the name ‎פרץ‎ is a euphemism for the moon, whereas the name ‎זרח‎ ‎is a euphemism for the sun.<br> <small>‎‎[Rabbi Nechunyah ben hakaneh was a scholar of the second generation of the authors of the ‎‎<i>Mishnah</i> and the famous kabbalistic text known as <i>sefer habahir,</i> has been ‎attributed to him. Ed.] </small>‎<br>Our author (as distinct from Nachmanides) understands the description of the Torah of this ‎unusual birth as illustrating how the various universes at any given moment receive positive input ‎from the Creator, and that when a human being wishes to secure additional ‎שפע‎, Divine beneficial ‎outpouring, or input, for the world in which he lives, he must attach himself to the domain we ‎described as ‎אין‎, i.e. the disembodied spiritual domains of the universe, i.e. to the domains in ‎which G’d did not have to surround Himself with screens in order to avoid blinding His creatures ‎with His brightness. When he has done so, G’d, in turn will respond by showering more of His ‎goodness upon His creatures in the various domains of the universe. In the verse under discussion, ‎the Torah describes a period when this interaction between man and G’d had not yet taken place, ‎i.e. nothing had grown forth as yet from earth that would have such a positive influence triggering ‎further beneficial input originating from the heavenly spheres. This state of the universe, prior to ‎such interaction is what our verse speaks about when writing ‎טרם יצמח‎, “had not yet sprouted,” ‎and similar expressions. The words ‎יצמח‎ and ‎המטיר‎, “sprouting and raining”, respectively, are ‎similes for the reciprocal positive input from the heavens to the earth and from the earth in the ‎direction of the celestial regions. The period under discussion in our verse precedes the time when ‎the Creator garbed Himself in shells that reduced the brightness of His emanations, so that His ‎creatures instead of being burnt up, could “warm” themselves, spiritually.‎<br>The opportunities, i.e. precise moments in time, when G’d responds to man attempting to cleave ‎to Him with his soul, are fleeting moments during which people doing this must perform a ‎מצוה‎, ‎such as giving charity or studying Torah, as a result of which G’d will provide additional ‎שפע‎, divine ‎bounty from above to below. If that moment has passed and not been taken advantage of, G’d ‎withdraws to the region of ‎סוד‎, “hidden” domains where He is only partially within reach of the ‎creatures who wish to establish intimate contact with Him. The words: ‎ואדם אין לעבוד‎, may be ‎understood allegorically as: “there being as yet no human being who would yearn for a close ‎relationship with His Creator.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 22_Paragraph": "Another approach to Malki Tzedek’s blessing. There are ‎problems <small>[i.e. obstacles erected by Satan’s involvement in our ‎region of the universe, Ed,]</small> in this “lower” part of the universe ‎that most people are able to deal with on their own if they really ‎put their mind to it. There are other problems that man, without ‎direct help from G’d, cannot deal with irrespective of how well ‎intentioned and capable he is. In such instances, when warranted, ‎G’d has to “kill,” i.e. neutralize the obstacles facing deserving ‎individuals. When Avram, representing “loving Kindness,” killed ‎the four kings who had defeated the Kings of Sodom and his allies, ‎he did so by garbing himself in a halo of heroism, appearing to be ‎a powerful warrior, since he was engaged in battling pagan forces, ‎active deniers of the concept of monotheism. By engaging in such ‎a battle, he acted against all his natural instincts, on behalf of a ‎higher ideal.<br>Malki Tzedek praised G’d, the Supreme G’d, Who ‎had enabled Avram to prevail over his oppressor against what ‎must have seemed like impossible odds. Although G’d owns the ‎whole universe, on this occasion He had allowed or enabled ‎Avram to assume powers that normally are reserved for the ‎Supreme G’d, exclusively. It was clear to Malki Tzedek that Avram ‎on his own could never have achieved such a stunning victory ‎unless G’d had actively intervened on his behalf.<br>As soon as ‎Avram had completed his victory, after having temporarily set ‎aside his natural tendency of relating to all phenomena in the ‎universe only with loving kindness, he was given G’d’s promise ‎that he would sire a son, who in due course would personify this ‎virtue of ‎גבורה‎ that Avraham had been able to acquire when he ‎thought that the situation demanded it. Until Avram had ‎demonstrated this ability to garb himself in ‎גבורה‎, the conditions ‎had not been ripe for him to sire a son such as Yitzchok. Up until ‎now, had Avram sired a Yitzchok, his son’s major characteristic ‎would have been the opposite of that of his father. This, in due ‎course, would have resulted in an estrangement between father ‎and son. Now that Avram had learned to appreciate the value and ‎necessitude of this personality trait, the conditions had been ‎created for father and son to coexist harmoniously.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 34_Paragraph": "Everything that has been handed down to us about Avram ‎suggests that he was unwavering in his faith in G’d from his very ‎youth, and certainly did not have any theological relapses. ‎Nachmanides stated with absolute certainty, basing himself on ‎Genesis 25,8 that Avram had always considered anything that ‎happened to him as being G’d’s desire and meant for his own ‎good. Nachmanides understood this as being the meaning of the ‎words: ‎זקן ושבע ימים‎, “of old age, satisfied and satisfied in years.” ‎Contrary to most people, who are described in <i>Kohelet ‎Rabbah</i>, 5,9 as leaving behind many unfulfilled aspirations ‎when they die, Avraham died fully fulfilled. In <i>Baba Batra</i> ‎‎117, as well as in <i>Sanhedrin</i> 91 the meaning of the word ‎מורשה‎ is discussed, there being different opinions of how the ‎distribution of the ancestral plots in the Land of Israel was ‎determined by lottery; if the lottery only applied to the tribal ‎allocations, or to families. The discussion also concerns whether ‎only Jews who partook in the Exodus or their offspring were ‎allocated land, or whether the allocation included Jews who had ‎lived before that period, including Avram, Yitzchok, etc. Avram’s ‎question of ‎במה אדע כי אירשנה‎, meant: “how will I know that I ‎personally will be included in the distribution of the land at that ‎time? He knew that he would not inherit a plot of land in Israel as ‎part of his father Terach’s merit, as he had been the first convert ‎to Judaism, something that was confirmed in <i>Sukkah</i> 49. ‎Since he did not endure slavery in Egypt as did the generation of ‎the Exodus, he was not sure that he would qualify at the time of ‎the distribution.<br>Avram’s question had been triggered by G’d ‎saying to him:, ‎לתת לך את הארץ הזאת לרשתה‎, “to give to you this ‎land in order to inherit it.” (15,7) Avram wanted to know if he ‎would live long enough to take part in the distribution of the ‎land in Joshua’s time, or how he was to understand the words: ‎לתת לך‎, “to give to you.” The Talmud in <i>Sukkah</i> 49 quotes ‎psalms 47,10 where we encounter the expression ‎עם אלוקי אברהם‎, ‎‎“the nation that worships the G’d of Avraham”; a sage raised ‎question whether G’d perhaps is not also the G’d of the people of ‎Yitzchok and the G’d of the people of Yaakov.” The answer given ‎is that Avraham was the first convert from which the Jewish ‎people developed, so that he enjoys a special status. As a reward, ‎G’d gave the land of Israel especially to him. Avraham wanted to ‎know if, since the land of Israel becomes a ‎מורשה‎, his share would ‎be due to his father bequeathing it to him. The term ‎ירש‎, “to ‎inherit,” always implies that one inherits from a father. If ‎Avram’s question had been ‎במה אדע כי תתן לי‎, “how will I know ‎that You give it to me,” it would have been inappropriate, of ‎course. G’d had spoken about “giving;” Avram asked only about ‎the hereditary aspect, ‎אירשנה‎.<br>We will deal with the expression ‎במה אדע‎, somewhat later in this paragraph.‎ When G’d introduced His reply to Avram’s question with the ‎words: ‎ידוע תדע כי גר יהיה זרעך‎, “you must truly realize that your ‎descendants will be strangers, etc.,” this can best be understood ‎when referring to a commentary by the <i>Zohar</i> I 87 on the ‎verse: (Genesis 2,4)‎אלה תולדות  השמים והארץ בהבראם ‏‎. The letter ‎ה‎ in ‎smaller script in the middle of this word alerts the reader not to ‎read the word as a single word, but as ‎באברהם ברא‎, i.e. G’d created ‎the universe on account of, or with the eventual assistance of ‎Avraham.” Had G’d not foreseen that someone like Avram will be ‎born, He would not have considered it worth His while to create ‎the human race. The fact that Avraham, on his own, without ‎prompting, would proclaim the name of the Creator, made it ‎worth G’d’s while to put up with all the sins man would commit. ‎Avraham would be the one to acquaint his peers with the concept ‎that G’d is One, is unique, is in charge of the universe and yet had ‎granted the creatures he made in His image freedom of choice to ‎choose their own path in life. The fact that this Avraham would ‎sire a Yitzchok, and Yitzchok in turn would sire a Yaakov who ‎raised 12 sons who would form the nucleus of the Jewish nation, a ‎nation of priests, made it all worthwhile for G’d. When the Jewish ‎people collectively accepted G’d’s Torah, without critically ‎examining what was written therein first, this was a crowning ‎moment not only for the Jewish people, but it enabled G’d to ‎converse with a mortal human being, Moses, as if he were on His ‎own level, i.e. ‎פנים אל פנים‎, face to face.‎<br>When G’d introduced His reply to Avram’s question with the ‎words: ‎ידוע תדע כי גר יהיה זרעך‎, “you must truly realize that your ‎descendants will be strangers, etc.,” this can best be understood ‎when referring to a commentary by the <i>Zohar</i> I 87 on the ‎verse: (Genesis 2,4)‎אלה תולדות  השמים והארץ בהבראם ‏‎.

Ed.]</small> At that ‎time all creatures on earth were in awe of their Creator. When the ‎people had consecrated the Tabernacle in the desert as a “home” ‎for Hashem in the lower parts of the universe, G’d took delight in ‎the world He had created, as we know from <i>Taanit</i> 26 where ‎the Talmud understands Song of Songs 3,11 ‎ביום חתונתו וביום שמחת ‏לבו‎, “on His wedding day, the day when His heart rejoices,” as ‎referring to G’d’s feelings on the day of the revelation at Mount ‎Sinai, and the day when the Tabernacle was consecrated, ‎respectively. This is the kind of ‎נחת רוח‎, “pleasure, satisfaction,” ‎that man in the lower part of the universe can contribute to G’d ‎in the loftier spheres, in heaven. On both of these occasions the ‎joy was reciprocal, G’d showing that He can associate with ‎earthlings and take pleasure from this. The Israelites’ enthusiastic ‎response after the splitting of the sea and their miraculous and ‎escape from Pharaoh’s pursuing armies, was another occasion ‎when the reciprocal nature of the relationship between G’d and ‎His “chosen” people was demonstrated publicly. Nowadays, ‎almost 4000 years later, we recall these events and praise the Lord ‎every week when we pronounce the blessings over wine. Not a ‎day goes by without our giving thanks to the Lord for the Exodus ‎from Egypt‎.<br>At the time when Avram lived, the world, i.e. the planet earth ‎and man on it, was still in a state of semi-collapse, its continued ‎existence far from assured, until Yitzchok and Yaakov continued ‎the work that Avram had started when he kept proclaiming the ‎power and goodness of the Creator. This assurance of the earth’s ‎continued existence was only confirmed with the creation of the ‎Jewish people, and this people’s leaving Egypt as G’d’s people, ‎after having slaughtered the Passover, and proven that they ‎considered the Creator as their highest authority.<br>The <i>Tur</i>, commenting on why we mention the Exodus ‎of Egypt in the weekly <i>Kiddush</i>, as opposed to the ‎‎<i>Kiddush</i> on the festivals whose link to the Exodus is self-‎evident, explains that the Sabbath harbours within it the ‎כח ‏המוליד‎, the power that enables creatures to regenerate themselves ‎by producing offspring. This “power” is conditional on the ‎observance of the Sabbath (in some form). Terach, Avram’s ‎father, while able to produce physical offspring, was unable to ‎produce offspring equipped with the kind of soul that would be ‎active in spreading the message that G’d is the one and only ‎Creator. [I have not been able to find where the <i>Tur</i> writes ‎this, although he writes about man as well as most other living ‎creatures becoming endowed with the ability to procreate bodies ‎in his Torah commentary. (Genesis 2,3) ", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 8_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎12,8. <b>“he built an altar for the Lord Who had appeared to ‎him there.”</b> Why did the Torah have to add the word ‎אליו‎, “to ‎him,” at the end of this verse? Would we not have understood ‎this without being told?<br>I believe that on this occasion G’d ‎promised material blessings, and this is why Avraham felt obliged ‎to build an altar in acknowledgment of this. The word “altar” ‎serves also as a symbol for man’s expressing his desire to come ‎closer to his Creator by means of a material offering. He does so ‎by reciprocating in the only way a human being can reciprocate ‎for receiving a gift from G’d. Accordingly, the word ‎אליו‎ describes ‎an element of reciprocity that occurred here in the relations ‎between man and G’d, his remaining not only at the receiving end ‎of G’d’s largesse. In order to give expression to this aspect of the ‎man-G’d relationship he had to build an altar. Man’s gift to G’d ‎must be brought in a fitting manner, the altar serving as the ‎vessel in which this gift is presented.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 7_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎12,3. <b>“I shall bless those who bless you, and those who ‎curse you I shall curse.”</b> At  first glance it seems strange that ‎the Torah changed the order of subject and object when speaking ‎of anyone who would curse Avraham. Why would people who ‎bless Avraham be given a blessing before they had actually done ‎so? We find here an example of the principle that G’d considers ‎good intentions as part of the carrying out of such intentions, i.e. ‎the party carrying out a noble intention, is retroactively rewarded ‎not only for the deed but also for the thoughts that led up to the ‎deed. When planning something wicked, G’d does not take this ‎into consideration even after the wicked act has been carried out. ‎‎(<i>Kidushin</i> 40.)‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 11_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎6,15 <b>“You are to construct it ‎according to this blueprint.”</b> (The author continues with an ‎approach bordering on the mystical, involving the difference ‎between the words ‎זה‎ and ‎כה‎ when they appear in the Torah. He ‎elaborates on this theme also in <i>Parshat Vaeyrah</i>, on Exodus ‎‎7,16) <br>There are <i>tzaddikim</i> who allow themselves to be guided ‎by letters, i.e. the two letters in the word ‎זה‎ in our instance. ‎Other <i>tzaddikim</i> such as Moses, are far more articulate, and ‎the word ‎זה‎ is merely a prelude for them of the words that follow. ‎‎<i>Sifri</i>, on <i>Mattot</i>, 2, explains this with the following ‎words: although both Moses and other prophets introduced their ‎prophecies or prophetic announcement with the word ‎כה‎, i.e. ‎כה ‏אמר ה'‏‎, “thus said the Lord,” Moses is the only prophet whose ‎pronouncements were sometimes introduced with the word ‎זה‎, ‎i.e. ‎זה הדבר אשר צוה ה'‏‎, “this is the word that the Lord has ‎commanded.” (Numbers 30,2). Moses’ advantage over other ‎prophets, sometimes described as that he received a clearer vision ‎than the other prophets, also consisted in his formulating the ‎prophecy instead of merely repeating what he had seen or heard. ‎In the words of our author, he was ‎מנהיג את הדיבור‎ “formulating ‎the wording.” When G’d said to Noach: ‎זה אשר תעשה אותה‎, “this is ‎how you shall construct it (the ark),” Noach was granted the ‎same level of clear vision as was granted to Moses when we ‎understand the word ‎תיבה‎ as word, ‎דיבור‎ <small>[his reincarnate 800 ‎years later. Ed.]‎‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 18_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎8,21. ‎<b>“He smelled the pleasing odour, ‎etc;”</b> The <i>Baal Haturim</i> mentions that the expression ‎וירח ‏את ריח הניחוח‎, “he smelled a pleasing odour,” occurs only here and ‎when Yitzchok smelled what he thought were Esau’s garments in ‎Genesis 27,27. On the face of it, the comparison appears strange. ‎The Talmud (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 37), throws light on this by ‎suggesting that instead of reading the word ‎בגדיו‎ in Genesis 27,27 ‎we should read it as ‎בוגדיו‎, “its traitors, deviationists,” and the ‎message is that in the future, even such people will please G’d by ‎their actions. In Esau’s case, the deferential manner in which he ‎addressed his father entitled him to be described in such ‎complimentary terms. Noach’s deference before G’d, (when he ‎could have asked G’d embarrassing questions about finding the ‎earth in ruins) elicited this positive response by G’d. G’d Himself ‎testified to this at the end of this verse (acknowledging the fact ‎that man, having been born with an evil urge, was predisposed to ‎do evil), hence, if he nonetheless decides to follow the path of ‎goodness, thereby defeating the evil urge within him, this is a ‎major moral achievement.<br>The author, quoting his father (if I understand correctly) ‎traces the source of this pleasing odour, ‎הניחוח‎, to pleasurable ‎experiences by man on earth, (as opposed to spiritual ‎experiences). If man can sublimate these pleasurable experiences ‎to reinforce him in his service of the Lord, then G’d can truly ‎‎“boast” of him as we read in Isaiah 49,3 ‎ישראל אשר בך אתפאר‎, ‎‎“Israel, I can glory in you.” The author continues by quoting ‎Rabbi Dov Baer of Mezeritch, as tracing the word ‎אתפאר‎, to the ‎word ‎תפר‎, describing the first garments Adam and Chavah made ‎themselves from fig leaves to cover their nudity. (Genesis 3,7) “A ‎pleasant smell” originating from appropriate clothing, is ‎therefore the most ancient method of ingratiating oneself with ‎G’d after one has fallen out of favour. Pleasant smells as a source ‎of pleasure are familiar to us all, and describing G’d’s reactions to ‎man’s good deeds in such terms is not at all far-fetched. “Clothes” ‎has long been a simile for the deeds of people wearing them, ‎whether good or evil; it is therefore appropriate that when the ‎Torah describes these clothes in complimentary terms, i.e. as ‎pleasing, the reference is to the good deeds performed by the ‎people so described.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 10_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎12,9. <b>“Avram journeyed ‘southward’ in stages.”</b> In order to ‎understand the significance of this verse we must remember that ‎the meaning of the word ‎נגב‎, becomes clear from Joshua 15,19, ‎where Calev is reported as giving his daughter Achsah to whom ‎he had given some land in the southern district of Yehudah, an ‎additional source of irrigation in response to her plea; the ‎‎<i>negev</i> was known already then as a semi arid region. The ‎expression: ‎מנוגב‎, taken from the word ‎נגב‎, means “dried out, ‎lacking in moisture.” In fact, ‎נגב‎ is identical with ‎דרום‎, an allusion ‎to G’d’s attribute of ‎חסד‎, loving kindness. When the word ‎נגבה‎ is ‎used in our verse instead of the word ‎דרומה‎, which in common ‎parlance means the same thing, the reason is that the Torah ‎wished to draw the reader’s attention to the blessing inherent in ‎the word ‎נגב‎. Water, though generally perceived as a blessing, a ‎necessity, also has a down side, as we are all aware of. When the ‎word ‎נגב ‏‎ is used for “south,” this implies that water flowing there ‎is an unmitigated blessing. The moisture mixed with the natural ‎characteristic of ‎נגב‎ results in a perfect blend of two elements. ‎The Torah reports here that Avraham understood how to blend ‎service of the Lord with being of service to the people among ‎whom he lived. He knew how to “get out of his skin,” and to ‎spread the generous nature of which he was possessed far and ‎wide. In doing so, he served his Creator with his entire ‎personality. <small>[Some of these words are my own. Ed.]‎</small>",

Ed.]</small> <br>We have a statement in <i>Chagigah</i> 15, according to which there is a heavenly voice calling out ‎once on each day emanating from Mount Sinai calling on sinners to do penitence, excluding only ‎Elisha ben Avuya. The Talmud there illustrates that there exists an opportunity for each one of us ‎to cement our relations with our Creator. All that is needed is to demonstrate one’s sincerity ‎through performance of one of the <i>mitzvot </i>that<i> </i>are basic to Judaism, such as giving ‎charity or Torah study. The reference to ‎שיח‎, a word having several meanings, may be to warn us ‎that we are not to waste our time on earth in idle conversation, if we aspire to establish a firm ‎bond with our Creator. There is no need to add that if one employs the gift of speech to indulge in ‎defamation of others, etc., that this instead of strengthening the bond with our Creator, drives a ‎wedge between Him and us.‎<br>Such abuse of the power of speech is forbidden even when we find ourselves in the part of the ‎universe that has either not yet emerged from the primeval state of ‎חושך‎, darkness, or is on the ‎verge of descending back into that sorry condition.

        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 4_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎18,3. <b>“do not just pass by your servant.”</b> Avraham was ‎overcome with a sense of prophecy as soon as he saw these men. ‎We have a tradition (<i>Rashi, Baba Metzia</i> 114) according to ‎which the prophet Elijah was a priest; and that when Pinchas ‎avenged the insult to G’d (Numbers 25,1-9, 11-15) perpetrated by ‎Zimri and the people at Shittim, his soul linked up with those of ‎Nadav and Avihu (who had been priests) and the letters in the ‎word ‎נא‎ in our verse allude to the first letters in the names ‎נדב, ‏אביהו‎, so that he became henceforth identified with the prophet ‎Elijah, who similarly was jealous on behalf of G’d. The words: ‎תעבור מעל עבדך‎, “pass by your servant,” are an allusion to Elijah’s ‎traditional role of briefly attending every circumcision of a Jewish ‎baby, as a symbol of the importance of that covenant between ‎the Jewish people and G’d.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 16_Paragraph": "Turning to the second half of this verse in which G’d ‎apparently links fulfillment of His promises to Avraham to the ‎latter’s implanting his convictions in their hearts, i.e. ‎למען אשר ‏יצוה את בניו ואת ביתו אחריו‎, “in order that he will command ‎‎(by testament) his sons and household after him, etc.,” how ‎precisely are we to understand this?<br>When a person sincerely ‎believes that G’d derives satisfaction from being given a reason for ‎disbursing some of His largesse on the Jewish people, any blessing ‎requested by an Israelite in his prayers is itself a source of ‎pleasure for G’d, seeing that it reflects the Israelite observing the ‎Torah and its commandments. The words: ‎למען הביא ה' על ‏אברהם‎, “in order that G’d can bring upon Avraham, etc.;” ‎mean that the recipient of these blessings will perceive that ‎Avraham is being rewarded when his offspring receives the ‎blessings, both material and spiritual, from G’d.

He was ‎suddenly possessed of the characteristic (the author has “soul,”) ‎that would distinguish his not yet conceived son, Yitzchok. We ‎explained in the previous paragraph that this resulted in his also ‎being endowed with the attribute ‎תפארת‎, harmony, so that he ‎combined all the three characteristics that distinguished the ‎three patriarchs.",

Seeing that this is a difficult process ‎for us to grasp, the idea that Avraham’s good deeds “spilled over” ‎even to people such as <i>Betuel</i>, is meant to set our mind at ‎rest over the fact that Rivkah, with a father such as Betuel, and a ‎brother such as Lavan, could have been such a righteous ‎matriarch as she clearly was.<br>During the meal, Eliezer recounts ‎what had occurred at the well, and anyone who has read the ‎Torah’s report of what transpired is aware that Eliezer rewrote ‎some of this “history,” i.e. the sequence of events. <i>Rashi</i> ‎points this out (in his commentary on Genesis 24,47) implying ‎that during the meal, in the presence of Betuel, Eliezer could not ‎bring himself to imply that this man had been endowed with part ‎of Avraham’s soul. <small>[Perhaps the fact that if even a Betuel could ‎exclaim that this match had been made in heaven (Genesis 24,50) ‎is the best support for our author’s theory that some of ‎Avraham’s spirit had spilled over even into the soul of a Betuel. ‎Ed.]‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 12_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 18,13. <b>“the Lord said to Avraham: ‘why did Sarah laugh ‎and say…that I am too old?”</b> Our sages in <i>Yevamot</i> 65 ‎point out that in this case G’d, i.e. His angels, deliberately ‎misquoted what Sarah had said, by quoting her as describing ‎herself too old to bear a child, whereas actually, she had ‎described her husband as being too old. The Talmud uses this ‎example to teach that a “white lie” is justified when it serves the ‎purpose of preserving harmonious relations between husband ‎and wife. <br>It is difficult to understand this example as ‎Avraham himself had described himself as being too old to sire a ‎child, when he said: ‎הלבן מאה שנה יולד‎, “is a 100 year old man ‎going to have child born for him?” (Genesis 17,17) Why would it ‎bother him if his wife would merely confirm what he himself had ‎already said? We may have to understand what Sarah said as ‎being slightly different from what is commonly perceived. Sarah’s ‎reaction to the angel’s prophecy <small>[at a time when she was not ‎even aware that he was an angel. Ed.]</small> had referred to the miracle ‎she had just experienced, i.e. ‎אחרי בלותי היתה לי עדנה‎, “after I ‎have stopped having the periods of women, I have suddenly ‎been rejuvenated!” Her comment about her husband’s old age ‎simply meant that as long as she had not observed a similar ‎process of rejuvenation in her husband, how would her own ‎rejuvenation alone contribute to the fulfillment of the prophecy? ‎She may also have meant to imply that if G’d had wanted her to ‎bear a child, why had He waited until after she had become too ‎old for this to happen unless He performed a miracle?‎<br>The subject has been discussed in <i>Yevamot</i> 64 where one ‎answer is that G’d is so anxious for the <i>tzaddikim</i> to pray ‎to Him, that He will wait and delay His timetable, in order to be ‎able to give credit to the <i>tzaddikim</i> who have turned to ‎Him in supplication.‎<br>Sarah being an extremely humble person, never considered ‎herself as being on the level of a <i>tzadeket</i>, a righteous ‎woman, so that it never occurred to her that almighty G’d would ‎feel in need of her prayers of supplication. On the other hand, she ‎was not entitled to think that her outstandingly righteous ‎husband had not seen fit to pray for children, so that when she ‎referred to him as “old,” she meant that in spite of his prayers he ‎had not been granted children, and that by now it was too late for ‎this. If her real words had been reported to Avraham, this would ‎have caused him anguish, so that the Torah, (G’d, i.e. His angel) ‎decided to substitute the word ‎אני‎ for ‎אדוני‎. A person’s humility ‎must not be carried to the extent that he is humble on someone ‎else’s account. This is the reverse of ‘humility,’ and borders on ‎arrogance.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 3_Paragraph": "Still another angle from which to approach the opening line ‎in our <i>Parshah</i> would concentrate on the word ‎הוליד‎, begot, ‎instead of ‎ילד‎ “gave birth,” in the sense of doing more than ‎merely contribute semen. <small>[Compare Genesis 4,18; (three times) ‎‎10,23; 10,24. et al.). Ed.]</small> According to this the Torah used the ‎expression ‎אברהם הוליד‎ to indicate that Avraham’s influence to ‎Yitzchok’s being born extended to the next generation, i.e. he ‎had a share in Yitzchok’s ability to sire children, also. Moreover, ‎Yaakov, as we have stated elsewhere, served G’d under the ‎heading of the emanation ‎תפארת‎, “harmony,” a combination of ‎the two attributes of ‎חסד‎ and ‎גבורה\\יראה‎. Our verse, by ‎commencing with the connective letter ‎ו‎, “and,” suggests that ‎due to Yaakov having been begotten by both Avraham and ‎Yitzchok, he was able to unify the two major characteristics of his ‎father and grandfather within his personality so that he could ‎serve his Creator by using both these attributes to the best ‎advantage, i.e. blending them into ‎תפארת‎, harmony. This ‎influence that Avraham was able to exert on the development of ‎his grandson Yaakov, is described by the Torah’s use of the ‎causative mode of the <i>hiphil</i>, by writing ‎הוליד‎ instead of ‎ילד‎.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 0_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 18,1. <b>“<i>Hashem</i> appeared to him (Avraham) in the ‎groves of Mamre.”</b> Since we have been told that G’d had ‎departed from Avraham in 17,23, we would have expected the ‎verse here to mention the subject Avraham by name. Why does ‎the Torah only write ‎לו‎, “to him?”<br>G’d, i.e. aspects of the ‎אין ‏סוף‎, G’ds Essence, dispensed different amounts of ‎שפע‎, “original ‎light,” eventually converted in the lower domains of the universe ‎into matter of varying degrees of physical densities. Every such ‎שפע‎, represents a distillation, ‎צמצום‎, “shrinkage, of this original ‎light. <small>[If I understood the concept correctly, Ed.]</small> This process is ‎reflected already in the different names we have for G’d, the ‎letters in these names reflecting varying degrees of G’d’s having ‎restricted His manifestations to His creatures in order to make it ‎compatible with what His creature can tolerate.<br>This principle ‎applies not only to creatures in the lower part of the universe, i.e. ‎our planet, but also to the different categories of “angels,” ‎disembodied servants of the Lord in the celestial spheres, ‎according to the spiritual level attained by the creature, angel, or ‎human being, as the case may be. <br>When such a human being ‎has been given a “name” by its Creator, this “name” reflects the ‎degree to which this person is able to absorb G’d’s “light,” ‎without being harmed by it. When a human being serves his ‎Creator out of awe, ‎יראה‎, by totally negating the limitations ‎imposed on a soul while it is constricted by the body it inhabits, it ‎may be considered as having “disrobed,” shed the restrictions his ‎body imposed upon the free, upward, heavenward motion of his ‎soul. When we express this concept in terms of the meaning of ‎the letters in our G’d-given names, this means that we have ‎divested ourselves of our “names.”<br>Avraham, at the time of his ‎life that the Torah speaks about here, had not yet freed himself ‎from the limits imposed upon him (by dint of the letters in his ‎name) prior to his having been circumcised. This state of flux, a ‎temporary situation, in which Avraham found himself at the ‎beginning of this portion, is reflected in the Torah referring to him ‎only by a pronoun, instead of by his full name.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 20_Paragraph": "Genesis 27,33. <b>“he shall also remain blessed.”</b> We ‎need to examine what exactly prompted Yitzchok to say this, ‎seeing that he did give Yaakov another blessing in 28,1-4. Yaakov ‎received the first blessing when he brought his father the meal, ‎and the second one when he set out to flee from his brother Esau, ‎‎(though his father thought he was sending him only to marry ‎one of Lavan’s daughters.) On the surface, the first blessing was ‎the major blessing, whereas the precise meaning of the second ‎blessing was not even spelled out. If the second blessing was the ‎‎“minor” blessing, it must have been meant to apply to Yaakov ‎while he was alive on this earth, concerning himself with success ‎in his undertakings on earth. The effect of his first blessing was ‎meant to be reserved for use in the world to come, or at least on ‎earth, but after the arrival of the messiah.‎<br>In his comments on Zecharyah 14,9 ‎ביום ההוא יהיה ה' אחד ושמו ‏אחד‎, “on that day G’d will be One and His name will be One,” the ‎‎<i>Ari z’al</i> comments that the meaning is not that G’d’s name ‎will undergo changes, but that the meaning of G’d’s name(s) will ‎be clear to all of mankind. G’d’s name ‎י-ה‎ will no longer be an ‎allusion to exile, nor will His name ‎ו-ה‎ be abused by atheists using ‎it for their own purposes. When the time comes when G’d will ‎deal with the “left” side of the emanations judgmentally, ‎neutralizing its influence forever, the two parts of G’d’s name will ‎be on a par with one another as if there were no ‎ה‎ and no ‎ו‎ but ‎two letters ‎י‎. When Yitzchok told Esau, concerning Yaakov’s ‎future, ‎גם ברוך יהיה‎, “he will also remain blessed in the future”, he ‎referred to that future.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 6_Paragraph": "‎<i>Midrash Tanchuma Tazria</i> 5 relates that Turnus Rufus ‎the wicked, engaged in an argument with Rabbi Akiva, ‎concerning whose works are more impressive, G’d’s or Man’s? ‎Rabbi Akiva, sensing a trap, promptly replied that man’s works ‎are more impressive. Turnus Rufus, feeling outwitted, thereupon ‎asked Rabbi Akiva since when “man” was able to create heaven ‎and earth. Surely this was proof that G’d’s works are more ‎impressive! Rabbi Akiva retorted that the subject under dispute ‎did not concern the celestial regions, a domain to which man did ‎not have access, but it dealt with works performed in the ‎terrestrial regions. Thereupon Turnus Rufus questioned why the ‎Jews circumcise themselves. Rabbi Akiva said: “I knew right away ‎that you would raise this question, as in your mind this looks as if ‎we criticize G’d as having made an imperfect creature when He ‎made man, and we are ‘repairing’ G’d’s ‘oversight.’” He added that ‎this was precisely why he had said immediately that man’s works ‎are more significant. Rabbi Akiva then proceeded to show ‎Turnusrufus a freshly baked roll, and some wheat kernels. He ‎pointed to the wheat kernel as an example of G’d’s (nature’s) ‎work, whereas the roll he described as an example of man’s works. ‎He challenged Turnus Rufus to tell him which of the two he ‎preferred. Thereupon, feeling outwitted, Turnus Rufus asked that ‎if G’d did indeed prefer man without a foreskin, why did He equip ‎him with a foreskin in the first place? Thereupon Rabbi Akiva ‎asked, that according to Turnus Rufus argument, why is a baby ‎born with an umbilical cord, which was to be cut off for the baby ‎to start living outside the mother’s womb? If man was born with ‎a foreskin, this was in order to enable his father, or himself, to ‎circumcise himself and thus fulfill a commandment by His ‎Creator.‎<br>From Rabbi Akiva’s answer to Turnus Rufus we learn why ‎Avraham had waited for the commandment to circumcise ‎himself, seeing that this is a commandment that can be fulfilled ‎only once in a lifetime, the foreskin not growing back. It is a ‎greater credit for man to perform G’d’s commandments when ‎having been told to do so, than to merely do so because one ‎assumes that this is what the Creator would want him to do. <small>‎‎[Compare <i>Baba Kamma</i> 38 Ed.]‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 11_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎18,8. <b>“He remained standing next to them while they ‎ate.”</b> We have a rule that the host should not visibly display ‎physical satisfaction greater than that enjoyed by his guests. The ‎reason for this rule is to avoid causing the guest to become ‎jealous of the host. A <i>tzaddik</i> is also known as a ‎מהלך‎, “a ‎person constantly on an upward spiritual move,” <small>[compare ‎Zecharyah 3,7. Ed.]</small> Angels, by comparison, are considered ‎עומד‎, ‎‎“standing still,” not ascending in a spiritual sense (as they do not ‎have an evil urge to overcome). Avraham was anxious that his ‎guests, the angels, should not become jealous of him; this is why ‎he made a point of standing still.‎",

According to <i>Baal haturim</i>, the words “as ‎we have not harmed you,” are to be understood as an admission ‎by Avimelech that he had indeed intended to harm Yitzchok, but ‎that he had been prevented from doing so by Yitzchok’s G’d. ‎Avimelech now pleaded with Yitzchok to respond to their deeds ‎and not to their evil intentions. He implied that if Yitzchok were ‎planning to do him and his country harm, this too would ‎backfire.", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 25_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎15,1. <b>“After these events the word of G’d came to Avram ‎in a vision- and said to him: ‘do not be afraid,’ etc. and he ‎built an altar there to the G’d Who had appeared to ‎him.</b><br><small>[At this point the author claims to quote a ‎commentary of Nachmanides on the words “he built an alter ‎there,” where Nachmanides questions why Avram built an altar ‎on this occasion, and not on a previous occasion. I have been ‎unable to find such a commentary by Nachmanides. The nearest ‎thing to it is a super-commentary by <i>Sifssey Chachamim</i> on ‎‎<i>Rashi</i> Genesis 12,8 where he raises such a question. I will ‎nevertheless present the author’s commentary, in which he deals ‎with this problem supposedly raised by Nachmanides. Ed.]</small><br>In ‎answering the question of why, until this time, Avram had not ‎built an altar, we must first explain the concepts of “altar” and ‎‎“sacrificial offering.” When a person experiences something ‎painful, be it physical or mental, he is not free to focus on the ‎actual pain, but must focus on the causes of his having to endure ‎such pain, and why on account of this pain his ability to serve his ‎Creator had become impaired. When he reacts to his pain in this ‎manner he causes G’d satisfaction, ‎נחת רוח‎. Keeping this in mind ‎we can understand the Talmud <i>Yerushalmi, B’rachot</i>, 2,4 ‎stating that the messiah was “born” on the 9th day of Av, the day ‎that the Temple was destroyed. This was because the Jewish ‎people felt such pain over the loss of the Temple, and their ‎inability to serve G’d there by offering their sacrifices. As long as ‎the Temple had been standing, G’d was able to derive satisfaction, ‎נחת רוח‎, from the offerings presented on the altar in the Temple. ‎We know this from Leviticus 1,13 ‎אשה ריח ניחוח לה'‏‎, ”an offering ‎by fire of pleasing odour to the Lord.” This offering represented ‎the opposite of ‎צער‎, painful feelings. As long as the Temple was ‎standing, the people of Israel dwelled in relative calm and safety. ‎The principal cause of Israel’s state of disquiet, pain, unrest, etc., ‎is the fact that we are not able to perform the sacrificial sacrifices ‎by means of which we could give “pleasure” to the Creator. As a ‎corollary to our inability, while in exile, to present these ‎offerings, G’d in turn is not encouraged to release the bounty of ‎goodness He has in store for His faithful servants on earth. We ‎have pointed out previously that with the advent of Avram, this ‎reciprocal relationship between man and G’d had become of great ‎benefit to man. (Compare page 51 on this interaction).‎‎<br>Ideally, our joy in this world as well as our pain, must ‎always focus on our relationship with our Creator and how we ‎can improve it; we must never consider our personal feelings as ‎being of the essence. “Joy” in the eyes of the Torah, has not been ‎granted in order for us to behave as do gentiles when they set off ‎‎“fireworks” to give expression to their feeling happy about ‎something.<br>It is worthwhile to remember that the Hebrew ‎word for “sacrifice” is ‎קרבן‎, from the root ‎קרב‎, to come close, or ‎closer. When offering a “sacrifice,” to the Creator, we are ‎sublimating something mundane, usually something representing ‎some of the most treasured living creatures, animals which serve ‎as our livelihood, to the Creator Who had endowed the terrestrial ‎part of the universe with such creatures for the benefit of the ‎highest ranking living beings on earth, the ones who have been ‎created in the image of their Creator.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 31_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎15,1. <b>“do not fear, Avram, I will be your shield.”</b> G’d ‎reassures Avram that He is aware that when he took revenge on ‎the four kings and their armies this was an act of self-defense, as ‎they had planned to harm him. G’d had protected him so that ‎they could not carry out their evil designs. He had killed these ‎kings and their soldiers. G’d had done so because He loved Avram ‎and He would continue to act as his shield, but not from feelings ‎of revenge against them, but because of His love for him, so that ‎Avram would not have any of his merits and the reward due him ‎deducted from his credit balance in heaven, on account of G’d ‎having come to assistance.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 26_Paragraph": "<b>\"And Noach found favour in the Lord’s eyes.”</b> If a person finds favour in the eyes of the Lord, then ‎he becomes a ‎נח‎, i.e. the word being derived from ‎מנוחה‎, rest, G’d being at rest concerning such a ‎person. When we speak of G’d being ‎מגן אברהם‎, “the shield of Avraham,” this reflects a reaction ‎by G’d to Avraham who personifies the virtue of ‎חסד‎, loving kindness, so that G’d protects, ‎מגן‎, ‎such a person. Similarly if we speak of ‎מגן דוד‎, “shield of David;” seeing that David personifies the ‎attribute of ‎מלכות‎, “Royalty” in Jewish history, G’d will act as the shield of David or his ‎descendants, as the title “king” cannot be applied to a person who does not have a people to rule ‎over. G’d must therefore be a shield for the King’s people, if He approves of the King.‎<br>This idea is reflected in the <i>Midrash </i>on Genesis<i> 2,2 </i>‎ויכל אלוקים ביום השביעי‎, “on the ‎seventh day G’d concluded His work.“ He did so because the Sabbath symbolizes Royalty as is ‎evident from the writings of the Ari’zal.<br> <small>‎[According to Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 18, the fact that G’d is not described as either ‎‎“creating” the seventh day, or “performing any work” on the seventh day, and we do not find the ‎phrase: ‎ויהי ערב ויהי בוקר יום שביעי‎, “it was evening, it was morning, the seventh day,” in ‎connection with this day, this is significant. G’d used the seventh day to survey earth and especially ‎the crown of creation, man, whom He had made on the sixth day. He entertained great hopes for ‎man, and indirectly for Himself, when man would choose to serve Him. He used the Sabbath as a ‎King reviews his army, man being equivalent to G’d’s “army” on earth, He being the Commander-‎in-Chief. Ed.] </small>‎<br>A completely different approach to the phrase ‎ונח מצא חן בעיני ה‎': when the <i>tzaddik,</i> ‎righteous person, finds something that appeals to him, he endeavours to use it or part of it, to ‎enhance his service of the Creator. When he sees a person enthusiastically preparing to commit a ‎sin, he reflects that he should be equally if not even more enthusiastic in his service of the Lord, ‎i.e. he uses even negative phenomena to sublimate them and use them positively, constructively. ‎The Torah in Genesis 6,2-reported on the elite of mankind, ‎בני אלו-הים‎ selecting ‎בנות האדם‎, ‎morally inferior women, as their mates, showing thereby that they considered these women as ‎possessing ‎חן‎, “charm, grace,” possessing desirable qualities. The Torah testifies that Noach ‎resisted such attractions, though he had found them. He willed himself to be attracted to G’d ‎instead, exhorting His qualities, instead of the shallow qualities exuded by the ‎בנות האדם‎.  ‎ ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 10_Paragraph": "We need to explain the absence of ‎the expression: ‎ויעש להם משתה‎, “he made a festive meal for them.” ‎We find such an expression even when Lot served the angels a ‎meager meal (Genesis 19,3) consisting primarily of unleavened ‎bread of indeterminate age. We also find it when Esther prepared ‎a sumptuous meal for her husband King Ahasverus (Esther 4,4, as ‎well as 7,8) to which she had invited the wicked Haman, also. In ‎that instance, it is clear that quantities of wine were served, ‎hence the word ‎משתה‎, which suggests liquid refreshments. ‎<br>We have a rule that when a righteous person shares a meal ‎with a wicked person, the wicked person’s spiritual status will ‎become enhanced thereby. This is the moral justification for the ‎joy at such a meal. During such a meal the <i>tzaddik</i> is able to ‎elevate the sparks of the <i>Shechinah</i> which had descended ‎into the terrestrial domains as a result of man succumbing to the ‎seduction of the serpent. <small>[Compare what we wrote on page 21-‎‎22.Ed.]</small> The word ‎משתה‎ is basically a variant of the word ‎שמחה‎, ‎joy, so that when Lot offered the angels a meal which the Torah ‎described as ‎משתה‎, it was not a reference to the number of ‎courses served, but to the atmosphere that prevailed during that ‎meal. In that instance it was Lot’s moral status that became ‎elevated due to the company of celestial beings at his table. As a ‎result of the angels having eaten at his table, (and their having ‎rescued him from Sodom) the soul of the messiah, that had lain ‎dormant within Lot, was awakened somewhat so that he could ‎become the father of a child whose descendant, Ruth, eventually ‎became the ancestor of David, who in turn is the ancestor of the ‎messiah. The joy generated at the meal Esther served the King ‎and Haman, resulted in the salvation of the Jewish people at her ‎time, due to her having elevated some of the sparks of the ‎Shechinah that had lain dormant within her husband. Since ‎Avraham was on a far higher moral/ethical level than either Lot ‎or Ahasversus, there was no need for a ‎משתה‎ to bring the ‎participants’ spiritual qualities to the fore. Hence there is no ‎mention of this word, although Avraham had spared not effort to ‎make it a tasty repast.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 1_Paragraph": "An additional lesson to be derived from this unique verse in ‎the Torah, is that seeing that during all her years she cleaved to ‎the Holy name of <i>Hashem</i>, ‎י-ה-ו-ה‎, this fact is hinted at when ‎the Torah summarizes her life her by commencing with a word ‎containing these letters of G’d’s name. She was conscious at all ‎times that her life depended on that attribute of G’d and not, G’d ‎forbid, on the side of the emanations known popularly as the ‎‎<i>sitra achara</i>, “the left side.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 1_Paragraph": "This was portrayed in the passage at the beginning of <i>Tikkuney Hazohar</i> (based on ‎‎<i>Zohar</i> <i>chadash</i> 59,<i> </i>column<i> </i>3<i>) </i>where the prophet Elijah ‎appeared to Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai and his son Eleazar in the cave where they were in hiding ‎from the Romans and Elijah<i> </i>planted a carob tree and provided a well of spring water from ‎which the two men ate and drank during the 12 years they spent in hiding. Elijah would visit them ‎twice daily and teach them, enabling them to escape prosecution by the Romans. Among the ‎lessons Elijah taught them was the fact that in order to make use of G’d’s input into the physical ‎parts of the universe, G’d had to “clothe Himself,” i.e. conceal His essence, by restricting the ‎holiness He radiated, or this would have been too overwhelming for the recipients thereof. <i>Ari ‎zal</i>, sums this up<i> as: </i>“all parts of the universe require that G’d’s essence reduces its ‎natural radiations, as all creatures in varying degrees are unable to withstand the brilliance of the ‎emanations from G’d’s essence unless they had first been screened to some extent.” According to ‎the <i>Ari</i> zal, any part of any universe, by definition contains a degree of substance, as ‎opposed to G’d, Who is entirely abstract, spiritual. According to this view even the purest and ‎holiest thought entertained by a living creature contains an element of physicality, since only G’d ‎can be pure spirit.‎<br>It follows that before G’d could undertake the creation of a physical universe He had to surround ‎His essence with “garments” shielding His creatures from this overwhelming spiritual radiance ‎emanating from Him. In order to achieve this, G’d “clothed” Himself in garments radiating light. If I ‎understand this correctly, the closer G’d came to the eventual physical world, the more subdued ‎was the brilliance exuded from His “garments,” which He changed from stage to stage so as to ‎enable the creatures in each world to tolerate it without coming to harm through being blinded.‎ <br>All of these “worlds” (regions inhabited by spiritual beings of varying degrees of holiness) are ‎extremely bright, Isaiah 58,11 referring to them as ‎והשביע בצחצחות נפשך‎ “He will satiate your soul ‎with brightness.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 5_Paragraph": "Another way of interpreting the line ‎ויעתר יצחק וגו'‏‎, sees it ‎as Yitzchok imploring G’d to grant his wife children on account of ‎her merits, i.e. ‎לנוכח אשתו‎. He did not think that he himself had ‎accumulated sufficient merits to pray to G’d to consider his own ‎merits. This also appears to be the way <i>Rashi</i> understands ‎the somewhat unusual wording used in our verse when he sees in ‎the word ‎לו‎ “to him,” proof that G’d hearkened only to Yitzchok’s ‎prayer and not ‎לה‎, not to Rivkah’s prayer. Were this not so, the ‎word ‎לו‎ would have been unnecessary, according to <i>Rashi</i>. ‎The reason given by <i>Rashi</i> is that the prayer of a ‎‎<i>tzaddik</i> who is himself the son of a <i>tzaddik</i> reaches ‎G’d’s throne more quickly than the prayer of a <i>tzaddik</i> ‎‎(such as Rivkah) who does not have any parental merit to ‎support her prayers. From the wording of <i>Rashi</i> it seems ‎that, as we said, Yitzchok’s prayer was based on Rivkah possessing ‎the merits necessary for G’d to grant requests in her prayer. If G’d ‎had done what Yitzchok asked because of his reasoning, it would ‎leave the impression that Yitzchok’s own merits were ‎insufficient. In order to prevent the reader from arriving at such ‎an erroneous conclusion, the Torah adds the word ‎לו‎, i.e. that G’d ‎did indeed respond to Yitzchok’s plea, based on his own merit.. ‎The reason that Yitzchok’s plea took precedence was not that he ‎possessed more merits than his wife, but that he was fortunate ‎in having had a father Avraham who himself was a <i>tzaddik</i>. <small>‎‎[This editor wonders why, during the 20 years Yitzchok had been ‎married to Rivkah, his father Avraham never prayed to G’d to ‎grant that couple children. Ed.]‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 33_Paragraph": "When we examine the meaning of the word ‎מצוה‎, ‎commonly translated as “commandment,” this is quite ‎inadequate, as the deeper meaning of the word is derived from ‎צוותא‎, a word describing companionship. In other words, the ‎performance of a ‎מצוה‎ is meant to establish a degree of ‎companionship between man and his G’d. When the Talmud ‎‎<i>Shabbat</i> 63 had stated that anyone who performs a ‎commandment, ‎כמאמרה‎, “in the true sense of its meaning,” will ‎be spared disagreeable news, it is this “companionship” with G’d ‎achieved by the performance of the commandment that the ‎Talmud refers to.<br>There are commandments, the performance ‎of which does not afford the person performing it the slightest ‎physical satisfaction. To mention just a few examples: putting on ‎phylacteries, attaching the fringes, <i>tzitzit</i>, to a four-‎cornered garment; on the other hand, there are commandments ‎the performance of which entails pleasurable sensations, such as ‎consuming three meals on the Sabbath, or <i>Kiddush</i>, reciting ‎the benediction over wine and drinking same. The awareness of ‎the expense involved in order to perform these commandments ‎represents a major aspect in an ordinary individual’s ‎מצוה‎ ‎performance, it contributes to the feeling that he has done ‎something “for G’d.” As long as such considerations are part of ‎one’s ‎מצוה‎ performance, one has not attained the level of ‎מצוה‎ ‎performance described in the Talmud as ‎כמאמרה‎, “in the full sense ‎of its meaning.” When we keep this in mind we can understand ‎the nuances in verses 12 and verse 16 in which G’d compliments ‎Avraham. When G’d commands: ‎אל תשלח ידך אל הנער...כי עתה ‏ידעתי...ולא חשכת את בנך ממני‎, He compliments Avraham for not ‎having had any selfish thoughts when offering Yitzchok as an ‎offering, it had been done totally ‎לשם שמים‎, for the sake of ‎heaven, i.e. Avraham had not withheld anything personal from ‎G’d, by feeling he had done something for G’d. This had been ‎performance of a ‎מצוה כמאמרה‎ in the parlance of the Talmud ‎‎<i>Shabbat</i> 63.<br>Now, that this part of the ‎עקדה‎, was over, ‎and G’d saw that even after Avraham had been spared the need to ‎go through with what he had thought, he did not react with ‎relief but continued to endeavour to perform the commandment ‎in a different way, he had shown G’d that he had been motivated ‎not only by love for G’d, but by totally unselfish awe of Him; ‎there was therefore no need for the Torah to repeat the word ‎ממני‎, “from Me.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 6_Paragraph": "Applied to the allegory in the <i>Mishnah</i> in <i>Chagigah</i> ‎that we quoted, an addiction to the delights of this transient ‎world, when compared to an addiction to serving the eternal ‎Creator is like placing a tainted vessel inside one that is not ‎tainted, hoping to purify it by immersing only the outer vessel in ‎a ritual bath. Keeping the waters of the ritual bath “at arm’s ‎length,” is simply not good enough to cleanse oneself from the ‎pollutants absorbed through contact with the defilements of the ‎earthly environment. The inner vessel had lost some of the ‎brightness with which it had been endowed as a result of G’d’s ‎original light having shone upon it before it became ‎contaminated through contact with the sinner.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 20_Paragraph": "The “decision” to grant man whatever he requests from G’d, ‎or not, is known as the ‎דעת המכריע‎, “The consummate wisdom of ‎the supreme decision Maker.” The alternate method of arriving at ‎the decision to grant the requests of individuals, i.e. to consider ‎the overall interests of all those affected by such decisions as ‎paramount, is known as ‎דעת המתפשט‎, “the consummate wisdom of ‎the One Who takes into consideration the interests of all parties ‎affected”.<br>Avraham was under the impression that even ‎though it had been decided by G’d to grant him children, he could ‎still continue to worship G’d from the premise of the ‎אין‎, ‎considerations involving only the metaphysical parts of the ‎universe. This is why he said that his servant Eliezer would be his ‎heir, i.e. that he personally could remain completely detached ‎from earthly concerns. G’d therefore corrected him, telling him ‎that such a detachment would not be possible, as he would have ‎biological issue, <small>[implying that he could not opt out of the duty ‎to raise a son in a material universe. Ed.] </small>This is the meaning of ‎the line (15,4) ‎והנה דבר ה' אליו לאמור לא יירשך זה כי אם אשר יצא ‏ממעיך הוא יירשך‎, “and here the word of G’d came to him, ‎saying: ‘this one will not inherit you, but someone emerging ‎from your entrails will inherit you.’” The introductory words ‎in this verse inform Avram that the decision concerning this has ‎already been made in heaven, though its implementation is not ‎yet due. According to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 43,7 there is a ‎disagreement between Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman and the other ‎sages, concerning the meaning of the verse ‎ומלכי צדק מלך שלם ‏הוציא לחם ויין והוא כהן לא-ל עליון‎; according to Rabbi Shmuel bar ‎Nachman, Malki Tzedek revealed to Avram the deeper meaning of ‎the office of High Priest. It was the method of serving the Lord by ‎using the method of ‎מסירת נפש‎, the total negation of the self in ‎exchange for attachment to the ‎אין‎, totally metaphysical aspects ‎of the universe.<br>According to the other sages, he revealed to ‎Avram the more mystical aspects of the Torah, i.e. how to serve ‎the Lord by means of performing the commandments designed to ‎be performed by different parts of our body.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 0_Paragraph": "<b> The first thing G’d embarked on when creating the material universe was to create heaven and ‎earth.”</b> <br>It is an axiom, general principle, that G’d created the entire universe, and having done so, ‎never withdraws from the universe for even a single moment, <small>[unlike sculptors or painters who, ‎once they have completed a sculpture or painting, move on to something else, having “finished” ‎with their previous “creation.” Ed.]</small> This axiom is true both of what He created in the heavens and ‎what He created in the material, three-dimensional part of the universe. We pay tribute to this in ‎our daily prayers when we say ‎יוצר אור ובורא חושך‎, “He creates and fashions (present tense) light, ‎and He creates darkness.” When speaking of any accomplishments of G’d’s creatures however, we ‎speak of them in the past tense, i.e.‎יצר כסא‎, “he shaped a chair,” or ‎עשה מזרון‎, “he made a ‎mattress.” G’d’s creative activity is never completed, as the Torah testified in Genesis 2,3 ‎אשר ברא ‏אלוקים לעשות‎, “which the Lord has created in order to complete it.” This means that G’d is part of ‎every creature He ever created, and once man realizes that he is nothing without G’d Who has ‎created him and Who provides him with all the strength and creative stimuli that he possesses, he ‎will be able to relate to <i>Hashem</i> as an ongoing creative Force in His universe. This is ‎reflected every morning when we get up [after having used the washroom] and we refer to G’d ‎with the words ‎אשר יצר את האדם בחכמה‎, “Who has fashioned man with ‎חכמה‎,” the word ‎חכמה‎ ‎meaning the opposite of ‎אין‎, “nothing.” It is appropriate therefore that in that prayer we refer to ‎the creation of man in the past tense, as opposed to the line we quoted earlier, seeing that we ‎refer to something or somebody who already exists, i.e. ‎יש‎. This explains why the <i>Ari </i>z’al , ‎Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, said that when we refer to G’d as ‎ה' מלך‎, usually translated as “<i>Hashem ‎‎</i>is<i> </i>King,<i>” </i>the reference is to the ‎אין‎, “nothing,” i.e. G’d at any given moment ‎gives us life, -by not withdrawing it from us.- The implied meaning of the expression is that man is ‎‎“nothing” unless he continues to exist as part of G’d’s creative activity. The so-called ‎אין‎, “nothing,” ‎in terms of metaphysical beings, rules supreme in the regions beyond those that are part of the ‎physical universe, the one that we conveniently refer to as “nature.” This so-called ‎אין‎, is not really ‎a “nothing,” in terms of the universe, its “nothingness” is such only <i>vis</i> a <i>vis</i> the ‎physical part of the universe; in the celestial regions this “‎אין‎” rules supreme. [as opposed to the ‎חכמה‎ in our part of the universe. Ed. Although ‎יש‎ and ‎אין‎ are popularly perceived as absolute ‎opposites, not having anything in common, this perception is built on a fallacy; the linkage between ‎יש‎ and ‎אין‎ are the <i>mitzvot, </i>Torah commandments, performed by the Jewish people. The ‎commandments are performed in the section of the universe known as ‎יש‎, as a result of which ‎close contact is maintained between the aforementioned two domains of the universe. Ezekiel 1:14 refers to the “<i>mitzvot</i>” in their capacity as providing the link between the terrestrial ‎and the celestial part of the universe with the words ‎והחיות רצוא ושוב‎, “and the <i>chayot</i> ran ‎to and fro”. According to the <i>Zohar II 288, </i>the<i> mitzvot </i>and the Torah respectively, ‎are viewed as related to one another like the “hidden” is related to the “revealed,” both being part ‎of the same whole. Torah and <i>mitzvot</i> provide the link between these two domains, so that ‎each domain is not completely divorced from the other. This concept is contained in the letters of ‎the word ‎מצוה‎ when we divide it up into ‎מצ‎ and ‎וה‎. The letters ‎מצ‎ when we read the alphabet ‎backwards, starting with the letter ‎ת‎ are equivalent to the letters ‎יה‎, symbolising the totally ‎abstract Divinity, whereas the letters ‎יה‎ symbolize the hidden parts of the universe, ‎יש‎. The first ‎half of the word ‎מצוה‎ being read with the two letters used in reverse order of the <i>aleph</i> ‎‎<i>bet</i>, alludes to the “hidden” part of the universe, the domain exclusive to Divine, abstract ‎forces. Let us explain something about what precisely is “hidden” and what is “revealed,” when it ‎comes to the ‎מצוה‎, “Torah commandment.” When we perform a ‎מצוה‎, we cause G’d to become ‎pleased with having created man, the choicest of His creatures. When we comply with requests ‎made to us by a fellow human being, we can immediately gauge whether he is pleased by our ‎actions or not, either by his face indicating this, or by words of approval, something that is not the ‎case when we comply with G’d’s requests from us. Since He is invisible, and does not speak to us ‎as He did to Moses, “mouth to mouth”, we have no way of knowing if our efforts to please Him ‎have been successful. When we try to perform deeds that are for our (immediate) personal ‎benefit, we are able to determine if our efforts have succeeded. This then is the “hidden” element ‎present whenever we perform any of G’d’s commandments, ‎מצות‎. This is what the Torah had in ‎mind when it wrote (Deuteronomy 29,28) ‎הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו‎, “the hidden aspects of ‎‎<i>mitzvah</i> performance are reserved for the Lord our G’d;” on the other hand, ‎והנגלות לנו ‏ולבנינו עד עולם‎, “the benefits which the performance of the Torah confers upon us<i> </i>will be ‎revealed forever.” This is also the meaning of the words ‎בראשית ברא אלוקים‎, (addressed to us) “at ‎the beginning of G’d’s creative activity G’d created the ‎יש‎, a physical domain of the universe.” ‎Through His creating ‎יש‎, i.e. ‎ראשית‎, a beginning, the creation of heaven and earth came into being, ‎for prior to that there was only the ‎אין‎, the abstract universe. This is the meaning of <i>Targum</i> ‎‎<i>Yerushalmi</i> who renders this verse as‎ 'בראשית בחוכמא ברא ה‎', “at the beginning G’d created ‎by means of using intelligence found in the domain of the abstract regions.” ‎חכמה‎, as we pointed ‎out earlier, is a quality inherent in the terrestrial domain.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 23_Paragraph": "‎<small>[The subject is dealt with in a book called ‎עץ חיים‎ by Rabbi Chayim Vittal, foremost disciple of the ‎Ari’zal, in which most of the oral teachings of the Ari’zal have been recorded for posterity. It is ‎understood, based on psalms 104,34-35 ‎אנכי אשמח בה' יתמו חטאים מן הארץ‎, “as a result of my ‎rejoicing in G’d, evil will cease from the earth,” that it is the function of the righteous in our parts of ‎the universe to “repair” the damage the “<i>Shechinah</i>” sustained due to man’s first sin and to ‎restore it to its uncorrupted wholeness. Creation of a physical universe, by definition, required a ‎צמצום‎, voluntary contraction, of the Creator whose universe had previously been filled completely ‎with the holiness of the <i>Shechinah</i>. Since the universe had been “full,” prior to this ‎creation of the physical universe, G’d had to “empty” some of its “space” in order to make room ‎for the new creation. Ed.]</small> The 288 “sparks” that separated from the <i>Shechinah, </i>are the ‎kabbalists’ way of illustrating this<i>. </i> <small>[Possibly the numerical value of 288 being ‎רוח וחיים‎, ‎‎“spirit and life,” accounts for this number 288. Ed.]</small> The tree of knowledge personified these 288 ‎sparks of the <i>Shechinah</i> after they had merged with secular matter, i.e. a mixture of ‎טוב ‏ורע‎, “good and evil,” in the lower part of the universe. G’d had to forbid man to eat from this ‎‎“tree,” in order for the way to remain open for man to “repair” the damage that the ‎‎“<i>Shechinah</i>” had sustained. If man were to eat from it, this would result in an impediment ‎to his ability to restore the <i>Shechinah </i>to its former wholeness. As it were, these “sparks,” ‎descended ever deeper into the physical universe as a result of Adam’s eating from it, and, instead ‎of him restoring the original spiritual light to its former brilliance, he caused the earth to become a ‎spiritually darker domain. The spiritual decline of the earthly environment may be what is ‎described in the Torah as the “death” that would occur, the process only beginning on the day ‎Adam ate, but not resulting in his literal death until many years later. <small>[Needless to say, that man’s ‎task of finding a way to reunite these sparks with the <i>Shechinah</i> from which it had been ‎separated has not been abandoned; however it was made far more difficult as a result of Adam’s ‎sin Ed.]</small> <br>Our author quotes <i>Sanhedrin 99 </i>on<i> B’rachot</i> <i>34 </i>where the Talmud describes ‎the “place” on which repentant sinners stand in the scheme of things as superior to the “place” ‎assigned to the righteous who never knew the taste of sin. If man has sinned, and in spite of this, ‎found his way back to G’d, this is a greater moral ethical achievement than never to have been ‎exposed to the allure of sin in the first place, so that one’s steadfastness in the path of temptation ‎had never been tested.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 13_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎24,28. <b>“when I was already on the way, <i>Hashem</i> ‎guided me to the house of my master’s brothers.” It is ‎noteworthy that the word ‎בדרך‎, “on the way,”</b> is written with the ‎vowel <i>patach</i>, instead of the semi vowel <i>sheva</i> that we ‎would have expected. The former refers to a “definitive path, ‎way, one that was commonly known.” Surely no highway led ‎from Kiryat Arba to Aram Naharayim! We must assume therefore ‎that what Eliezer meant to convey by choosing this word ‎בדרך‎, is ‎not the route that led from Kiryat Arba to Aram Naharayim, but ‎the feeling that he progressed with unnatural speed to his goal, ‎or as the sages in <i>Bereshit rabbah</i> 60,6 say that Eliezer ‎covered a two week journey in a single day, so that he realized ‎that this miracle was proof that his mission would succeed. It was ‎clear to him therefore that the house that he was taken to must ‎be the house of Avraham’s family.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 10_Paragraph": "Going back to <i>Rashi’s</i> first commentary on the first word in the Torah, where he quoted ‎Rabbi Yitzchok saying that the reason that the Torah does not commence with the first verse in ‎Exodus chapter12, is that the Torah wanted to allude from the beginning by teaching the concept ‎כח מעשיו הגיד לעמו לתת להם נחלת גויים‎, “He revealed to His people His powerful works by giving ‎them the heritage of (other) nations.” (Psalms 111,6) This is important to know in the event that ‎the nations will dispute the Jewish people’s claim to the Land of Israel as being their heritage. As ‎the Creator and hence, owner, of the entire universe, G’d has the right to allocate parts of it to ‎whoever He chooses.<br>Expressed differently, since in the words of the introduction to the <i>Zohar, </i>page 5, (based ‎on Proverbs 8,30 (Torah speaking)<i> “</i>then I was with Him<i> (</i>G’d) as an artisan,” i.e. G’d ‎used the Torah and its letters as the tool with which to create the universe; it follows that every ‎part of the universe is imbued with some letter of the Torah.<br>Just as man is charged to perform the Torah’s commandments with the various limbs of his body, ‎‎(248), so earth is also charged with the task of performing “commandments” appropriate to its ‎composition. The expressions ‎פי הארץ‎, ”the earth’s mouth,” or ‎עין הארץ‎, “the earth’s eye,” are ‎more than just figures of speech. Each of our limbs exudes the living essence of the letter of the ‎Torah that corresponds to a specific commandment that limb is supposed to perform. Joshua was ‎able to conquer seven lands (of the Canaanites) because he understood what it was that enabled ‎each specific land to remain “alive.” Similarly, every city in those countries had been charged since ‎creation with performing certain duties <i>vis</i> a <i>vis</i> its Creator. Joshua’s knowledge of ‎these duties enabled him to “conquer” these towns and countries with a minimum of Jewish blood ‎being shed in the process.‎<br>According to the introduction of the <i>Zohar </i>page<i> 5, </i>there is no part of the physical ‎universe that does not in some way reflect the meaning of one of the letters in the Torah. If any of ‎these cities were to confront the invading Jewish armies by calling them “robbers,” Joshua was ‎able to remind them that the previous residents in these towns had only leased the land, but had ‎never owned it, as it is G’d’s property. What could be more natural than that the Jewish people, ‎who by definition serve their Creator by observing the commandments of the Torah, should now ‎make their home on this part of the earth. This is what the psalmist meant when he quoted G’d as ‎having revealed to His people the inherent strength of all His works, ‎כח מעשיו הגיד לעמו‎. Wish that ‎G’d were to grant each one of us the wisdom and the purity of heart to be conversant with the ‎specific commandment that is incumbent upon each limb in our body to perform.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 18_Paragraph": "We know that Yitzchok personified the characteristic/virtue ‎of ‎גבורה‎, steadfast bravery in face of overwhelming odds. We also ‎know that G’d in His love for the Jewish people, arranged for the ‎‎“cure” before the onset of the disease. (<i>Megillah</i> 13) ‎‎(Compare <i>Rashi</i> who describes the period of the Jews’ exile ‎and bondage as having commenced with the birth of Yitzchok. ‎Exodus 12,40) The Torah’s describing the birth of Moav and ‎Ammon, even before the birth of Yitzchok, is another example of ‎the redemption being prepared by G’d even before the onset of ‎exile, seeing that the messiah will be a descendant of Moav, Ruth ‎in David’s maternal ancestry.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 14_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 13,16. <b>“so that if one can count the dust of the earth then ‎your offspring too can be counted.”</b> G’d’s comments were ‎triggered by Avram having seen in his astrology charts that he ‎was not going to have offspring. G’d taught him that “science” ‎such as astrology is valid only in terms of the terrestrial part of ‎the universe. Astrologers therefore are able to decipher only ‎matters accessible to ordinary people’s powers of perception. The ‎Jewish people’s fate could not be predicted on the basis of such ‎limited powers of perception. This is why Jews are not allowed to ‎attempt to count the stars as we know from <i>Yuma</i> 22, ‎where the Talmud states ‎כל המונה את ישראל עובר בלאו‎, “anyone ‎making a headcount of Israelites transgresses a negative ‎commandment.” The Talmud quotes Hoseah 2,1 in support of ‎this. The result of such a count would be misleading, as the ‎yardsticks that apply to other nations do not apply to the Jewish ‎people. Avram who had not yet been aware of this, had therefore ‎misread what appeared to be written in the stars concerning his ‎future. The Talmud Shabbat 156 cites our verse in support of this. <small>‎‎[The verses cited there are Genesis 15,4 and 5. Ed.]</small> Basically, ‎seeing that our prayers and/or repentance have the power to ‎alter G’d’s decrees, how could constellations in the sky that are ‎predictable in advance have any bearing on our fate?‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 21_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 14,19-20 <b>“Blessed be Avram to the Supreme G’d,….and ‎blessed the Supreme G’d Who has delivered your oppressors ‎into your hand.”<br>It is a rule that when G’d deals with a ‎person on the basis of ‎מדה כנגד מדה‎, “measure for measure,”</b> ‎reward or punishment will be in a reciprocal relationship to one ‎another. However, when G’d does not apply this method in ‎dealing with an individual, and He does man a favour-that he has ‎not earned,- he is the recipient of a gift from G’d. Since Avram ‎was a person whose very personality exuded loving kindness, it is ‎clear that G’d reciprocated in equal measure. In this instance, -the ‎victory of a few men under Avram’s command over mighty ‎armies, was something he considered as way in excess of his input ‎thus far. In other words, G’d had given Avram a gift that he had ‎not deserved.The <i>Ari’zal</i> writes that when we recite three ‎times daily the words ‎מלך עוזר ומושיע ומגן‎, “King, Helper, Saviour ‎and Shield,” our sages used this formulation to describe such an ‎undeserved gift from G’d. We also find that Onkelos translates the ‎word ‎חנם‎ in Genesis 29,15 and in Exodus 21,2 as ‎מגן‎. By using this ‎formulation, Malki Tzedek gave Avram a hint that he had ‎received an undeserved gift from G’d. This hint was reinforced by ‎Malki Tzedek referring to G’d as the “Supreme G’d owner of ‎heaven and earth.” What man possesses he does not have to ‎acquire. When he needs something that he does not own, he has ‎to acquire it. Avram did not need to acquire the virtue of loving ‎kindness, as apparently, he personified this virtue since birth; ‎However, the characteristic of ‎גבורה‎, the kind of bravery and ‎heroism needed to wage war successfully, was not a quality he ‎possessed from birth, so that he had to acquire it. Malki Tzedek ‎blesses G’d for having provided Avram with this quality at a time ‎when he was really in need of it. Seeing that G’d “owns” heaven ‎and earth, He is able to bestow this quality on people whenever it ‎suits Him.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 5_Paragraph": "Genesis 18,5. <b>“for this is why your journey has brought you to the ‎house of your servant.”</b> On the face of it, this is a very unusual ‎manner of extending an invitation to passing strangers to partake ‎of a meal with the host. The commentators explained that angels ‎are recipients of the largesse provided by G’d for the Jewish ‎people who have performed G’d’s commandments. In other ‎words, it was G’d Himself, Who took the butter, etc., described in ‎this verse, and served it to these strangers who were angels ‎garbed in human clothing. Avraham, personally, was not able to ‎perform his duties as an attentive host due to his not yet having ‎recovered from the effects of the circumcision. Under normal ‎circumstances, these men would have been denied his hospitality. ‎He therefore explains that due to his having fulfilled the ‎commandment of circumcision, they would in fact be partaking ‎of a meal provided by G’d Himself. They had been sent to him so ‎that he could take credit for hosting them.<br>We have to ‎elaborate somewhat on the tradition that Avraham had been ‎observing, voluntarily, all of the commandments that would later ‎on be found in the Torah. The only exception he had made was ‎the commandment of circumcision. In light of the fact that this ‎commandment was the cornerstone of G’d’s covenant with the ‎Jewish people, why would Avraham purposely have neglected to ‎perform this commandment until being told to observe it? ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 28_Paragraph": "At any rate, when reading our portion, it is clear that the ‎Torah speaks to us no less in parable form than G’d did to Avram ‎when He communicated with him. If a man of the intellectual ‎level of Avram, someone who had been able to work out what ‎would be written in the Torah in the future, had to be addressed ‎by G’d by means of a parable, how much more so do we ordinary ‎mortals need to have the report of such a prophecy “toned ‎down” for us in parable format. The entire paragraph ‎commencing with ‎קחה לי עגלה משולשת וגו'‏‎, “take for me a three ‎year old heifer, etc.,” must be understood allegorically, as Avram ‎was not on the level of Moses so that G’d would have ‎communicated with him verbatim.‎<br>This is also what the Talmud (<i>Yevamot</i> 49) had in mind when ‎we are told there that all the prophets received their ‎communications from G’d through a “screened” vision, with the ‎exception of Moses who enjoyed such communications without ‎any screen having been interposed between G’d and him.‎<br>There is another level of prophetic insights which is ‎somewhat between the level of ordinary prophets and the ‎prophetic level enjoyed by Moses; this level is manifest when the ‎source of the prophecy addresses the intellect of the recipient, ‎but in doing so has voluntarily restricted the intensity of the ‎message so that it does not overwhelm the recipient. It is this ‎level that Avram enjoyed when the word of G’d came to him in ‎what the Torah described as ‎מחזה‎, a “vision.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 14_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 6,21. ‎<b>“and you are to take ‎for yourself some of everything that serves as food, etc;”</b> here ‎the Torah alludes to the reason why until the deluge man was ‎forbidden to eat animals, (according to Nachmanides). Noach ‎saved the animals from extinction during the deluge; he ‎therefore- as representative of the human race- became the ‎‎“owner” of the animal kingdom, and as such entitled to use some ‎of the animals, after due preparation  without causing pain  to ‎the animals, as food for himself. When Avraham, in Genesis 23,13 ‎urged Efron to accept the money he had readied for the purchase ‎of the cave of Machpelah wherein he planned to bury Sarah, the ‎word ‎קח‎ is used as denoting the acquisition of something. ‎Avraham had learned this expression and its meaning from our ‎verse where it is used in this sense for the first time. Noach made ‎an additional acquisition when taking the animal into the ark ‎with him. <small>[He had previously been permitted to use the animals ‎as beasts of burden, etc. Ed.]‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 7_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎18,5. <b>“let me take a piece of bread so that you can refresh ‎yourselves,……he presented it to them and they ate.”</b> The true ‎meaning of this verse has been best explained by the <i>Or ‎Hachayim</i>, according to whom even the highest ranking angel, ‎Michael is on occasion referred to as “High Priest,” whereas on ‎other occasions he is known by another name. <small>[Not in my edition ‎of the ‎אור החיים‎. Ed.]</small> The point of this is to alert us to the fact ‎that the standing, or even existence, of the angels in the celestial ‎spheres, is affected by the <i>mitzvah</i> performance of the ‎Israelites in the terrestrial part of the universe. When Israel is ‎meticulous in the performance of G’d’s Torah, then the most ‎senior of the angels in the celestial spheres assumes the title: ‎‎“High Priest.” When Avraham spoke about a ‎פת לחם‎, instead of ‎merely ‎פת‎, bread, he alludes to both the written and the oral ‎Torah. The word ‎פת‎ refers to the written Torah, whereas the word ‎לחם‎ refers to the oral Torah. The word ‎לחם‎ in psalms 78,25 i.e. ‎לחם אבירים‎, is an allusion to the Torah. According to the Talmud ‎‎<i>Menachot</i> 34, the word ‎פת‎ amongst the Africans means ‎‎“two.” <small>[The latter half of the word: ‎טוטפת‎. Ed.]</small> The word is used ‎as an allusion to Torah also in Proverbs 9,5, ‎לכו לחמו בלחמי‎, “come ‎and partake of My bread.” [Compare Alshich, pages 171-172, my ‎translation of Proverbs. Ed.] When Avraham is now described as ‎serving the angels, we may see in this the reward both for ‎Avraham‘s having performed the circumcision on himself, as well ‎as reward for the angels, their being hosted by a person of ‎Avraham’s standing. <small>[Perhaps the <i>mitzvah</i> of hospitality ‎shown the angels by Lot in the following chapter was a factor in ‎his being saved, whereas his wife was not. Ed.]</small> When Avraham, in ‎verse 8, is described as standing next to the angels while the latter ‎were seated while eating, the “tree” mentioned in that verse may ‎be a reference to the tree described as “tree of life” in Proverbs ‎‎3,18, i.e. an allusion to the Torah.", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 4_Paragraph": "Another way of understanding the statement in the Talmud ‎‎<i>Baba Metzia</i> 87, that until the advent of Avraham there had ‎been no such concept as ‎זקנה‎, “old age,” may be that it referred to ‎the colour of the hair of aged people turning white. <small>[The reader is ‎reminded of Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaryah in the <i>Haggadah shel ‎pessach</i> being prematurely white-haired Ed.]‎</small><br>Just as man’s body wears clothing that gives a hint to the ‎type of person he is, so his mind and soul also wear “clothing” ‎that hint at his age, the hair that covers his head, for instance. ‎Just as man does not experience pain when someone cuts off his ‎clothing, so he does not experience pain when his hair is cut.‎<br>We have previously explained that the Creator, “shrunk His ‎Self,” when entering the domain of the material world in order to ‎be able to share out His loving kindness to His creatures, as ‎otherwise His impact on that world would have been so ‎overwhelming as to destroy it immediately. Similarly, He “dressed ‎Himself” by surrounding His accessibility to His creatures ‎through commandments or the performance of good deeds that ‎He required them to perform in order to enable them to come ‎close to His essence. This is how He made His manifestation on ‎earth possible. The Talmud, when referring to ‎זקנה‎ as a ‎phenomenon that did not exist prior to Avraham, means that ‎Avraham’s performing G’d’s commandments (not yet given as ‎directives) paved the way for G’d to be able to heap His largesse ‎on Avraham’s descendants. The visible evidence of this was the ‎white hair Avraham now sprouted.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 38_Paragraph": "Regardless, of where that <i>Rashi</i> may be, both in our ‎chapter as well as in Exodus 6,8 G’d speaks about the gift of the ‎land of Canaan becoming an inheritance. If Terach had been ‎involved in the matter, why would G’d have to “give” the land to ‎Avram first? In his commentary on <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, on the ‎section dealing with the laws of inheritance, the author of ‎‎<i>Meirat Eynayim</i> states that the expression ‎ירושה‎, ‎inheritance, in legal parlance, applies only to property inherited ‎from one’s biological father. From the wording in Exodus 6,8 as ‎well as from the wording in Genesis 15,18 it is clear that G’d ‎considers Himself as Avram’s “father” in the matter of bestowing ‎on him the “gift” of the land. His offspring, or the part of his ‎offspring to whom he deeds it, will henceforth “inherit.” It. When ‎Avram heard this, he was unclear if he had understood correctly, ‎as he had never heard of an inheritance originating as a gift. ‎Hence he asked ‎במה אדע כי אירשנה‎, by what legal process can I be ‎sure that it will be mine as something to bequeath?” In other ‎words, “who is my father from whom I can inherit this land?” ‎Avram’s question reflects his awareness that “his father” in this ‎instance could not possibly be Terach. In response to Avram’s ‎concerns, G’d answered him: “You shall be aware that your ‎descendants in their formative stages will experience both being ‎strangers and even slaves until at the end of the 400 years, I will ‎judge the people who have subjugated them and treated them ‎cruelly, so that they will leave that land with vast possessions.” ‎G’d’s message to Avram is that the Exodus of this people from the ‎land of their oppression will be due to their being his direct ‎descendants. His very birth paved the way for the Jewish people ‎to come into existence and to in due course accept the very ‎Torah that Avram had already been observing without having ‎been commanded to do so.<br>In light of this, your very birth ‎through Divine input of some holy spirit, seeing that I am your ‎‎“father,” enables Me to speak to you of “inheriting” the land that ‎I am promising to your descendants.” G’d implied that Avram had ‎been quite correct in surmising that Terach had nothing to do ‎with the events occurring in Avram’s future.‎ The author refers to his exegesis of a statement in <i>Baba ‎Batra</i> 117 where the Talmud states that the so-called ‎‎“inheritance” of the Israelites being given the land of Canaan, is ‎quite different from ordinary inheritances. Normally, the living ‎inherit the dead. In the case of the Israelites receiving ancestral ‎land in the Land of Canaan, the dead inherited the living. The ‎‎“normal” process of inheritance is based on the son being a ‎branch of the father, <small>[the father being the trunk. Ed.]</small> The trunk ‎‎(father) provides the elements that enable the branch to achieve ‎its perfection (producing fruit). This parable does not fit the ‎Jewish people and its development. In the history of the Jewish ‎people, the “dead” are the generation of the Israelites that ‎experienced the Exodus as adults, who although not physically ‎living to experience the conquest of the land, “inherited” it, ‎since, but for their existence the next generation could not have ‎taken possession of this land.", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 17_Paragraph": "When considering the events described in that <i>midrash</i>, ‎a number of other difficulties have also been resolved. Eliezer ‎mentioned a number of points that had not come up when ‎Avraham had charged him with his mission.  Why, in relating the ‎events that had transpired at the well, did Eliezer repeat all this ‎prior to asking for Rivkah’s hand in marriage, and even granting ‎that this was worth saying at the time, why is it of interest to us ‎‎4000 years later? These questions are what prompted our sages to ‎conclude that mundane matters discussed by Eliezer were of more ‎interest to the Torah than some of the words of Torah wisdom ‎dwelled upon by Avraham’s scholarly descendants.‎<br>The key to such statements must be sought in the verse 24,1) ‎where the Torah wrote: ‎וה' ברך את אברהם בכל‎, “G’d had blessed ‎Avraham in everything.” Our sages had commented on the word ‎בכל‎, saying it referred to a daughter named ‎בכל‎ about whom the ‎Torah had not reported previously. We will try and offer two ‎explanations to this somewhat enigmatic statement by our sages.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 28_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎21,25. <b>“Avraham rebuked Avimelech on account of the ‎well, etc.”</b> Avimelech rejected the accusation, claiming he had ‎not known about what his servants had done.<br>Normally, we ‎have a rule that when a <i>tzaddik</i> engages in rebuking ‎someone, he points out that the trespass committed by the ‎wicked concerned was a sin against G’d and His Torah.<br>In this ‎instance, Avraham accused Avimelech of having committed a ‎wrong when it had been his servants who had stolen the water ‎from Avraham. He reminded Avimelech that G’d created the ‎world, and that He gave us laws by which to conduct ourselves, ‎and that robbery was definitely forbidden. The person violating ‎G’d’s law receives a warning in the form of the <i>tzaddik</i> ‎rebuking him. The letters in the words uttered by the ‎‎<i>tzaddik</i> when he rebukes the sinner light up in the face of ‎the guilty party, thus affording him an opportunity to ‎immediately do penance.‎<br>One of the names of G’d is: ‎מי‎, as we know when Pharaoh ‎challenged Moses by saying: ‎מי ה'‏‎? This is what Avimelech meant ‎when he said to Avraham ‎לא ידעתי מי עשה את הדבר הזה‎, “I do not ‎know of this ‎מי‎ who has done this;” i.e. “I have never heard of a ‎Creator who has created the universe, hence I do not know of a ‎prohibition to steal or rob.” Another one of G’d’s names is the ‎word ‎זה‎, as we know from Exodus 15,2 ‎זה א-לי ואנוהו‎, “‎זה‎ is my G’d ‎and I will glorify Him.” We also find the word as a reference to ‎one of G’d’s names when Isaiah 25,9 said ‎זה ה' קוינו לו‎, “we have ‎been hoping for the Lord ‎זה‎.” Avimelech tells Avraham that he ‎had heard of all this theology only from the mouth of Avraham, ‎he had never previously been informed of this. He adds that even ‎now he has not heard or “seen” the letters that make up the ‎alphabet of the Torah from Avraham’s mouth, i.e. ‎גם אתה לא ‏הגדת לי‎. The word ‎הגדת‎, derived from ‎גד‎, is similar to ‎גד גדוד יגודנה‎ ‎in Genesis 49,19, where it refers to “good fortune,” similar to ‎what Gad’s mother proclaimed ‎בגד‎, viewing herself as having good ‎fortune seeing that she had born 6 of the twelve tribes. (Genesis ‎‎30,11) The word is a simile for good fortune in the sense of ‎מזל ‏טוב‎. Avimelech had not yet seen the letters that would trigger his ‎doing teshuvah for the wrong he had been guilty of. The word ‎אתה‎ ‎is an allusion to the letters from ‎א‎ to ‎ת‎ in the Hebrew alphabet, ‎the letters of the Holy Tongue.‎<br>When Avimelech adds: ‎וגם אנכי לא שמעתי בלתי היום‎, “and I ‎also have not heard about all this until this day,” he uses the ‎word ‎אנכי‎, the first word of the Ten Commandments with which ‎G’d revealed Himself at Mount Sinai, as meaning that on this day ‎G’d’s sovereignty was revealed to him, and he could now perceive ‎these letters of the Holy Tongue. On that day Avimelech had ‎learned from Avraham about three aspects of G’d, i.e. ‎מי, זה, אנכי‎.‎",

To the question ‎why Ishmael had been endowed by G’d with such greatness, the ‎answer is that this was the reward for his agreeing to have himself ‎circumcised at an age when this is extremely painful. There is, ‎however, a minor difference between the type of circumcision ‎performed on Ishmaelites and that performed on Jews, i.e. an ‎extra thin membrane around the glans being removed in a ‎‎<i>halachic</i> circumcision.

This ‎‎“fear” is the fear of disappointing the loved one by not ‎responding to his will as he had hoped you would. If there had ‎been any need to prove that G’d abhors human sacrifice, He ‎demonstrated this not by never having commanded it, but by ‎having commanded it and cancelled the command before it could ‎be executed.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 20_Paragraph": "<b>\"A river comes out of Eden to irrigate the garden;”</b> compare on <i>Avot</i> 2,1 ‎הוי זהיר במצוה קלה ‏כבחמורה‎, “be as meticulous concerning the performance of commandments deemed as ‎inconsequential, as you are with the performance of commandments deemed of great ‎significance, since you do not know the amount of reward in store for any of the commandments.” ‎Our sages explained that the author of this saying referred to the amount of satisfaction that the ‎performance of each commandment gives to the Creator. We mortals have no way of gauging ‎what ranks high in the esteem of the lawgiver. The only thing that we know definitely about this is ‎that as a result of the satisfaction that G’d derived from our <i>mitzvah</i> performance He will ‎give us opportunities to perform more commandments. When a father hears words of wisdom ‎from his son, he encourages him to come up with more wise comments. Similarly, when G’d ‎derived pleasure and satisfaction from the deeds of one of His “children,” He encourages that ‎‎“child” to continue to come up with intelligent questions and answers.&lt;‎br&gt;‎<i>Eden</i>, this describes the pleasure derived by G’d from His children’s words of Torah and ‎performance of His commandments, whereas the word ‎גן‎, “garden,” is a reference to the various ‎levels at which Torah can be studied, i.e. just as a garden contains many flowers, each of which ‎having a distinct appearance and pleasing aroma. The words of Torah His children speak by means ‎of which they provide spiritual irrigation in all the four directions of the earth, are alluded to by: ‎‎“the river splitting into four heads,” in our verse.‎<br>Performance of the commandments is perceived as “irrigating” the brain (cranium) that consists of ‎‎4 cavities, one of them being a cavity divided into two parts. This “stream” channels this inspiration ‎directly from G’d, and branches out into 4 “rivers,” each channeling inspiration to the four lobes of ‎the brain that fill these cavities. Each branch feeds the appropriate lobe, according to its function. ‎The word ‎עדן‎ describes the region from which ‎תענוג‎, pleasurable experiences emanate. The word ‎גן‎ in this allegory includes the various disciplines comprising Torah study, commonly known as ‎‎<i>peshat</i>, plain meaning of the text, <i>drush</i>, allegorical meaning, homily, <i>remez</i>, ‎allusion, hint, and <i>sod, </i>mystical aspects. Keeping this in mind, we can understand why the ‎‎<i>mishnah</i> quoted began with a warning, i.e. <i>‎הוי‎</i> <i>‎זהיר‎</i>, “be careful to discern,” ‎seeing that the same <i>mishnah </i>told us that we do not know how the various ‎commandments rate in terms of the reward for those who perform them. Since we do not know, ‎how are we to distinguish between what is weighty, and what is relatively less weighty in the eyes ‎of G’d? Most likely the answer is that the commandments described as ‎קלה‎ are the ones that we ‎can find opportunities to perform, such as studying Torah, whereas the ones described as ‎חמורה‎, ‎are those that a person may have few opportunities to perform in a lifetime, or no opportunity at ‎all. ‎<br> <small>‎[Since mitzvah performance is incumbent both on the individual and the entire nation, we each ‎share in the performance of those who do have an opportunity to perform those, such as the ‎levirate marriage, to name just one. Ed.]‎ </small><br>The author of the <i>mishnah</i> warns not to use the fact that some <i>mitzvot</i> can be ‎fulfilled all the time as an excuse to postpone fulfilling same, as we do not know how even these ‎‎<i>mitzvot</i> rate in terms of the reward in store for us.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 21_Paragraph": "Another approach to the allegory of: “river, garden, and ‘Eden.’” It is well known that every Jew is ‎obligated to acquire and maintain good character traits and to make them second nature. By doing ‎so he provides G’d with satisfaction. When serving his Creator by personifying these positive ‎virtues, he enables the Creator to ”boast” of His creatures, <small>[as for instance we find when G’d ‎‎“boasted” to Satan about the piety of Job. (Job 1,8) Ed.]</small> These “virtues” are described in ‎‎<i>Avot</i> 2,1 as ”in the eyes of his peers.” The author of the <i>mishnah, </i>Rabbi<i> ‎‎</i>Yehudah<i> hanassi, </i>uses the expression<i> </i>‎תפארת לעושיה‎, to describe that man’s ‎Creator can use this as “boasting” or justifying His having created the human species. When ‎reading these words superficially we must wonder why G’d is interested i.e. in “need” of our ‎actions, seeing He has myriads of angels ready to do His bidding. However, the very fact that His ‎people, the Jewish people, who have been assigned the “lower” portion of the universe as their ‎habitat with all the disadvantages that are prevalent in that region, distinguish themselves by their ‎loyal service to Him nonetheless, is something extraordinary, that cannot be compared with ‎angels. This is what Rabbi Yehudah <i>hanassi</i> had in mind when he described loyal service to ‎G’d by His free-willed creature, man, as being ‎תפארת לו מן האדם‎, “something glorious for Him ‎performed by man.” G’d certainly has reason to “boast” about such devotion when telling Satan ‎that in spite of his activities as seducer and spoiler, there are people who have not been deterred ‎in their loyalty to Their Creator. Genesis 2,10-14 describes this whole process of man being ‎encouraged by G’d to develop the appropriate virtues and how having acquired them his Creator ‎derives great satisfaction from that. The simile used by the Torah of describing man’s watering ‎G’d’s “garden” read: “worlds,” as something that He takes pride in, is therefore a well chosen ‎euphemism.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 2_Paragraph": "Let us take a look at how <i>Rashi,</i> the most eminent of all Torah commentators, explained the ‎first verse of the Torah. Quoting Rabbi Yitzchok, <i>Rashi</i> writes: “on the face of it the (written) ‎Torah need not have commenced until the chapter commencing with the laws of the Passover. ‎‎(Exodus 12)” In light of what we have just explained, the fact that the Torah commences as it does ‎is eminently plausible. What did <i>Rashi </i>have in mind then? The background of <i>Rashi</i>, ‎seizing on the explanation of Rabbi Yitzchok as his point of departure of his entire commentary on ‎the Torah, is none other than to remind us of how much the beginning of the Torah has in common ‎with what is written in chapter 12 in Exodus.", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 19_Paragraph": "When he examine the Biblical ‎text quoted by the Talmud in <i>B’rachot</i> 12 in order to prove ‎that the translator must speak in lower decibels than the reader ‎more closely, (which at first glance appears to prove the opposite ‎of what is postulated), we have to remember that Moses was ‎considered as the patriarch of all future prophets and Torah ‎scholars. In spite of this, we all know that Moses’ prophetic ‎pronouncements were far easier to understand than those of all ‎the prophets following him. The reason that this was so was that ‎the <i>Shechinah</i> spoke directly out of Moses’ throat (<i>Chavot ‎Daat, 232</i>) whereas the prophets subsequent to him were only ‎relating what they had seen in a vision, so that they had to ‎‎“describe“ that vision in order to make it intelligible to their ‎listeners. Keeping these facts in mind, the exegesis of the Talmud ‎is absolutely correct, as G’d Himself plays the role of the ‎‎“Translator.” It remains for us to explain what Nachmanides ‎meant when he wrote that Yitzchok wanted Yaako’s blessing to ‎remain ‎שלא מדעת‎, unknown to him, something that he was not ‎aware of.‎<br>The <i>Ari z’al</i> wrote the following commentary on ‎‎<i>Kohelet</i> 8,9 ‎עת אשר שלט האדם באדם לרע לו‎, “there is a time ‎when man rules over another man intending to harm him.” ‎When G’d wishes to place a holy soul on earth He first needs to ‎prepare a ritually unclean spot on earth for him. Were He not to ‎do this, the attribute of Justice, Satan, could succeed in ‎preventing Him from carrying out His design. However, once the ‎attribute of Justice has taken note that this “holy” soul is ‎surrounded by ritual uncleanness, the attribute of Justice, i.e. ‎Satan, does not worry about the holy soul’s chances of being ‎successful in such surroundings. Hence it will not lavish much ‎attention on that soul. Being thus unmolested by Satan for a ‎while, the holy soul can develop roots and prosper, enabling it to ‎pursue its appointed task. This is why Avraham was born to the ‎idol merchant Terach. Once Satan was aware of this, he did not ‎worry about how Avraham would develop until Avraham had ‎already established a powerful presence on earth himself, one that ‎could challenge Satan. This is also why David’s roots were in Lot ‎and his daughter; Satan never suspected that Lot would sire a ‎daughter whose descendant would become the convert from ‎whom David, and eventually the messiah could emerge. ‎Yitzchok’s not wanting to bless Yaakov publicly, was intended to ‎protect him from an assault by Satan. This is also why Avraham ‎was meant to pursue the four Kings and their armies in order to ‎save Lot, so that he could fulfill his destiny in becoming a forbear ‎of David. According to the <i>Ari z’al</i> some people attain ‎tremendous power early on in their career only, imagining that ‎they control the whole of mankind. Sooner or later, their empire ‎falls apart and ends in ruin. Yitzchok held back with blessing ‎Yaakov until after he had blessed Esau in order for the latter to ‎enjoy his blessing, only to decline through his abuse of the ‎powers he enjoyed; at that time Yaakov, his descendants, the ‎Jewish people, would rise to fame never to decline and disappear ‎from the stage of history. Yaakov, in time, would destroy all the ‎forces on earth that personify ritual contamination, ‎טומאה‎. At ‎that time all of G’d’s blessings not pronounced by Yitzchok would ‎be fulfilled. ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 0_Paragraph": "Genesis 6,9.‎ <b>“The Lord said to Avram: ‘go for ‎yourself,’ etc.”</b> Many commentators ask why Avram endangered ‎Sarai by taking her with him to Egypt, seeing that G’d had not ‎given any instruction for either him or his wife to go to Egypt? ‎The answer may be in the words: ‎אל הארץ אשר אראך‎, “to the land ‎that I will show you.” By being vague about Avram’s destination, ‎and not naming the country, G’d may have hinted that Avram ‎should move to any country which circumstances would indicate ‎as a suitable destination for him. Hence, when he came to <i>Eretz ‎Yisrael</i> and shortly thereafter a famine struck that land, he ‎reasoned that it was time for him to move further south, to ‎Egypt where there was no famine. This is the meaning of 12,10 ‎ויהי רעב בארץ וירד אברם מצרימה כי כבד הרעב בארץ‎, “It was that when ‎a famine broke out in the land, Avram descended to Egypt as the ‎famine in the land was severe.” He took the outbreak of the ‎famine as a sign from G’d not to remain in the land of Canaan, but ‎to move on.

We must therefore endeavour to find a <i>mussar</i>, ‎ethical instruction, alluded to in every detail of the ark that the ‎Torah provides. Ed.]‎</small>",

G’d responded that ‎this was why He employed the Torah as His assistant, so that ‎people would see that any reference to G’d as the merciful, ‎patient G’d, etc., would not be an empty compliment. In other ‎words, the principal attribute of G’d at work on earth is G’d’s ‎attribute of Mercy. The words of the <i>Zohar</i> are echoed by ‎‎<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 12, where the <i>Midrash</i> states that G’d ‎employed the attribute of Mercy as His partner when creating ‎Man. The <i>Midrash</i> quotes the words ‎כאשר עשיתי‎, as the ‎source for its statement. The author of that <i>Midrash</i> ‎understands G’d as saying that just as He had employed the ‎attribute of Mercy when creating the universe, (man) so He will ‎henceforth continue to employ this attribute in large measure. As ‎a result, He will not again bring a deluge of the dimensions ‎experienced in the time of Noach.‎",

We have a rule that when a person performs ‎a mitzvah that reflects his attribute of ‎חסד‎, love for his fellow, he ‎‎“awakens” parallel “waves” of ‎חסד‎ in the celestial regions. As a ‎result, the whole world will benefit from the ‎חסד‎ that his ‎‎<i>mitzvah</i> awakened. Since all of the <i>mitzvoth</i> ‎performed by Avraham reflected this attribute of ‎חסד‎ of his, they ‎inspired other people to perform similar acts of loving kindness. ‎Rivkah had been enabled, in spite of her extreme youth, to feel ‎the urge to also perform deeds of human kindness. Eliezer prayed ‎to G’d to let him meet someone who would reflect this wonderful ‎attribute of his master Avraham.

The very idea that Avram requested ‎some kind of visible token or miracle to confirm the fact that G’d ‎would keep His promise is revolting! Since when is G’d required to ‎confirm His prophecy by performing a miracle?<br>Furthermore, ‎if this was the meaning of Avram’s question, he should have ‎asked: “how do I know that You will give the land to me!” After ‎all, this was what G’d’s promise to him had sounded like. To the ‎average reader of the Torah, G’d’s words meant that the reason ‎G’d had saved Avram from Nimrod’s furnace was in order to give ‎him the land of Canaan. Besides, how does G’d’s answer that ‎Avram would die at a ripe old age long before the 400 years He ‎had spoken of would have ended, answer Avram’s question? How ‎is the promise that after 400 years of being strangers in a foreign ‎land, and slaves to wit, and that the fourth generation would ‎leave bondage with great riches, relevant to Avram’s ‎question?<br>If, according to the plain meaning of the text, G’d’s ‎answer included a punishment for Avram’s having questioned ‎that G’d would keep His promise the prediction that his offspring ‎would have to endure a period of enslavement in a foreign land, ‎before leaving their with great riches, how does the line ‎commencing with ‎ידוע תדע וגו'‏‎, contain even the remotest hint of ‎this? We do not find anywhere an allusion that Avram’s question ‎of ‎במה אדע כי אירשנה‎, “by means of what sign will I know that I will ‎inherit it,” was in any way inappropriate, much less punishable! ‎On the contrary, the assurance that Avram himself would not ‎share either the exile of the slavery but would die contentedly of ‎old age, sounds like the opposite of any punishment!

An example given by ‎the <i>Mishnah</i> illustrating this is that whereas two vessels ‎which require ritual purification through immersion in a ritual ‎bath may be cleansed even when one of them is inside the other, ‎this ruling is not valid when the vessels in question belong to a ‎higher level of holiness known as ‎קדשים‎, vessels used in handling ‎the remains of sacrificial animals, for instance. Apparently, the ‎author of this <i>Mishnah</i> relates the rules pertaining to ‎cleansing vessels that have become ritually impure to their ‎respective origins.

The wording of the <i>Mishnah</i>, i.e.‎חומר בקודש ‏מבתרומה ‏‎, can be understood allegorically as: “the reason why ‎higher ranking holiness is subject to more stringent steps of ‎purification than lower ranking holy vessels, is because the higher ‎ranking ones had been inside the lower ranking ones.” The word ‎תרומה‎ chosen by the <i>Mishnah</i>, has a double meaning, i.e. it ‎is something in need of being elevated further. Applied to the ‎צדיק‎ in our parable, it means that the <i>tzaddik</i> engaged in ‎‎“outreach,” must be much more on guard against being drawn ‎into the sphere of the sinner than the kind of <i>tzaddik</i> who ‎does not venture to mix with the sinners even in order to bring ‎them closer to G’d.

The latter attribute is the one that ‎his son Yitzchok would symbolize for us in the future.<br>It is ‎part of our tradition that whenever the attributes of ‎אהבה‎ and ‎יראה‎, i.e. ‎אש‎, and ‎מים‎, “fire and water,” in terms of our terrestrial ‎part of the universe, are present simultaneously, due to the fact ‎that these two attributes are opposites of one another, we require ‎the presence of a third attribute one that harmonizes between ‎these two opposite attributes. This third attribute is known as ‎תפארת‎, harmony; the third of our patriarchs, Yaakov, is perceived ‎by our sages as having characterized the attribute “harmony.” It ‎follows that at the time of Avraham’s circumcision this third ‎attribute had been present also, i.e. it had a part to play in the ‎performance of that commandment. When the Torah speaks of ‎what Avraham “saw,” it referred to Avraham’s having become ‎aware at that moment that these three attributes, all of which ‎can be part of ‎מצוה‎ performance, had had a part in his having ‎circumcised himself at the command of G’d. The word: ‎נצבים‎, ‎describes the “presence” of all these three attributes during ‎Avraham’s recovery from the physical effects of the circumcision.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 3_Paragraph": "Concerning G’d’s adding that Avram was to move away from ‎his birthplace etc., ‎מארצך, ממולדך‎, G’d made clear that contrary to ‎the norm that when someone moves to a new place he generally ‎has some roots there already and he will be accompanied by “the ‎sparks” (see my discussion of this term on page 21), in this ‎instance G’d told Avram that this move would be of a different ‎dimension. He was to leave behind all that tied him to his ‎previous abode. While he would now proceed in the direction of ‎his true spiritual roots, what had gone before had no connection ‎with his true roots. It had now become his destiny to restore the ‎‎“sparks” that accompanied him to their true homes. We find an ‎interesting verse in Samuel I 7,17, where the author writes ‎ותשובתו הרמתה כי שם ביתו‎, “and Samuel returned to Ramah, for ‎that was where his home was.” The words “for that was where his ‎home was,” are redundant as the reader is familiar with this fact. ‎The prophet added these words to inform the reader that the ‎prophet Samuel could be “at home,” wherever he decided to ‎spend the night. His “roots” were so inextricably linked to his ‎people that he was at home in any place in the land of Israel. The ‎same was true, of course, of Moses and Aaron.‎ ", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 41_Paragraph": "Up until the time when Avram left Charan he had served G’d ‎by engaging the three attributes we just mentioned. Now that his ‎quest to be near to his Creator would be reinforced by his being ‎on holy soil, he would qualify for more comprehensive revelations ‎from G’d, enabling him to proceed from serving G’d out of ‎feelings of awe to serving Him out of feelings of love.<br>We have ‎already explained why G’d promised Avram that He would make ‎his name great, that he would be a source of blessing to all with ‎whom he would come into contact and that his name would be ‎‎“great.” (pages 41-44) We ask ourselves, that if Avram had ‎followed G’d’s instructions to set out into a new and unknown ‎land without having first been given these assurances by G’d if he ‎would not have earned a great deal more merit than he did after ‎being “armed” with these promises?<br>In fact, the reverse is the ‎case. When the Torah tells us that Avram set out in accordance ‎with the instructions he had received from G’d (Genesis 12,4) the ‎reason the Torah adds the words: “as G’d had commanded him,” is ‎to inform us that the only reason Avram emigrated from Charan ‎was because G’d had told him to. It did not occur to Avram that ‎the promises G’d had made to him would be fulfilled by his ‎obeying G’d. <small>[Compare <i>Or Hachayim</i> on this verse, or my ‎translation of his commentary on page 123 Ed.]</small> Accordingly, if ‎Avraham had not known that he would receive a reward for ‎undertaking this journey and all that it entailed, it would not ‎even have rated as one of his “ten trials,” so that his reward ‎would have been much less. Being able to serve the Lord after ‎having received promises from Him, without these promises ‎affecting the quality of his service, was a far greater ethical ‎achievement than serving the Lord altruistically, but not ‎knowing that such service carries the promise of a reward. G’d’s ‎challenging Avram to do just this was the essence of the trial.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 11_Paragraph": "An alternative approach to the meaning of this verse, not ‎substantially different from the previous one. There are two ‎different methods in which man can serve his Creator. The first ‎method is based on man’s awe and reverence for his Creator. The ‎second method is based on man’s love for his Creator. The basic ‎difference between these two approaches is that he who serves ‎the Lord because of his awe and reverence for Him, reflects the ‎fact that he is rooted in the ‎יש‎, the material reality of the ‎terrestrial part of the universe, someone who is conscious of the ‎limitations of the transience of life, and the finite nature of ‎everything physical; it is natural that he is overcome with awe for ‎the source of this finite universe, the Creator.‎",

        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 22_Paragraph": "‎Genesis (24,12) We need to examine why Betuel and family at first ‎agreed to Rivkah’s becoming Yitzchok’s bride, (verse 50) but ‎apparently changed their minds subsequently. (Verse 55). We ‎must remember that both Lavan and Betuel, even when ‎appearing to agree, had evil intentions. (see <i>Rashi</i>, ‎according to whom they planned to assassinate Eliezer) Their ‎principal motivation was to prevent Yitzchok from having ‎children that would grow to maturity and survive. (<i>Gittin</i> 64) ‎The Talmud there discusses the subject of a betrothal by means of ‎an emissary, in the absence of a face to face meeting between ‎bride and groom. According to the <i>halachah</i>, as long as the ‎emissary is still on the way, i.e. has not returned from his mission, ‎the sender (Yitzchok) is not allowed to marry any other woman. ‎The reason for this is that he might, unwittingly marry someone ‎forbidden to him for reasons of incest. (In the event that his ‎emissary had already carried out his mission) For this reason, ‎Rivkah’s family first expressed their willingness, so that Yitzchok ‎was “married,” and then by killing him hoped to prevent him ‎from returning to his sender and announcing that he had ‎completed his mission.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 18_Paragraph": "Another approach to the paragraph commencing with ‎אלה תולדות השמים והארץ‎: Originally, man as ‎G’d’s final act of creation, and therefore the most sophisticated creature in the universe, was ‎perceived as superior to the angels even by the angels themselves. However, this was before man ‎had sinned. Ever since, the angels are viewed as superior to man. When the psalmist in psalms ‎‎148,13 speaks of ‎הודו על ארץ ושמים‎, “His splendour covers earth and heaven,” in that order, he ‎draws attention to the condition of man on this earth as it will be when man has attained his true ‎stature prior to the ultimate redemption. Up until then, due to his sin and consequently residing in ‎an imperfect part of the universe after having been expelled from <i>Gan Eden,</i> he had not ‎yet attained the stature envisaged for him by his Creator. Hence the psalmist, quite realistically, ‎describes G’d’s glory as it is on earth before describing it as it is in the heavens. It is only after the ‎redemption, when the prophet describes the state of man with the words: ‎כי מלאה הארץ דעה את ‏ה‎' , “when the earth will be full of knowledge of the Lord,” (Isaiah 11,9) that the vision of the ‎psalmist will be realized. The word ‎תולדות‎ in the verse under discussion means the same as ‎תכלית‎, ‎objective, purpose. The purpose of the creation of the lower parts of the universe was that on the ‎day when the messiah comes, earth, where G’d wishes to make His permanent home, will rank ‎higher in the hierarchy of the universes than the celestial regions. Once Israel will attain that rank ‎they will have reached the level known as “ayin,” ‎אין‎, a level higher than that of the angels in the ‎heavenly hierarchy. <small>[The author had explained earlier that the level of ‎אין‎, is a state that existed ‎before G’d began with creating anything that contained an element of “substance,” three-‎dimensional matter.

One category has earned the title ‎‎“<i>tzaddik</i>” because he serves only the one and only true G’d, ‎the Creator, and believes that this Creator is all powerful and ‎guides the universe in accordance with His wishes.<br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmeni in Moed Katan 16 commenting ‎on Samuel II 23,1 where the prophet introduces King David’s last ‎utterances, (actually a “hymn,”) with the words: ‎נאום דוד בן ישי ‏ונאום הגבר הוקם על‎, ”words of David son of Yishai, and of the ‎strong man who has been elevated and anointed by G’d, etc.” He ‎continues there in verse 3: ‎אמר אלוקי ישראל לי דבר צור ישראל מושל ‏באדם צדיק מושל יראת אלוקים‎, “Israel’s G’d said concerning me: ‘be ‎ruler over mankind, be ruler over awe of G’d.’” According to Rabbi ‎Shmuel bar Nachmeni, the somewhat enigmatic verse must be ‎understood as follows: David, who had raised high the banner of ‎repentance (when he said to the prophet Natan in response to his ‎rebuke that he had been guilty of without ifs or buts in the ‎matter of Bat Sheva) “G’d rules man, whereas the righteous rules ‎G’d.” What is meant by “the righteous rules G’d?” Initially G’d ‎decrees what man’s fate will be; however, the intercession of a ‎‎<i>tzaddik’s</i> prayer” may result in G’d’s decree being cancelled.” ‎The Talmud suggests that when a <i>tzaddik</i> is not only ‎concerned with his own salvation but endeavours to bring sinners ‎closer to G’d, his prayer can influence G’d to the extent that He ‎will cancel a decree of death already promulgated in heaven ‎against certain individuals or groups of people. Noach, alas, did ‎not engage in active attempts to influence people by rebuking ‎them.<br><small>‎[No doubt, whenever Noach was asked during the 120 years ‎that he built the ark why he did so, he told his peers that G’d had ‎instructed him to do this in order to escape the deluge that would ‎occur. Ed.]‎</small><br>One of the reasons that he did not pray for his fellow man ‎may have been that he felt inadequate to be able to cancel a ‎decree that G’d had told him He had issued. He may have been ‎motivated by considerations we encounter in connection with ‎Neuchadnezzar (<i>Sanhedrin 92</i>). We are told there that when ‎throwing Chananyah, Michael and Azaryah into a fiery furnace ‎from which all three were saved, G’d also commanded Ezekiel to ‎revive the dead bones of the Jews that had been killed by ‎Nevuchadnezzar when he destroyed Jerusalem and burned the ‎Temple. One of the newly revived was instructed to touch ‎Nevuchadnezzar on his forehead and to identify himself as one of ‎the many thousands who had been resurrected. Nevuchadnezzar ‎was so impressed that he began to compose songs of praise ‎extolling the Almighty. Thereupon an angel shut ‎Nevuchadnezzar’s mouth to prevent him from continuing. Had ‎the angel not done so, all the hymns composed by King David ‎would have lost in value when compared to the songs composed ‎by Nevuchadnezzar.<br>The word used by the Talmud to describe what would have ‎occurred is ‎לגנות‎, “to denigrate, or defame.” When reminding ‎ourselves of the <i>tzaddik’s</i> ability, under certain conditions ‎to reverse a decree that originated from the Attribute of Justice, ‎and to cause it to become a beneficial decree, we can understand ‎why Nevuchadnezzar had begun to sing the Lord’s praises; <small>[after ‎all he had deliberately destroyed G’d’s Temple on earth. Ed.]</small> When ‎he noticed that Ezekiel’s prayers had resulted in an army of ‎people being resurrected, he became afraid that another prayer ‎by the same person, or persons like him, would result in his life’s ‎work, the destruction of the Temple, being reversed also. In order ‎to pre-empt any prayer by any <i>tzaddik</i> being able to achieve ‎this, he tried to pre-empt anyone from offering such a prayer and ‎being granted his request, by extolling G’d’s greatness in even ‎more glowing terms than David had done in the Book of Psalms.‎<br>Noach, far from being a boastful individual, proclaiming ‎himself as a major deity, was the very opposite, a humble person, ‎to whom it would not have occurred that a prayer of his would ‎influence G’d to reverse a decree which He had certainly not ‎arrived at without first having agonized over it. <small>[He even told ‎Noach that He would delay execution of this decree for up to 120 ‎years, this is why He told Noach when he was 480 years old to ‎start building the ark. Ed.]</small> It was because he did not consider ‎himself as especially righteous, that he reasoned that just as he ‎would be saved, so there must be numerous other people of ‎similar stature who would also be saved. When G’d noticed this, ‎He told Noach (Genesis 6,13) that He would have to proceed with ‎His intention to destroy the human race as there was no one who ‎had tried to intercede on their behalf. Nonetheless, He made plain ‎to Noach, that although he had not interceded on behalf of his ‎fellow humans, He would maintain the existing covenant between ‎G’d and mankind through Noach and his family. (Genesis 6,18).", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 0_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 23,1. <b>“The years of Sarah’s life were one hundred years, ‎etc.;”</b> I believe, G’d willing, that I have understood the reason ‎why Sarah is the only woman in the Bible of whose age at the ‎time of her death we have been told. The Talmud <i>Nedarim</i> ‎‎64, in referring to Rachel’s outburst (Genesis 30,1) that unless her ‎husband Yaakov would give her children she considered herself as ‎‎“dead,” is quoted by <i>Rashi</i> on that verse saying that seeing ‎that a woman’s primary task in life is to mother children, any ‎woman who has not given birth to a live child is considered as ‎dead. We also know from <i>Shabbat</i> 156, that when G’d took ‎Avraham outside (Genesis 15,5) that He showed him that ‎according to the constellation of the stars, Sarai was not slated to ‎give birth to children. This ‎מזל‎, astrological prognosis of her life, ‎could be changed only due to merits she would acquire during the ‎years to come. She did indeed acquire such merits, as our sages ‎conclude from a comment they made in <i>Shir Hashirim ‎Rabbah</i>, 2,32 where the phenomenon of all the matriarchs ‎originally being barren is discussed. Among a variety of answers ‎offered there, one is that G’d was desirous of listening to their ‎praying to Him to be granted children, just as He is desirous of ‎listening to the prayers of the righteous, generally. In other ‎words, Sarah, (after a name change) both due to her merits and ‎her supplications, was “lifted” out of the limitations predicted for ‎her by a zodiac sign she had been born under, so that she could ‎conceive. When the Torah refers to her “life” as being 127 years ‎long, this means nothing less than that she had spent all these ‎years accumulating merits for the good deeds she performed. ‎Expressed somewhat differently, the Torah states that it was ‎Sarah, who with her good deeds gave “life” to her years.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 7_Paragraph": "Let us proceed to explain some aspects about Yitzchok’s and ‎Rivkah’s marital union and its implications. We must take note ‎that the marital unions of the patriarchs and their details have ‎been described in the Torah, with the exception of the union of ‎Avram and Sarai at the time. Seeing that at the time Avram ‎married Sarai he was not yet a founding father of the Jewish ‎nation, the Torah did not see fit to give us any details about that ‎union and how it came about. We have explained previously that ‎names reflect the soul’s origin, so that when both Avram’s and ‎Sarai’s names were changed they also experienced a change in ‎their souls. The union of Avram and Sarai had not produced any ‎offspring, and until both their names were changed by Divine ‎decree they could not become patriarchs and matriarchs, ‎respectively. This leaves us with the question why the names of ‎Yitzchok and Rivkah were not changed so that they would not ‎have become parents of an Esau? Avraham’s name was changed in ‎order that his attribute of ‎חסד‎ could take root in the world and ‎enable him to be active spreading this virtue. By doing this he ‎incidentally illuminated the world with some of the Divine light ‎that had been withheld since Adam’s sin. We have explained ‎previously that this Divine light, brightness, cannot be allowed to ‎keep on getting stronger without endangering the existence of ‎the human race while man had not kept pace with the spiritual ‎growth needed to tolerate these infusions of Divine light. It was ‎Yitzchok’s task to preserve the limitation of this accomplishment ‎of his father Avraham without endangering his achievements by ‎recklessly leading where his contemporaries could not follow and ‎keep in step. This is why his name, as opposed to that of his ‎father or his son Yaakov, was never changed. Just as G’d had to ‎impose limitations on Himself before becoming active in a ‎material world, so Avram before becoming active as a patriarch, ‎had to impose limitations on himself. The name ‎אברם‎, “a ‎towering personality in lofty regions,” was appropriate as long as ‎he had not been charged with spreading monotheism through his ‎loving concern for his fellow throughout the regions in which he ‎would sojourn. Once this became his primary task, the name ‎change from ‎אברם‎ to ‎אברהם‎, i.e. “father of many (terrestrial) ‎nations,” and mirrored his becoming more effective in our ‎terrestrial regions. He himself could not produce personal issue ‎until he had begun the task assigned to him on earth. Yaakov, ‎who as we explained, represented a fusion of the attributes of his ‎father and his grandfather, had his name changed to Israel, when ‎he had matured to the point of representing this meld of loving ‎kindness on the one hand, and awe of G’d on the other. <br><small>‎[No other patriarch is quoted as having been “afraid” as many ‎times as Yaakov, in spite of his having received more assurances ‎from G’d than either his father or grandfather. Ed.]‎</small><br>Whereas Avraham, after having had his name changed, is ‎never again referred to as Avram, and according to <i>halachah</i> ‎it is inadmissible for us nowadays to refer to him by his original ‎name, Yaakov received an “additional” name, his original name ‎not having been uprooted and the prophets throughout the ‎generations repeatedly referring to him by that name. The fact ‎that he was able to sire all the 12 tribes before having had the ‎name Yisrael added to his name, is proof that his name change ‎was of a different kind from that of Avram’s becoming Avraham. ‎Yaakov’s combining the attributes of ‎חסד‎ and ‎גבורה‎, did not need ‎to be renamed for the sake of achieving ‎צמצום‎, voluntary ‎restriction of some of his natural initiatives. When the angel ‎informed him that henceforth the name Israel would be added to ‎his original name (Genesis 32,28) this was in recognition of ‎Yaakov’s ability to function on both “wavelengths, i.e. he could ‎keep in check his tendency to practice ‎חסד‎ as well as his tendency ‎to be in awe of G’d, ‎גבורה, דין‎ as the occasion demanded. We can ‎best understand this when picturing a father who, when ‎displaying his love for a young child, has to keep in check that ‎this intellect tells him that he is wasting valuable time “playing,” ‎during which he could perform other tasks whose usefulness ‎would be apparent to all. By knowing when to use the instrument ‎of <i>tzimtzum</i>, he pleases the Creator so much that the ‎prophet Isaiah 49,3 quotes G’d as saying of Israel: ‎ישראל אשר בך ‏אתפאר‎, “Israel through you I am glorified.” <small>[I have occasionally ‎paraphrased the author’s words in the preceding paragraph. Ed.]‎‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 23_Paragraph": "Yet another interpretation of Malki Tzedek’s blessing of ‎Avram: We must try and understand the sequence of “blessed be ‎Avram to the Supreme G’d, the owner of heaven and earth, and ‎blessed this Supreme G’d Who acted as shield against your ‎oppressors delivering them into your hand.” When Malki Tzedek ‎refers to G’d as owning heaven and earth, we paraphrase this ‎three times a day in our prayers by referring to G’d as ‎קונה הכל‎, ‎‎“He Who owns everything.”<br><small>[If I understand the author ‎correctly, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok proceeds at this stage at quite ‎some length and quoting many verses from Scripture, to explain ‎why Malki Tzedek’s definition of G’d as (separately) owning ‎heaven and earth may be misunderstood and has not been ‎adopted by the sages in our daily prayers who opted instead for ‎‎“owning everything.”<br>Malki Tzedek’s definition contributed to ‎man believing that there were forces on earth, which though ‎subordinate to G’d, the “Supreme G’d”, nonetheless deserved a ‎measure of man’s fearful or grateful recognition, as the case may ‎be. If G’d tolerated this prior to Avram’s becoming a factor on ‎earth, He did so out of the goodness of His heart, realizing that ‎these visible phenomena, as opposed to His invisibility, ‎contributed to man’s errors in his perception of Who is Who in ‎the universal hierarchy.

        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 3_Paragraph": "This is what the <i>Midrash</i> had in mind when it ‎interpreted the opening words of our chapter ‎ואברהם זקן בא בימים‎, ‎to mean that prior to the existence of Avraham there had not ‎been a concept on earth known as ‎זקנה‎, “old age,” i.e. G’d’s ‎largesse flowing directly, without detour through nature, to any ‎human being. The reason was simple. No human being had ‎accumulated the kind of merits that enabled G’d to direct this ‎flow of largesse by bypassing normal channels. Avraham’s merits ‎had opened new channels of communication between G’d and ‎man.‎<br>At this point the author refers to a method of writing the 72-‎lettered “name” of <i>Hashem</i> in 9 columns of 8 three lettered ‎words, using Exodus 14,19,20 and 21, respectively, (each verse ‎having 72 letters) and consecutively, and the middle verse in by ‎reading it from left to right, so that you get the diagram ‎shown.<br>In that diagram you will note that in the top row the ‎‎“name” spelled ‎סיט‎ appears in the column preceding the one ‎commencing with a name consisting of ‎עלמ‎.<br><small>[I am attaching ‎the diagram so that you, the reader can better visualize what the ‎author is speaking about. Ed.]</small><br>The word ‎סיט‎ occurs on several ‎occasions in the Mishnah, throughout the section known as ‎‎<i>taharot</i> as a vessel used in measuring. (Maimonides on ‎‎<i>Keylim</i> 13,4, <i>Orlah</i>, 3,2 for instance) This “name” of ‎G’d serves as symbol of Avraham’s ability to channel G’d’s largesse ‎from the celestial domains to our regions. The next column in our ‎diagram is headed by the letters ‎עלמ‎, [alluding to our ‎עולם‎, world] ‎and symbolizes for our purposes, the manner of distribution of ‎this largesse once it has entered the sphere of the material world. ‎We refer to this in our daily <i>amidah</i> prayer when we recite ‎the words: ‎וזוכר חסדי אבות ומביא גואל לבני בניהם‎. “He (G’d) ‎remembers the deeds of loving kindness of the patriarchs and ‎brings the redeemer to their children’s children.” On the face of ‎it, it is difficult to understand the words ‎חסדי אבות‎, “the pious ‎deeds performed by the patriarchs.” All the author of this ‎paragraph had to mention was ‎וזוכר אבות‎, that “G’d remembers ‎the patriarchs.” Furthermore, why would the author of this ‎paragraph refer to the redemption as being brought to the ‎‎“children’s children” of the patriarchs? It would have sufficed to ‎refer to their ‎בניהם‎, “children.” When speaking of fathers, it is ‎customary to relate to their children rather than to their ‎grandchildren. However, when understanding the entire ‎paragraph and what it teaches in light of what we have explained, ‎both the word “‎חסדי‎” and the words “‎לבני בניהם‎” make perfect ‎sense, as the author draws our attention to the manner in which ‎G’d’s largesse is transmitted to the Jewish people and who we ‎have to thank for this. The ‎חסד‎ of which the author speaks is an ‎allusion to the “source” of the largesse, i.e. G’d Himself, (not ‎nature) whereas the ‎בני בניהם‎, is an allusion to the meritorious ‎deeds of the patriarchs which paved the way for the Jewish ‎people to receive G’d’s largesse directly, without ‎detours.<br>When the paragraph above is introduced with the ‎words: ‎ואברהם זקן בא בימים וה' ברך את אברהם בכל‎, this is an ‎allusion to Avraham, the first of the patriarchs having been able ‎to open the sluices of G’d’s treasure chamber to enable the flow of ‎its goodness to bypass regular channels and flow directly to His ‎people. When G’d’s largesse flows to us in this manner, it is not ‎limited in measure at all, as it would be if it had to reach us via ‎nature.<br>This is the meaning of <i>bereshit rabbah</i> 59,5 ‎where the author writes: Avraham would bless everybody. ‎‎(Compare Genesis 12,3) To the question whence Avraham was ‎able to do so, i.e. who had blessed him first? The answer is that ‎G’d personally, had done so in His capacity of ‎רצון‎ as explained on ‎page 118.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 24_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎21,6. <b>“G’d has made laughter for me.”</b> Sarah realized that if ‎G’d had granted her children in her old age instead of during her ‎child-bearing years, He had multiplied the joy she experienced by ‎this birth. Had she given birth in her younger years the ‎pregnancy and subsequent birth would have been periods of ‎discomfort and pain for her. Now, that she had not become ‎pregnant until she was close to 90 years old, every day of that ‎pregnancy had been filled with joyful expectation, and even the ‎birth itself was not felt by her as an excruciatingly painful ‎experience. Instead of thanking G’d in His capacity as ‎‎<i>Hashem</i>, as we might have expected, she thanked Him in ‎His capacity as ‎אלוקים‎, the attribute of Justice, realizing that ‎during all the years she had felt deprived of the joys of ‎motherhood, the attribute of Justice seemingly being applied to ‎her, had enabled her to exult in joy at this time.‎<br>This feeling of Sarah is reflected in psalms 118,21:‎אודך כי עניתני ‏ותהי לי לישועה‎, “I wish to thank You, for You have afflicted ‎me/answered me. For through my affliction my salvation has ‎come.” The same thought is repeated in a different nuance, when ‎David continues (verse 22) ‎אבן מאסו הבונים היתה לראש פנה‎, “the ‎stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.” ‎David adds, that it has become clear to him that all of this had ‎been planned by G’d in advance, i.e. (verse 23) ‎מאת ה' היתה זאת היא ‏נפלאת בעינינו‎, “this is the Lord’s doing; it is marvelous in our ‎eyes.” David too, is aware that it is far more rewarding to ‎experience these blessings from G’d in one’s mature years than in ‎one’s early youth. When a youth experiences all these blessings, ‎he does not even recognize them as blessing bestowed by G’d, but ‎credits them to chance or other circumstances. Having ‎experienced G’d’s salvation at a relatively late stage in one’s life ‎makes one doubly grateful to <i>Hashem</i>, i.e. ‎זה היום עשה ה' ‏נגילה ונשמחה בו‎, “this is the day that the Lord has made, let us ‎exult and rejoice on it.”‎<br>When examining the manner in which G’d shares out His ‎largesse, we must distinguish between two categories of ‎recipients. One category enjoys the material benefits provided by ‎‎<i>Hashem</i> for what they are worth, i.e. they consider the ‎material part as the essential part, not considering them as a ‎means to an end. The second category of recipients are the sages ‎and the pious people who perceive these “gifts” as proof of the ‎caring supervision exercised by G’d over all of His creatures, and ‎they see in it an encouragement to never forget that there is a ‎benevolent King Who rules over us. This is what David referred to ‎when he said in the above-quoted hymn:‎זה היום עשה ה' נגילה ‏ונשמחה בו‎, “this is the day that the Lord has made let us rejoice ‎and be happy in Him.” They see in the word ‎בו‎ at the end of this ‎verse a reference to G’d, not to the day.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 17_Paragraph": "Let us proceed to explain the nature of the blessing Yitzchok ‎bestowed on Yaakov. We must remember that he thought that he ‎was blessing Esau. The wording of the blessing reflects evaluations ‎in the celestial spheres. In order to understand this better, ‎compare the Talmud in <i>Pessachim</i> 118 where psalms 118,1 ‎הודו לה' כי טוב כי לעולם חסדו‎, “Praise the Lord for He is good, for ‎His loving kindness lasts forever;” this is understood by Rav ‎Chisda as the goodness of G’d being displayed in the manner in ‎which He applies punishment for the same sin by exacting ‎retribution from the sinner only relative to his economic ability, ‎i.e. He may punish a wealthy man by depriving him of his ox, ‎whereas he may deprive a poor man only of a lamb, though both ‎committed the same sin. The principle we must constantly keep ‎in front of our eyes is spelled out in <i>B’rachot</i> 60: “whatever ‎G’d initiates is for the benefit of His creatures.” Being only ‎human, we cannot always recognize that what befalls us is ‎actually for our own good. Even when it is quite obviously a ‎setback to our aspirations, we must remember that when these ‎setbacks are retributions for sins committed, designed to preserve ‎our claim to an afterlife intact, the retribution itself is tailored to ‎our individual circumstances ensuring that we will not collapse ‎under their burden.‎<br>The same rule applies in reverse. Sometimes we experience ‎what we consider a stroke of good luck, and we may even thank ‎the Lord for this “stroke of good luck.” This does not mean that ‎this very “stroke of good luck,” does not constitute a challenge ‎even more difficult to deal with than a “stroke of bad luck.” ‎Eventually, we may trace reverses we experience in life to the ‎very stroke of “good luck,” such as winning a lottery. Had we not ‎won that lottery, dissent within the family, envy and jealousy ‎might never have reared their head within our family. The ‎overriding element that a true believer in <i>Hashem</i> must ‎never lose sight of is that G’d did not give Satan unlimited ‎powers, and that whatever difficulties he puts in our path must ‎be geared to our ability to overcome it, if only we exert ourselves ‎to the fullest extent.‎<br>We know that Yitzchok’s predominant characteristic was the ‎aspect of G’d called ‎מידת הדין‎, attribute of Justice. Esau, on the ‎other hand, personified the perennial accuser, Satan, whereas ‎Yaakov personified virtues of the Jewish people. When preparing ‎to bless his son Esau, (as he thought he was doing) Yitzchok had ‎to tailor his blessing to the power of retribution, Satan. (Compare ‎‎<i>Baba batra</i> 16). When G’d gives the attribute of Justice the ‎green light to punish human beings, this means that he allows ‎Satan free reign for a time. By withdrawing, hiding His ‎benevolence from the people being punished, He is actually doing ‎them a favour. When Yitzchok proceeded to bless Esau, he had ‎intended to empower the forces that mete out retribution on ‎earth; having been unaware that the son facing him was Yaakov, ‎who instead of empowering retribution was concerned only with ‎what was manifestly good for Israel. This was an example of ‎everything that G’d does being for the ultimate good. Yaakov too ‎had not realized the true motivation of Yitzchok in wanting to ‎bestow a blessing on Esau at that time not having been aware of ‎the type of blessing Yitzchok intended to bestow on him. ‎‎<small>[All three (not counting Rivkah) parties involved in the ‎blessing were unaware of pertinent facts before undertaking a ‎potentially fateful step. Ed.]</small>‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 27_Paragraph": "Alternately, the reason this prayer is called ‎מנחה‎, is because ‎we express our unworthiness for all the goodness G’d bestows ‎upon us whether as ‎חסד‎, an act of loving kindness as understood ‎by Avraham, or as ‎רחמים‎ as understood by Yaakov. Since G’d does ‎not only shower us with His goodness in the morning and in the ‎evening, but even during every moment of every day, we owe it ‎to Him to consider this as a great gift from Him, and therefore we ‎acknowledge this at a time of day when we are otherwise ‎preoccupied.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 39_Paragraph": "<i>Rashi</i> explains that G’d took the Jewish people out of ‎Egypt in order for them to inherit it by arriving there. Their ‎arrival in the land constitutes their achieving their objective, ‎שלימות‎, much as the branches of the tree producing fruit achieve ‎their objective. In Leviticus 25,38 we read: ‎הוצאתי אתכם מארץ מצרים ‏לתת לכם את ארץ כנען להיות לכם לאלוקים‎, “I have taken you out of the ‎land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan to become your ‎G’d.” According to our author, <i>Rashi</i> explains the words ‎לתת לכם‎, as “in order for you to achieve your ‎שלימות‎, maturity ‎there by performing My commandments.” According to <i>Baba ‎Batra</i> 158 the very air of the Holy Land confers wisdom on its ‎people. The reason why even walking in the Holy Land <small>[by ‎Israelites, of course, Ed.]</small> adds to one’s wisdom is illustrated by an ‎example of Rabbi Zeyrah who left Babylon in order to settle in the ‎Holy Land again, changed his mind on a <i>Halachic</i> point ‎involving the laws of inheritance, accepting the view of a local ‎scholar, whereas a sage who moved from the land of Israel, ‎adopted the former view of Rabbi Zeyrah when he came to ‎Babylon.<br>Since the generation who left Egypt as adults did not ‎get to the land of Israel, only their sons, it follows that the ‎parents did not achieve their ‎שלימות‎, “maturity” until their sons ‎had made the Land of Israel their ancestral heritage. This is the ‎meaning of “the dead inherited the living.”<br>This statement in ‎the Talmud about the dead inheriting the living, also explains ‎another statement in the Talmud <i>Sanhedrin</i> 104, according ‎to which a son <small>[while alive Ed.]</small> can confer spiritual merits on his ‎‎[deceased] father, whereas his deceased father cannot confer ‎merits on his surviving son. The Talmud bases this on the ‎example of the second generation of the Israelites bestowing ‎merits on their fathers after they carried out the task set by G’d ‎for this people of settling in the Holy land and observing the ‎Torah there. Avraham after his death, or Yitzchok, after his ‎death, could not confer merits on their respective sons that these ‎had not acquired during their respective lifetimes.", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 21_Paragraph": "Genesis 27,38. <b>“do you really have only one blessing ‎that you can dispense, my father?</b>;While there is a rule ‎that life as well as blessings originate from one holy source, this ‎rule brings in its wake the possibility that the “left” side of the ‎emanations can also be the seat of life, as when G’d created the ‎universe He arranged that the forces of evil and those of good be ‎at par with one another least on the surface. <small>[Otherwise ‎freedom of choice granted to man would be meaningless. ‎Ed.]</small> Both the <i>Ari z’al</i> and others preceding him, ‎including <i>Rashi</i>, stated that holiness is also known as ‎אחת‎, ‎‎“a state of unity.” <i>Rashi</i> points out that when the ‎descendants of Yaakov set out on their journey to Egypt and ‎their names had been listed individually, the Torah (Genesis ‎‎46,27) concluded the list with ‎כל הנפש‎, “the sum total of the ‎soul,” (singular) when referring to this family.

Such nuances ‎in the Torah reveal to us that not all souls originate in the same ‎region of the diagram portraying the emanations.‎<br>When Esau, at this point questions his father if he has only ‎ברכה אתת‎, he asks whether his father cannot dispense a blessing ‎for people whose origin is not in the holy section of the ‎emanations, the section known as ‎אחת‎. He feels, that surely ‎seeing that he is his father’s son, his father must also be able to ‎have reserved a blessing for him! By asking this question he ‎contradicted the words of his father who had told him that the ‎blessing he had already bestowed on Yaakov that made him senior ‎to his older brother, i.e. ‎הוה גביר לאחיך‎, made this impossible. If he ‎were to give Esau a similar blessing he would in effect deprive ‎Yaakov of the blessing he had just given him. When Yitzchok ‎heard what Esau demanded of him, seeing that he had told him ‎that in his blessing he had made Yaakov the senior of the two, he ‎realized the full extent of Esau’s wickedness, and that is why he ‎added, now, without reservation, ‎גם ברוך יהיה‎, “he shall also ‎remain blessed!” Up until that moment Yitzchok had not realized ‎that Esau was a product of the ‎סטרא אחרא‎, the “left side” of the ‎scheme of emanations. Having found that out, he now gave Esau ‎a blessing that was in keeping with the “blessings” perceived as ‎such by souls that originate in that realm, i.e. ‎על חרבך תחיה‎, ‎‎“seeing that you are loyal to the principle that might is right,” ‎the principle espoused by people whose souls originate in the left ‎side of the emanations, people who believe in the survival of the ‎fittest, Yitzchok could only bless his son Esau by wishing him ‎‎“success” (death) when he would be involved in such lethal ‎encounters. He meant it in the sense that “until you pay the ‎price with your physical life you will not be able to secure for ‎yourself any life in the hereafter”. When such people lose their ‎lives when engaged in what they perceive as a “holy” war, they ‎may redeem themselves and secure life in the hereafter. ‎‎<small>[This editor has often wondered it the concept of our ‎sages of a Mashiach ben Yoseph, a messiah who will die in battle ‎before the advent of the Mashiach ben David, the ultimate ‎redeemer, may not originate among the gentiles and earn his ‎right to his hereafter in the manner just described. Ed.]</small>‎<br>Genesis 27,40. Let us turn now to the next part of Yitzchok’s ‎‎“blessing” to Easu, the words ‎והיה כאשר תריד ופרקת עולו מעל ‏צוארך‎, <b>“but when you humble yourself you will be able to ‎remove the his yoke from around your neck.”</b> ‎‎<br>According to Or <i>Hachayim</i> on our verse the word ‎והיה‎ in ‎the above verse is to be interpreted as a form of joy, ‎שמחה‎. ‎Contrary to the accepted translation of this line, <i>Rashi</i> ‎understands the word ‎תריד‎, as “when you will suffer pain.” ‎According to Proverbs 11,10 ‎באבוד רשעים רנה‎ “when the wicked ‎perish there is jubilation.” Isaiah 1,3 speaks about the ox ‎recognizing his owner. The fact is that when the ox wears a yoke ‎he does not recognize (in the sense of welcoming) his master ‎voluntarily, but only because he is forced to wear a yoke. When ‎the yoke is removed he will honour his master by still respecting ‎and welcoming him. Something parallel occurs in history about ‎the Israel/Esau relationship. As long as the Temple in Jerusalem ‎was standing, the gentile nations paid reluctant respect to the ‎Jewish people. Nowadays, when there is no longer a Temple in ‎Jerusalem, the yoke which had restrained the Gentiles has been ‎lifted from them, although their obligation, as a free willed ‎creature created in the image of G’d to respect G’d’s people has ‎not been lessened. G’d, after all, created this universe only for the ‎sake of His people, the Jewish people. According to Isaiah 40,17 ‎כל ‏האומות כעין נגדו מאפס ותוהו נחשבו לו‎, “All nations are as naught in ‎His sight; He accounts them as less than nothing.” This is in ‎essence what Yitzchok told Esau when he said ‎ופרקתו עולו מעל ‏צווארך‎, “even when you will divest yourself of the yoke of Yaakov, ‎in times when the Jewish people are in exile, as Rashi explains, ‎you will only remove this yoke from your neck, i.e. temporarily ‎during the time Israel is in exile, but inherently, your duty ‎toward G’d, whose representative on earth the Jewish people are, ‎will continue, just as an ox knows his master regardless if he is ‎restrained by a physical yoke or not.” Upon hearing this, Esau ‎raised his voice and wept, feeling frustrated that his father would ‎not give him a blessing that would neutralize the one he had ‎given to Yaakov. He had fully understood all the implications of ‎the few words Yitzchok had said to him.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 16_Paragraph": "Another aspect of Eliezer’s refusal to commence eating before ‎explaining the purpose of his journey to Aram Naharayim: Eliezer ‎was aware of the wicked nature of his hosts, and considered it ‎likely that they had put poison in his food in order to not only ‎murder him, but to rob him of the generous dowry his ten camels ‎had been carrying. In the event, he was proven correct, as we no ‎longer hear a word about Rivkah’s father Betuel when Rivkah ‎departs on the following day, since apparently he had eaten of ‎the poisoned food. Eliezer’s speech is considered by our sages as ‎so important, that they do not only consider his words as equal to ‎‎<i>divrey Torah</i>, words of Torah, but add that the Torah ‎deliberately devoted more space to what appear to be mundane ‎matters discussed by Avraham’s servant, than it devotes to words ‎of Torah spoken by the patriarchs themselves. He was spared ‎death by poisoning due to his timely words, which afforded an ‎angel the opportunity to switch his plate with that of his host ‎Betuel, who died from the effects of poisoning during the ‎following night. (<i>Bereshit Rabba</i>h, 60,12) According to that ‎Midrash, Rivkah’s mother and brother wanted to use the ‎mourning period for Betuel to delay Rivkah’s departure.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 13_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎18,17.‎‎ <b>“and the Lord had said: ‘shall I conceal from ‎Avraham….seeing that I have singled him out, that he may ‎instruct his children and his posterity to keep the way of the ‎Lord by doing what is just and right in order that the Lord ‎may bring about for Avraham what He has promised ‎him;”</b><br>Why does the Torah write twice: ‎למען‎, “in order that, ‎etc,” in this verse? There are numerous additional details in this ‎verse which I do not wish to dwell on at this time due to their ‎requiring lengthy answers.<br>Basically, the root of the problem ‎G’d is addressing here is that the verse addresses the ‎righteousness of Avraham seeing that all of Avraham’s devoted ‎service to G’d originated in his love for G’d and his outstanding ‎intellect. Due to his outstanding intellect, he realized that ‎whatever he had done was very little compared to the vast ‎amount of loving attention and miracles G’d had already ‎showered upon him at various times in his life. As a result, ‎Avraham did not for a moment consider that he had reciprocated ‎sufficiently for what G’d had done for him. When pondering this ‎dilemma, Avraham realized that the only way in which he could ‎improve the quality of his service of the Lord was by being ‎instrumental in getting others to follow his example. As long as ‎he was not able to accomplish this to the extent he hoped for, he ‎decided to view his service to G’d as being performed also on ‎behalf of the entire Jewish people. He knew that it is within the ‎power of someone given the title ‎אב‎, “father,” or better, ‎‎“patriarch,” to act as the High Priest of others in his service of ‎the Lord. Having realized this, he not only intensified the ‎performance of the Torah’s commandments that his intellect had ‎convinced him would be part of the text of the Torah when it ‎would be revealed, but he even understood what kind of ‎safeguards the sages would surround Torah laws with in order to ‎insure that Biblical laws would not be violated by the Israelites in ‎the future.<br>When the sages tell us that Avraham even ‎observed the <i>halachah</i> of ‎ערוב תבשילין‎, (<i>Yuma</i> 28) ‎precautionary preparation of food for the Sabbath following ‎immediately after a festival, they merely wanted to illustrate that ‎these laws were based on application of intelligence, and the ‎sages’ ability to divine the reasons behind the basic legislation. ‎How else would Avraham have been inspired to think of this? The ‎sages chose this example to illustrate Avraham’s performance of ‎the commandments, as when we nowadays, perform this ‎commandment, we include in our benediction a statement that ‎includes all of the people in our town as being included in our ‎having performed this commandment. This Rabbinic ordinance ‎has remained an illustration of how easy it is to include others in ‎the performance of G’d’s commandments by having them in mind ‎and acting as a branch of the tree planted by the first Jew, ‎Avraham.", 
        "1_Genesis, 6_Vayetzei, 0_Paragraph": "Genesis 28,10. <b>“Yaakov left Beer Sheva, etc.;”</b> ‎‎<small>[I presume the connection to Chanukah the author makes ‎here is based on his having composed this commentary for a ‎Shabbat Chanukah sermon. Ed.]</small>‎‎<br>The reason why the miracle of Chanukah, actually the ‎miracle of the cruse of oil, is popularly known as the “miracle of ‎Chanukah,” is due to the word ‎חנוכה‎, being a derivative of ‎חנוך‎, ‎‎“consecration.” We find in Exodus 29,33 in connection with the ‎consecration of the priestly garments, that before the priests ‎were allowed to perform their sacred service they had to be ‎provided with suitable vessels to be used, i.e. priestly garments. ‎Wearing these priestly garments was so important that if they ‎performed their duties improperly dressed (even missing one of ‎these garments) this was a cardinal sin. (Maimonides 10,4 ‎‎<i>hilchot kley hamikdash</i>) The container in which certain ‎offerings were presented, were as integral a part of the ritual as ‎the ritual itself. The garments are the “container” in which the ‎priestly body performs his sacred task. It or they, are viewed like a ‎חנוך‎, educational tool, consecration, that must precede the actual ‎ritual in order for the priest to be truly a priest.<br>‎‎<small>[Possibly, the emphasis on this in connection with the ‎priests especially, is due to the fact that the priest was born to ‎his status, and it would have been most unseemly for him not to ‎undergo preparations before fulfilling his sacred tasks. Rabbis ‎might not need this, as they were not born to the Rabbinate but ‎had to study and pass exams before being granted their titles, ‎ordination. Ed.]</small><br>‎Children are trained to perform the commandments before ‎becoming legally of age, i.e. ‎בר מצוה‎ or ‎בת מצוה‎, as the case may ‎be, before being ushered into adulthood and all that this entails.‎‎<br>Our patriarch Yaakov had contemplated the awesome ‎fact of the Unity of G’d from the day he was able to think, and he ‎realized that the foundation of all parts of the universe was the ‎Jewish people, i.e. if there were to be no Jewish people, G’d’s work ‎of creating the universe would have been in vain.‎<br>Zohar I,24 (and elsewhere) states that ‎ישראל עלה במחשבה ‏בראשית‎, “the eventual existence of the Jewish people was the first ‎thought that G’d entertained when contemplating the creation of ‎this universe.” Numerous scriptural verses are quoted in support ‎of this statement, one of which that concerns us especially being ‎that Israel was also known as ‎אבן‎ as in “foundation stone,” seeing ‎that the entire universe emerged from that origin. The Jewish ‎people therefore are not only the “root” of mankind, but also in ‎no lesser degree the founders of the celestial regions. While still in ‎the stage of being only a thought in G’d’s mind, they were called ‎אבן‎, “rock” in the singular mode, as at that point the true unity ‎of the Jewish people and what they represent could be found.‎<br>Our ancestor Yaakov attempted with all the intellectual and ‎emotional powers at his disposal to unravel the secrets of these ‎concepts in order to convert Israel’s potential into an actual. As ‎per Genesis 49,24 he wanted ‎משם רועה אבן ישראל‎, “to lay the ‎foundation stone of Israel,” as the shepherd of a nation consisting ‎of 12 tribes that parallel the 12 bisections of the 6 sides of the ‎cube when the universe is portrayed as a cube, dividing it into 12 ‎triangles (compare <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>, “Book of creation”) by ‎bisecting each side from corner to corner. Each of the tribes of ‎the Jewish people represents one of these “triangles.” In order for ‎the celestial <i>merkavah</i>, Divine chariot, to be complete it ‎must be comprised of 600000 components, the number of Jewish ‎male adults that were redeemed from bondage in Egypt. ‎According to our sages, the Presence of the <i>Shechinah</i> will ‎not manifest itself as resting above the Jewish people when they ‎number less than these 600000. According to our author, when ‎the Torah in Genesis 28,11 describes how Yaakov took “stones” in ‎order to prepare to spend the night, and he put his head on of ‎the stones to serve as his “pillow,” the Torah merely illustrates ‎the kind of thoughts that preoccupied Yaakov at that time, and ‎how during his “dream” of the ladder he experienced Divine ‎insights that had never been revealed to him.<br>Nonetheless, in view of the sages having said that no verse in ‎the Torah must be explained in a way that departs completely ‎from the written text and its plain meaning, we must pay ‎attention to this also. <small>[I believe that in accordance with the above ‎Yaakov/Yisrael’s role as ‎רועה אבן ישראל‎, “shepherd of the nucleus ‎of the people” of Israel began here. Ed.]‎‎</small><br>According to the plain text there is no question that Yaakov ‎placed his head on real stones, as he had no softer pillow at hand. ‎Nonetheless while lying with these rocks as his pillow, he thought ‎of matters far beyond his immediate and pressing terrestrial ‎concerns. Perhaps this very fact qualified him for experiencing ‎the first of his many Divine visions, although this time he was not ‎certain for 34 years that it had indeed been a divine vision. ‎According to our sages, during this night Yaakov’s mind foresaw ‎the ruins of two Temples and the great anger that the Jewish ‎people, his descendants, would provoke in G’d’s mind on ‎numerous occasions.", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 29_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎24,67. <b>“Yitzchok brought Rivkah into the tent of his ‎mother Sarah, and he wed her and she became his wife and ‎he loved her.”</b> We need to examine what the Torah meant by ‎Yitzchok loving Rivkah that is so extraordinary that it has to be ‎spelled out here.<br>A husband can love his wife on two different ‎levels. He may love her, i.e. be physically attracted to her as she ‎enables him to satisfy his biological urges. If this is his “love,” it is ‎not love at all, but is merely love of his self. There are husbands ‎who do not love their wives because they are instruments of ‎fulfilling their physical desires, but because their wives enable ‎them to perform their Creator’s will better and more profoundly. ‎This is the true meaning of “someone loving his wife.” The Torah ‎testifies that Yitzchok’s love for Rivkah was of the latter category.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 6_Vayetzei, 1_Paragraph": " The words: ‎וילך חרנה‎, according to this ‎method of interpretation allude to the future when G’d would ‎become angry with His people. The words: ‎ויצא יעקב‎, would ‎contrast this with his leaving the domain from which G’d ‎dispenses all His goodness for His creatures, especially the Jewish ‎people. All this caused him great anguish and when the Torah ‎describes his ‎ויפגע במקום וילן שם כי בא השמש‎, “that he met ‎‎<i>hamakom</i> and had to spend the night there as the sun had ‎set,” this is a simile for Yaakov foreseeing how the fortunes of the ‎Jewish people would turn from having enjoyed G’d’s bounty to ‎not only becoming persecuted but also causing G’d to share the ‎pain that He had been forced to inflict upon His people. The ‎darkness alluded to in this verse describes that his vision became ‎so clouded worrying about how G’d must suffer when His favorite ‎people stray so far from the path of Torah that they must ‎undergo harsh punishments in order to bring them back to the ‎right path.‎<br>When the Torah describes Yaakov as ‎ויקח מאבני המקום‎, “he ‎took from the stones of <i>hamakom&gt;</i>,” this describes Yaakov’s ‎sharing G’d’s pain and wishing to be able to compensate G’d for ‎this in same way. (Alluded to by the word ‎ויפגע‎). The words ‎מאבני ‏המקום וישם מראשותיו‎, “from the stones of <i>hamakom</i> and he ‎placed them under his head,” suggest how Yaakov tried to share ‎G’d’s “pain” at what both He and His people would have to ‎endure in exile. His whole thinking was preoccupied with how he ‎could somehow if not forestall these happenings at least ensure ‎that his descendants would survive these experiences. This is the ‎key to his dream of the ladder that follows. It portrays that ‎Yaakov had found a means to deal with the physical implications ‎of exile and persecutions because of Whom He saw on the top of ‎the ladder. This helped him console himself that all of these harsh ‎experiences would be confined to Israel’s existence in the “lower” ‎regions of the universe. The words: ‎וראשו מגיע השמימה‎, “the ‎ladder’s top reached into heaven,” reminds Yaakov that exile ‎also touches the celestial spheres, so much so that its impact ‎affects those regions negatively. Its most direct impact on the ‎celestial regions is that it interferes with the dispensation of G’d’s ‎largesse to mankind, and the forces of nature upon which man ‎depends.<br>The line: ‎והנה מלאכי אלוקים עולים ויורדים בו‎, “and behold ‎G’d’s angels were ascending and descending on that ladder,” ‎is the message that even exile has its positive aspects, as it ‎enables numerous “sparks” that had previously “fallen” from the ‎tree that we perceive as the <i>Shechinah</i>, to find their way ‎back to their holy origin. At the same time, regretfully, the ‎descent of the Jewish people into exile brings with it a parallel ‎descent of some other “sparks” from the <i>Shechinah</i> into the ‎ritually contaminated part of the universe. In our verse these ‎‎“sparks” are referred to as ‎מלאכי אלוקים‎, “Angels of the Divine.” ‎Presiding over all these happenings is G’d, ‎והנה ה' נצב עליו‎, “and ‎behold the Lord is standing above it;” this line also reassures ‎Yaakov that wherever he may find himself he will not be alone, as ‎G’d Himself accompanies him even in exile. Moses confirms this in ‎psalms 91,15 when he says (quoting G’d) “I will be with him in ‎distress.” Seeing that the Lord is with us, our real “pain” or ‎sorrow is really G’d’s pain and sorrow.‎‎<br>As soon as G’d saw that Yaakov’s concern was with His pain ‎and sorrow, and how all this would impact on the foundation of ‎the Jewish people and its development, He reassured him that he ‎was the same G’d Who had looked after Avraham and Yitzchok, ‎his respective grandfather and father. He assured him that this ‎same piece of earth on which he was lying at this time, i.e. that ‎he is so worried about, He, the Lord will give to him and to his ‎descendants and that his descendants will spread out to all the ‎corners of the earth. He continues to reassure Yaakov that during ‎all the vicissitudes of history that his descendants would endure, ‎He would always keep a benevolent eye on them. They will, in due ‎course, return from exile to a brighter future.‎<br>Genesis 28,16. <b>“Yaakov awakened from his dream, ‎etc;”</b> the word ‎משנתו‎, here is a reference to the mental state ‎of depression under which Yaakov had laboured when ‎contemplating the exile his descendants would experience in the ‎future. When he says: ‎אכן יש ה' במקום הזה ואנכי לא ידעתי‎, “indeed ‎the Lord is even in this place and I did not know it,” is an ‎acknowledgment that he had unnecessarily despaired of the ‎future of his people thinking that G’d would forsake them in ‎exile. Having realized now that he had been wrong, filled him ‎with such gratitude that he determined to build a Temple on the ‎site where this insight had been revealed to him. The words: ‎בית ‏אלוקים‎, as something already in place, allegorically speaking, ‎refers to his realization that once there is a Jewish people G’d will ‎never again withdraw from the lower regions of the universe as ‎He had done previously when man’s conduct had become too ‎offensive.‎‎<small>[I believe the principal lesson Yaakov learned in this ‎dream (as portrayed by the author) was that even when Moses ‎speaks clearly in the Torah about G’d “hiding His face,” (Deut. ‎‎31,18) this does not refer to His withdrawing from our part of the ‎world; it only means that we will be under the impression that He ‎has done so as we see no evidence of His Presence overtly or ‎covertly. Ed.]</small> If this is the lesson of exile, exile itself ‎becomes a truly positive experience.‎<br>At this stage Yaakov reverts to his original intention of taking ‎the “stones” or “stone” i.e. the foundation stone of the Jewish ‎people and converts it from a potential tool into an actual by ‎consecrating it with oil. <small>[The Jewish people no less than ‎the Temple are perceived as “Temples,” the former as a living ‎entity, the latter as an inert structure always on a sacred site. ‎Ed.]</small> ‎‎<small>[The significance of oil for consecration, and the ‎miracle of Chanukah being the miracle of the cruse of holy oil as ‎having been foreshadowed in Yaakov’s dream signaling the end of ‎desecration of the Holy Temple, has thus been established. ‎Although some of the words are mine, I trust that I have ‎conveyed our author’s meaning. Ed.]</small>‎<br> This is the first time in the Torah that “oil” is portrayed as ‎possessing spiritually elevating potential. Normally, we are ‎familiar with this only from when the priests who were anointed ‎with oil, or when a King, first in a dynasty, was consecrated with ‎it. Yaakov understood the mystical properties contained in such ‎oil (holy oil) and used it here for the first time as such.‎<br>‎[One wonders at the fact that although Yaakov appears to ‎have been stripped of all valuables prior to this night, he still had ‎some such oil on his person; this makes the connection the ‎author establishes between Chanukah and Yaakov’s dream of the ‎ladder a great deal more plausible. Ed.]‎‎<br> <i>Reshit Chochma</i>, <i>shaar ahavah</i> section 5,39, ‎שמן‎, oil, i.e. the resin found in trees, is a euphemism for wisdom ‎originating in the celestial regions. By means of this wisdom G’d ‎used a combination of this wisdom and sanctity to produce a ‎unique product, the foundation stone of the Jewish people ‎preparing from this an entire building containing many “rooms” ‎one of which was reserved for G’d to manifest Himself therein to ‎His people exclusively. When speaking of “His people,” we refer ‎to the spiritualized concept of the Jewish people, described by our ‎sages as ‎כנסת ישראל‎, “the collective soul of the Jewish people.” ‎This is what the Torah had in mind when it reports Yaakov as ‎saying:  ‎ויקרא את שם המקום ההוא ביתאל‎, “he called the name ‎of this site <i>Betel</i>;” the Torah adds that ‎ואולם לוז שם העיר ‏לראשונה‎, “originally the name of the town had been Looz.” ‎‎(Verse 20) By mentioning this detail, the Torah wishes to inform ‎the reader that even before Yaakov spent a night at this location ‎all the basic ingredients for the site to be elevated to one of ‎sanctity had already existed as a potential. This was so because ‎the concept of a Jewish nation, as mentioned previously, was not ‎new, in fact it had been in G’ds mind before He even began to ‎create the universe. This concept did not only include the ‎formation of a Jewish nation, but envisaged its history right to ‎the point when the Messiah would redeem this people from its ‎last exile. According to tradition (<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 69, ‎discussed at length) the human body contains a bone known as ‎לוז‎, which is indestructible, the angel of death having no power ‎over it, and conversely, it is also the bone from which all other ‎parts of the human body develop. <small>[Not necessarily a ‎‎“bone” as we understand it, but possibly what we call a stem cell ‎in our time. Ed.]</small> The “stem cell” ‎לוז‎, is for man what the ‎expression ‎היולי‎ is meant to convey when we speak of the origin ‎of the universe, the primordial raw material. Yaakov’s ‎contribution was to make out of a potential Jewish nation one ‎that had materialized.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 6_Paragraph": "Another interpretation of the line ‎וה' ברך את אברהם בכל‎, is ‎based on the fact that there are two types of <i>tzaddikim</i>. One ‎type concentrates all his efforts in life on being of service to the ‎community, whereas another type of <i>tzaddik</i> concentrates ‎on perfecting his personal character traits. Avraham was of the ‎former category, all his efforts being directed outward, for the ‎benefit of his peers. This is alluded to in the words ‎וה' ברך את ‏אברהם‎, i.e. G’d was with Avraham on account of his concern “for ‎all.” The word ‎את‎ in the line is to be understood as ‎עם‎, “with.” G’d ‎supported him in all his endeavours. It is this point that our sages ‎alluded to when they said that Avraham had a ‎בת‎, i.e. he had a ‎large measuring device that was big enough to share out from it ‎to all he came in contact with.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 19_Paragraph": "When the Torah writes at the beginning of chapter 15 that ‎היה דבר ה' אל אברם במחזה לאמור‎, “the word of Hashem came to ‎Avram in a ‘vision,’ proceeding to say, etc.;“ we understand ‎this as a manifestation of G’d’s word to Avram by a vision ‎screened by a veil while he was engaged in serving G’d by the ‎performance of mitzvot with various parts of his body.<br>‎At that point G’d told Avram not to be afraid, ‎אל תירא אברם‎, ‎as he would continue to act as his shield, ‎אנכי מגן לך‎. G’d ‎reassured Avram that the fact that he was now serving Him by ‎performing ‎מצות‎, i.e. under the auspices of the ‎יש‎ instead of the ‎auspices of the ‎אין‎, that this was not a lowering of the standards ‎that he was used to, but that on the contrary, he was in line for ‎a great reward, ‎שכרך הרבה מאד‎. <br>As long as the Torah had not yet been given, fulfilling the ‎‎“commandments” while in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was quite different ‎from nowadays when the Torah has been given, and fulfilling the ‎parts of it that are capable of being fulfilled in the Diaspora, is ‎deserving of recognition. When Avram served G’d outside the ‎land of Israel, concentrating on the aspect known as ‎מסירת נפש‎, ‎wholehearted physical and mental devotion to the Lord, he ‎thereby “repaired” the reputation of G’d amongst mankind, ‎which had sustained considerable damage due to the sins of ‎mankind which had apparently been ignored by the Creator, thus ‎giving the impression that He either did not care or was unable to ‎deal with.<br><i>Tanchuma</i> 8 on <i>Parshat Chukat</i>, relates in ‎the name of Rabbi Yossi bar Chaninah, that at the time when ‎Moses ascended to the celestial regions He found G’d preoccupied ‎with the details of the rules pertaining to the red heifer. He ‎overheard G’d saying that the correct ruling concerning the age ‎of the red heifer when it is to be burnt is according to “my son ‎Rabbi Eliezer,” i.e. when it is one year old. Anyone reading this ‎‎<i>Midrash</i> must surely ask how G’d had been able to say ‎something like that, seeing that Rabbi Eliezer was born more than ‎‎1000 years after Moses died. We have a tradition that man is not ‎programmed, can make his own decisions, so that it is impossible ‎to foretell who will say what tomorrow, never mind 1000 years ‎hence?<br>In answering this justified question, we must consider ‎that the domain we called ‎אין‎, the totally spiritual domains of the ‎universe, included within it all the aspects of wisdom as ‎something potential. While this potential had not yet assumed ‎definitive proportions until someone possessed of both body and ‎soul was able to formulate it, its very existence in “embryonic” ‎form, so to speak, makes it possible for a human being when the ‎time comes to draw upon this “wisdom” and make use of it in the ‎material world of the ‎יש‎. The example of the “red heifer” ‎discussed in the <i>Tanchuma</i> is merely an illustration of the ‎principle that nothing “new” or “original” is produced in the ‎realm of the physical world, the world known as the ‎יש‎ in ‎‎<i>kabbalistic</i> parlance, or “<i>olam hazeh</i>”, in what we are ‎used to refer to when speaking of what goes on the planet we live ‎on. The acquisition of such ‎חכמה‎, wisdom, as is necessary to arrive ‎at the conclusion that the red heifer must be two years old when ‎it is to be burnt, is largely a matter of the will of the individual ‎grappling with this <i>halachic</i> problem. <small>The “freedom of ‎choice,” as we call it, means that we are free to decide if we want ‎to make the effort to acquire such wisdom or not. It is not ‎withheld from anyone who truly labours to acquire it by willing it ‎with all his being. While he was in the celestial regions, Moses ‎heard that there would in due course be a scholar by the name of ‎Rabbi Eliezer who would have attained that particular piece of ‎wisdom enabling him to correctly rule on the problem that was ‎under discussion in the heavenly spheres at that time. ‎Ed.]</small><br>G’d has two options when dealing with man’s aspirations. ‎He can either decide to grant man’s request in accordance with that ‎person’s expressed wish, or He can decide to be guided by what ‎the overall situation in His universe requires for its good at the time, ‎‎[as frequently, if not most of the time, the desires of an individual ‎do not correspond to, or coincide with what is in the best interests ‎of the world as seen by its Creator.‎‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 16_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎14,18. <b>“and Malki Tzedek King of Shalem produced bread ‎and wine, seeing that he was a priest loyal to the Supreme ‎G’d.”</b> <br>We have previously referred to two different types of ‎people worshipping G’d, one worshipping Him out of a sense of ‎negating himself as a person, making no demands on life, whereas ‎the other expresses his worship of G’d through performance of ‎positive and negative commandments, as well as by being of ‎assistance to his fellow-man. The former is dedicated truly to the ‎metaphysical world, the totally spiritual Being Who created the ‎universe, the one we described as ‎אין‎, presiding over ‎אין‎ prior to ‎commencing creation, whereas the other serves the Lord under ‎the heading ‎יש‎, thereby raising the phenomena in the physical ‎world from a mundane to a more spiritual level when he performs ‎the positive and negative commandments of his Creator. G’d gave ‎the Jewish people these commandments to perform as part of ‎living in a domain called “‎יש‎.” Since the person serving G’d under ‎the heading of ‎אין‎ does not perform specific commandments ‎applicable in the ‎יש‎ part of the universe, he cannot draw down ‎from the metaphysical world any of G’d’s largesse, held in reserve ‎by G’d for the human race. <br>It is an error to think that by ‎performing ‎מצות מעשיות‎ commandments involving our bodies in ‎what appear to be mundane activities, we have closed the door to ‎being part of the meta-physical world, the ‎אין‎. This element of the ‎אין‎ part of the universes is the ‎נחת רוח‎, a pleasurable sensation, ‎satisfaction that man’s good deeds cause the Creator to ‎experience.<br>Indeed, he who draws down upon himself physical ‎gratifications in this world by means of his ‎מצוה‎ performance, ‎attaches himself both to the ‎אין‎ and to theיש  ‏‎ aspects of the ‎universes; he does the former through having desired to provide ‎his Creator with this sense of satisfaction, with the feeling that ‎He has demonstrated to the creatures in the celestial regions that ‎He had been correct in His fondest hopes when He undertook to ‎create a free-willed human being; such a person also attached ‎himself to the ‎יש‎ part of the universe as the commandments of ‎the Torah were given in order to make him an inseparable part of ‎this ‎יש‎ part of the universe. This is the reason why, on occasion, ‎we find that some people by dint of performing G’d’s ‎commandments find their livelihood on this earth.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 17_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 7,1 ‎<b>“For I have seen you ‎being righteous before Me in this generation;”</b> these words ‎must be understood according to the <i>Zohar</i> I, 67. The ‎author of the <i>Zohar</i> contrasts Moses’ reaction to G’d’s ‎threat to annihilate the Jewish people and to substitute him for ‎the Jewish people (Exodus 32,10) with Noach’s silence. Moses, had ‎immediately responded to this threat by saying: “erase me from ‎Your Book, rather than make me the founder of a new Jewish ‎people. Moses was willing to give up his life if he could thereby ‎save his people”. When G’d (7,4) used the same expression ‎ומחיתי ‏את כל היקום‎, “I will erase all breathing living creatures,” He ‎elicited no response from Noach, just as He had not elicited a ‎response from him in 6,13, or in 6,17. Moses, by offering his own ‎life on behalf of his people during the episode of the golden calf, ‎atoned for Noach’s insensitivity at this time. Moses is viewed by ‎the Zohar as possessing a soul composed of all the souls destroyed ‎in the deluge. This is why our prophets refer to the deluge as ‎מי ‏נח‎, “the waters of Noach,” since Noach had not intervened on ‎behalf of his contemporaries. (Isaiah 54,9). The prophet appears ‎to imply that Noach had been remiss by associating the deluge ‎with Noach (himself) instead of with the sinners.‎<br>It is known that Moses was considered a <i>tzaddik</i>, ‎righteous person. When our sages state that all the prophets’ ‎prophecies began with the word ‎כה‎, whereas Moses’ prophecy on ‎occasion commenced with the word ‎זה‎, “this,” they meant to ‎compare Moses to Noach of whom G’d had said ‎אותך ראיתי צדיק ‏לפני בדור הזה‎, “I have seen you that you are a <i>tzaddik</i> before ‎Me in this generation”. G’d implied that Noach would be restored ‎posthumously to this stature when Moses, a reincarnation of his ‎soul, would make up for his omission at this time. The words ‎בדור ‏הזה‎, are understood as a hint that in Moses’ time another ‎‎<i>tzaddik</i> would compensate for the sin of omission in Noach’s ‎generation. ‎",

The practical significance of this statement is that whereas prior ‎to this point earth had been the “recipient” of celestial input, from this point on it is the task of ‎earth and what occurs on its surface to “kick back” beneficial vibrations to the celestial regions, i.e. ‎the result of man fulfilling his duty on earth. The author bases himself on psalms 148,13 ‎הודו על ארץ ‏ושמים‎, which he translates as “His majesty is above earth and heaven,” earth being mentioned ‎first.

        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 31_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 25,17. Concerning <i>Rashi’s</i> comment based on Rabbi ‎Chiya that the reason that the lifetime of Yishmael was listed in ‎the Torah is to show that Yaakov spent 14 years hiding in the ‎academy founded by Shem and subsequently headed by his great-‎grandson Ever; surely it is strange that this piece of information ‎was of such significance that the Torah had to write about it, ‎albeit as an allusion! Why did the Torah not simply write that ‎Yaakov hid there instead of adding a paragraph of seven verses ‎detailing Yishmael’s descendants?!<br>The intention of the Torah ‎was to illustrate the influence of a <i>tzaddik</i> in elevating ‎people in his immediate proximity to a spiritually higher level. It ‎also demonstrates that when a <i>tzaddik</i> loses this ability to ‎elevate his environment spiritually he has to go into hiding ‎instead, as through his failure he arouses G’d’s wrath at the ‎wicked and his remaining in their environment would expose him ‎to the judgment G’d has in store for them. Isaiah 26,20 makes this ‎point when he writes: ‎חבי כמעט רגע וגו'‏‎, “hide for a brief moment ‎and lock the doors behind you!” (Compare the <i>Zohar’s</i> I ‎‎182, comment on this verse) This was also the reason why Elijah ‎hid during the years of famine that he had decreed (Kings I 17,2) ‎so that the ravens had to bring him food. At that time it was ‎beyond Elijah’s powers to spiritually elevate the people of his ‎generation. Eventually, as described in the same Book, Elijah was ‎commanded by G’d to come out of hiding, as by that time the ‎ground had been prepared for his message to resonate among ‎some of the people. His success is recorded in King’s I 18,39, ‎although, alas it was short-lived. It is a fact that for a while at ‎least, Yaakov’s encounter with Esau resulted in a spiritual ‎elevation of his brother Esau, who even wanted to share the world ‎with him. The reason why Yaakov succeeded partially with Esau ‎though failing with Yishmael, was that Esau was his twin brother, ‎as opposed to Yishmael who was only his uncle. <small>[Esau voluntarily ‎vacated the land of Israel (Canaan) in order not to compete with ‎his brother. (Genesis 36,6-8) Ed.]</small> When the Torah lists the years ‎Yishmael lived, it was to inform us that he lived that many years ‎only on account of his nephew Yaakov’s merit. If Yaakov had ‎been able to bring about a spiritual reawakening of his uncle, he ‎would not have had to hide.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 26_Paragraph": "<small>[There follows a paragraph that I have not been able to follow ‎completely, so that I am not able to translate into English ‎without possibly misrepresenting the author’s meaning. ‎Ed.]</small><br>An alternate approach to the verse: “Yitzchok went for ‎a stroll in the field close to evening, when he raised his eyes ‎and beheld camels approaching” The Talmud (<i>B’rachot</i> ‎‎26), when commenting on this line says that Avraham, (compare ‎Genesis 19,26) composed the daily morning prayer, the word ‎ויעמוד‎ “he stood,” meaning that he stood engaged in prayer, ‎whereas Yitzchok composed the daily afternoon prayer, ‎מנחה‎. ‎According to the Talmud, the word ‎שיחה‎ when used in the Torah ‎always refers to prayer, ‎תפלה‎. <small>[It does not occur again in the ‎Torah, although it does occur in psalms 102,1.Ed.]</small> Yaakov, the ‎third of the patriarchs, introduced the evening prayer, ‎מעריב‎. ‎This is based on Genesis 28,11 ‎ויפגע במקום וילן שם כי בא השמש‎, “he ‎met G’d there as the sun was about to set and spent the night ‎there.” <small>[The word ‎המקום‎, meaning G’d, is not unusual. Ed.]</small> We ‎need to examine why a prayer is called ‎מנחה‎, “gift.” The morning ‎prayer being called ‎שחרית‎, is easy to understand as the word ‎שחר‎ ‎means morning, when the sun begins to shine. Calling the ‎evening prayer ‎מעריב‎ is also easy to understand as it is offered in ‎the evening, ‎ערב‎. But naming the afternoon prayer ‎מנחה‎ appears ‎somewhat difficult. <i>Tossaphot Yom Tov</i>, already recognized ‎this anomaly and answers it by referring to the period when it is ‎recited as ‎מנוחת השמש‎, “when the sun rests.”<br>I propose a different explanation. I believe the root of the ‎word ‎מנחה‎ is simply “gift,” not “rest.” This prayer is presented at ‎a time, when man does not think that he has to either thank the ‎Lord for having awoken well from his sleep, or after having ‎completed the day’s chores without problems and entrusting our ‎soul to G’d once more when we lie down, confident that He will ‎restore it to us in the morning. Neither of these considerations ‎motivates us to devote time to prayer in the middle of our daily ‎activities. If we take time out to pray during the day nonetheless, ‎G’d may consider this as a gift from us to Him.‎",

In fact Adam lived for close to 1000 years! (Genesis 5,5). Our sages ‎have already had difficulty in reconciling these two verses.<br>‎In order to understand the whole episode, we must first of all understand what wiles the serpent ‎used in order to seduce the woman. How could the serpent, a mere creature, persuade a human ‎being to defy the law of its Creator? We must understand the serpent’s argument as follows: the ‎serpent made it clear that it was aware that everything in this universe was created by G’d through ‎a directive issued by word of mouth as when He said: “let there be light.” The continued existence ‎of the universe is dependent every second since it began, and continues to depend on this original ‎light created by G’d through His first directive. It follows that the tree of knowledge which also ‎came into being by Divine command could not possibly be a source of harm and even death, seeing ‎it too had been created subsequent to the original life-giving force in the universe, the light ‎created on the first day. The serpent therefore argued that it follows that when G’d issued ‎instructions not to eat from the trees in the garden, the reason for this command could not have ‎been that it was a source of death for anyone eating from its fruit. Since this was so, why should ‎man listen to a latter command, instead of to His initial command, as a result of which they had ‎become living human beings!‎<br>This, however, was part of the perverted logic employed by the serpent. The truth of the matter is ‎that the “root” of the tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden goes back to a period preceding ‎creation of the physical universe and the “falling off” of 288 “sparks” from the <i>Shechinah ‎‎</i>into the world of the ‎קליפות‎, regions polluted by impurity, i.e. our physical universe. ‎",

They will benefit spiritually merely ‎by looking at their Rabbi. Avraham at the time had realized that ‎the three strangers who had appeared in front of him suddenly ‎were superior beings as his own powers of perception had been ‎sharpened by their arrival and his facing them. It was this ‎realization that his perceptive powers had been enhanced, that ‎prompted him at the time not only to walk toward these visitors ‎but to run in order to make them welcome.‎<br>The repetition by the Torah of the words ‎ראו ראינו‎ is to draw ‎our attention to both Avimelech and his entourage having ‎experienced these enhanced powers of perception. They had ‎become aware that their powers of “seeing” had not only been ‎improved quantitatively but also qualitatively, i.e. they had ‎experienced the awe of feeling in the presence of a spiritually ‎superior being.

When the roles ‎of the male and the female appear to be reversed, i.e. the female ‎appearing to initiate and the male appearing to respond, the ‎usual relationship is totally askew. The latter situation was the ‎case here, and this is expressed by the Torah writing the word ‎לנוכח אשתו‎, an expression indicating ‎היפוך‎, a totally reversed ‎situation.

I ‎might have thought that when concluding the benediction they ‎would also mention the names of all the patriarchs; in order to ‎signal that this is not so, the Torah continues with ‎והיה ברכה‎, “be ‎a blessing!” (sing) i.e. that the signature of the benediction ‎contains only the name of Avraham, i.e. ‎מגן אברהם‎, “(Gd) the ‎shield of Avraham.”‎<br>There are three attributes that G’d employs in His continuous ‎relations with the creatures in His universe; they are ‎אהבה‎, “love,” ‎גבורה‎, “power,” and ‎תפארת‎, “harmony, splendour.” When G’d ‎relates to His creatures with the attribute of ‎אהבה‎, “love,” all ‎parts of the universe are filled with all manner of “good” ‎‎(welcome) phenomena. When He has recourse to the attribute of ‎גבורה‎, “power,” the result is that the creatures affected will feel ‎the opposite of comfortable. When G’d employs the attribute of ‎תפארת‎ in relation to His creatures, the world will also feel an ‎abundance of goodness, as it is G’d’s purpose and desire to be able ‎to glorify in His choicest creation, man. When G’d is able to do ‎this, He inundates the universe with love. We must not ‎misunderstand the attribute of ‎גבורה‎ by regarding it as something ‎negative. While the attribute of ‎גבורה‎, when active, may appear to ‎the people affected by it as something negative, unwelcome in ‎the extreme, it is designed to enable G’d to again relate to all His ‎creatures with love, once that attribute has accomplished its ‎purpose.‎<br>This is what we are told in Job 8,7 (by Bildad) ‎והיה ראשיתך מצער ‏ואחריתך ישגה מאד‎, “though your beginning may be small (painful), ‎in the end you will grow very great.” The overriding function of ‎the attribute of ‎גבורה‎ is to carry out retribution in the world so ‎that G’d will afterwards be able to pour out all His goodness on ‎His creatures. Historically, the person who had realized this better ‎than anyone else, was Nachum, nick-named, ‎איש גם זו‎, who ‎whenever something happened to him that was unpleasant, ‎painful, etc., immediately reacted by saying: ‎גם זו לטובה‎, “this too ‎will eventually be revealed as having been a positive, constructive ‎event.” (<i>Taanit</i> 21).‎‎).<br>It is generally known that Avraham symbolizes the attribute ‎of love, whereas Yitzchok symbolizes the attribute of power, and ‎Yaakov symbolizes a merging of these two attributes, resulting in ‎what we call ‎תפארת‎, harmony. When the Talmud in ‎‎<i>Pessachim</i> 117 first thought that it would be appropriate to ‎sign the first benediction of the <i>amidah</i> prayer by referring ‎to G’d as the G’d of Avraham, Yitzchok, and Yaakov, it concluded ‎that the reason the sages who formulated this prayer did not do ‎so, was because they wanted to stress that ultimately, what G’d ‎is all about is the attribute of love, the attribute personified best ‎in the personality of Avraham. <small>[The <i>Maharshah</i> on that ‎section of the Talmud points out that the letters in the word ‎והיה‎ ‎are the same as the letters in the tetragram, i.e. the name of G’d ‎symbolizing the attribute of Mercy. Ed.]</small> The other two attributes’ ‎function is auxiliary, i.e. to help G’d be able to fully display His ‎attribute of love.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 2_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎24,1. <b>“and Avraham had become old, while G’d had ‎blessed him in everything.”</b> According to the Talmud <i>Baba ‎Metzia</i> 87 the concept of ”old age,” was unknown to mankind ‎until Avraham’s being described here in such terms. <small>[According ‎to the Talmud, the statement refers to external features of elderly ‎people stamping them as having lived for many years. This was ‎why up until then anyone looking at Avraham or Yitzchok could ‎not be sure whether he was looking at the father or the son. ‎Ed.]</small><br><small>[If I understand the Talmud correctly, what is meant is ‎that when the Torah had described Adam as having begotten a ‎son in his own image (Genesis 5,3) as opposed to his first two ‎sons, the resemblance between fathers and sons continued ‎unabated until the time when Avraham was described as having ‎aged. Ed.]</small><br>The point the Talmud makes is that beneficial ‎largesse provided from the celestial regions for the lower regions ‎of the universe manifests itself in one of two ways. It may be ‎measured in terms familiar to us in this part of the universe, or it ‎may be described in terms of concepts applicable in the celestial ‎regions, seeing that these two domains each have their own set of ‎rules. When this beneficial largesse originates directly in the ‎celestial spheres close to the Creator, it had not become subject to ‎limitations applicable in the parts of the world we live in. <small>[As an ‎example, we may distinguish between nourishment provided by ‎G’d through the earth giving its yield, when such nourishment is ‎subject to limitations that apply on our planet, whereas when G’d ‎fed the Jewish people with manna, such limitations did not apply, ‎as the manna originated directly in one of the seven layers of ‎heaven. Ed.]</small> This latter method of benefiting from G’d’s largesse is ‎reserved exclusively for the Jewish people. The Jewish people ‎have become privy to this (on occasion) due to their having clung ‎to their Creator with such devotion.‎<br>The other nations sharing this planet with us, receive ‎whatever largesse G’d provides for them only through “nature,” ‎which “processes” such gifts from G’d before it reaches its ‎recipients. This is what is meant when the Torah wrote in Genesis ‎‎25,12-15 ‎ואלה תולדות ישמעאל שנים עשר נשיאים לאומתם‎, “and this is ‎the line of Ishmael, son of Avraham……12 chieftains, etc.” The ‎word: ‎לאומתם‎ is derived from ‎אמה‎, “mother;” when a mother ‎measures her son she uses measuring devices used in our parts of ‎the universe. The Torah (Genesis 25,13, and again in verse 16) ‎adds: ‎בשמותם לתולדותם‎ and ‎בחצריהם ובטירותם‎, “by their names, in ‎the order of their births, and by their villages and their ‎encampments;” these words describe the parameters within ‎which they were privy to G’d’s benevolent largesse. The contrast ‎with which the Torah describes a similar description of the ‎development of the Jewish people can be seen in the words ‎למשפחותם לבית אבותם‎, “according to their family, their respective ‎father’s house”. The word ‎אבותם‎ in this instance is derived from ‎אבה‎, as in ‎לא אבה יבמי‎, “he did not want to perform levirate ‎marriage with me.” (Deuteronomy 25.7) The word ‎אבה‎ is a ‎synonym for ‎רצון‎, “will, desire.” The widow describes that her ‎brother-in-law does not wish to fulfill the will of heaven in ‎maintaining his deceased brother’s name alive.<br>Let us ‎illustrate by an example more familiar to all of us. A potter ‎intends to create a vase of a certain shape and colour. Before ‎setting out to shape the clay he has a definite image of the ‎finished product in his mind’s eye. This image is known as ‎מחשבה‎, ‎or ‎אב הפעולה‎, “the father of the finished product.” The ‎רצון‎, the ‎will to create a vase, is called ‎אב‎, father, as it precedes even the ‎sculptor’s vision of the final shape and colour of the product is ‎about to embark on creating. The eventual product is known as ‎בני בנים‎, euphemism for “grandchildren.” <small>[In relation to the ‎רצון‎ ‎the initial will to create something. Ed.]</small><br>Israel’s drawing down ‎G’d’s largesse to itself is somewhat similar. The process begins ‎with this celestial largesse entering the domain of the physical ‎universe, ‎גבולין‎. <small>[A domain defined by borders both dimensionally ‎and directionally. Ed.]</small> The various shapes and forms this largesse ‎assumes once it has entered our part of the universe is known as ‎בני בנים‎, “grandchildren.” The original ‎רצון‎, G’d’s intention to ‎provide this largesse, is called ‎זקן‎, “an old man.”<br>When ‎Solomon in Proverbs 17,6 speaks about ‎עטרת זקנים בני בנים‎, loosely ‎translated as “grandchildren are the crown of their elders,” the ‎meaning of this line on a deeper level, is: “the largesse that has ‎been received by Israelites as a result of G’d’s benevolence, is ‎rooted in the will of G’d,” i.e. from this ‎רצון‎ to the world known as ‎בני בנים‎. ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 20_Paragraph": "Our author proceeds to tackle the problem from another ‎angle. In order to get to the root of the matter we must ‎remember that the word ‎פקד‎ and the word ‎זכר‎, both loosely ‎translated as “to remember,” are not interchangeable. The ‎‎<i>Zohar</i> explains that the word ‎פקד‎ is used in connection with ‎the feminine parts of the emanations, whereas the word ‎זכר‎ ‎belongs to the masculine side of these emanations. It follows that ‎the word ‎פקידה‎, implies that the party remembered had ‎previously “received” something <small>[as the feminine is always ‎perceived in terms of being a receptacle. Ed.]</small> The “root,” i.e. ‎origin of all promises received is G’d. When G’d gives a promise to ‎Israel we rely on this promise absolutely. We have no doubt that ‎He will shower His largesse upon us at the appropriate time. It is ‎also clear that when G’d promises to do something for us, that ‎this “something” is still securely under His control. At the same ‎time, we need to remember that due to G’d being eternal, i.e. ‎timeless, He does not think in terms of “past” and “future.” ‎Concepts such as “past” and “future” are relevant only to the ‎potential recipients of the promises made by G’d. For the ‎recipients of the promise, it remains in the realm of the potential ‎rather than actual. For them, the time when such a promise will ‎be fulfilled is something concealed, i.e. it exists only in the ‎‎“future.” The period that elapses between the promise being ‎made and its fulfillment is what we call ‎אמונה‎, “faith.” Since a ‎‎<i>tzaddik</i> never doubts that the promise will be fulfilled, the ‎period during which he expects fulfillment bonds him to his ‎Creator on an ongoing basis. G’d considers this period as one in ‎which the <i>tzaddik</i> displays his faith.‎",

The reason ‎that the Lord desires for Israel to serve Him and the resulting ‎satisfaction is known as ‎דלת‎, a word derived from ‎דלה ועניה‎, ‎poverty, inadequacy. Just as a poor man constantly feels in need, ‎so G’d constantly feels the desire to be served by His creatures. By ‎doing so, they provide Him with what in our parlance is “a ‎livelihood.” <small>[I have paraphrased this. Ed.]</small>‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 40_Paragraph": "Let us now proceed to explain the first verse in our portion, ‎לך לך מארצך...אל הארץ אשר אראך‎, a verse which presented ‎many commentators with difficulties. The major difficulty ‎bothering these commentators is that we do not find anywhere ‎that G’d showed Avram the land of which He had spoken. ‎Another difficulty they raise is at the end of the previous portion ‎when we read about Terach taking his family, including Avram ‎and his wife (Genesis 11,31) planning to settle in the land of ‎Canaan, but remaining in Charan without concluding his ‎intention. Terach may have had reasons of his own why he did ‎not continue his journey, but why did Avram and his wife not ‎continue, as planned?<br>The author relates an answer to this ‎query that he had heard from his father of sainted memory and ‎Rabbi Dov Baer of Mezeritch, based on a <i>Zohar I</i> 85 which ‎discusses the mystery of the unity of G’d which comprised ‎masculine and feminine attributes. When or how did these ‎‎“split?” <small>[The souls that descend into this world are perceived as ‎the “fruit” i.e. results of the deeds of the Creator, Ed.]</small> In our ‎domain of the universe we do not encounter such a fusion of ‎both attributes. <small>[If I understand correctly Rabbi Dov Baer drew a ‎parallel to the Talmud <i>Zevachim</i> 51 where the problem of ‎how blood of a burnt offering that was slaughtered on the ‎northern part of the altar, and transferred to bowls there, could ‎be poured down the south east corner, without violating the rule ‎that it must be poured down the ‎יסוד‎, base of the altar, (Exodus ‎‎29,12, et al) when the south east corner of the altar did not have ‎such a base, <small>[and the priests always had to walk in a certain ‎direction always turning right, not backtracking. Ed.]</small> <br>‎The gist of the Rabbi’s commentary is that there are two ways ‎in which to serve the Lord. One is based on awe of the Creator, ‎יראה‎, the other on love for Him, ‎אהבה‎. <small>[The matter has been ‎touched on already in connection with Genesis 14,15, page 56. ‎Ed.]</small><br>‎In order to serve G’d out of feelings of true awe one must ‎first have mastered Torah and its various disciplines and have ‎toiled greatly through study and concentration, performance of ‎the commandments, and good deeds; only then will one be ‎qualified to be granted the ability to serve the Lord by embracing ‎the attribute of awe, involving, as we explained previously, a total ‎negation of the self in doing so. ‎<br>‎On the other hand, it is ‎impossible to truly love one’s Creator except through one’s ‎‎(good) deeds. Love, i.e. selfless love, is based on recognizing this ‎attribute in G’d, Who has nothing to gain by performing loving ‎deeds for man who is unable to reciprocate, as He is not in need of ‎anything His creatures can offer Him. If someone employs his G’d ‎given intellect to search and find the goodness of G’d, he will be ‎rewarded by receiving further enlightenment from G’d. ‎<br>‎We ‎read in the <i>Zohar</i> that Avram realized that in the Holy Land ‎one could perform service of G’d properly; so that he “wrapped,” ‎i.e. committed himself wholly and enthusiastically to G’d. As a ‎result, whereas Terach had moved to Charan after Avram had ‎been saved from Nimrod’s furnace, only in order to save himself ‎from his former customers who accused him of having sold them ‎useless idols, he stayed there. Avram immediately experienced a ‎call from G’d, Who wished to help him fulfill his wish to go to the ‎Holy Land. By telling him that only he was to do so, G’d showed ‎him that if one honestly and sincerely wishes to serve His Creator, ‎the Creator, in turn will extend a helping hand. Since at that time ‎Avram’s awe was the principal element that prompted him, ‎seeing that he had experienced such a miraculous escape from ‎Nimrod’s furnace, he remained on this level of serving G’d from ‎יראה‎, a feeling of reverence and awe, for the time being. <br>When ‎G’d spoke about “showing” him the land to which he should ‎proceed, He meant that unless he would be given further ‎guidance by <i>Hashem</i>, he would not ascend higher rungs on ‎the ladder that would bring him closer to his Creator. G’d ‎mentioned three separate stages involved in his reaching his self-‎imposed objective. He had to shed certain concepts that had ‎previously attached him to the community surrounding him. ‎They are: ‎ארצך‎, ‎מולדך‎, ‎בית אביך‎, “your native land, your birthplace ‎within that land, your family, i.e. the house of your father.” The ‎three places mentioned represent ‎נפש, רוח, נשמה‎, 1) “physical ‎life-force, known as the body’s essence; 2) the “spirit”, seat of ‎one’s urges and physical aspirations; 3) the spiritual essence, ‎the soul.‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 30_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 22,1. <b>“It was after these events that G’d subjected ‎Avraham to a trial, saying to him: ‘Avraham!’”</b> We must try ‎and understand why at this point G’d addressed Avraham by ‎calling out: ”Avraham,” once, whereas in verse 11 of this chapter ‎the angel addressing Avraham calls out to him: “Avraham, ‎Avraham!” Another nuance that deserves our attention is why, ‎on the first occasion (verse 12) G’d compliments Avraham on not ‎having tried to withhold his beloved son from Him, ‎ולא חשכת את ‏בנך את יחידך ממני‎, whereas in verse 16 when the compliment is ‎repeated, the word ‎ממני‎, “from Me,” is absent. <br>This may be ‎understood when we consider that according to <i>Rashi</i> on ‎verse 11 repetition of the name indicates that the party addressed ‎by G’d is especially beloved by G’d. We find in Samuel I 3,10 that ‎when G’d called on Samuel, He always repeated his name when ‎addressing him. In the case of Avraham, his very name reflects ‎the fact that he was beloved by G’d. Here when G’d called upon ‎him seeing that He wanted him to perform a commandment, He ‎deliberately refrained for indicating how fond he was of him, as ‎this call had not been designed to make him go through with ‎slaughtering Yitzchok. However in verse16, when we became ‎aware that Avraham was not to slaughter his son, this had ‎become the ‎מצוה‎. By commanding Avraham not to harm ‎Yitzchok in any way, He displayed His true love for him. He did so ‎by repeating his name when He called him. <br>As to the word ‎ממני‎ in verse 12, this was the angel speaking (although in the ‎name of the Lord) <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 56,5 understands the ‎angel as hinting to Avraham that seeing the angels in heaven ‎have shed tears when they heard that Avraham had been asked to ‎sacrifice his son Yitzchok, G’d cancelled the decree. The angel ‎wanted Avraham to know that he had had a share in Yitzchok’s ‎surviving the <i>akeydah</i>. In verse 16, when G’d is speaking to ‎Avraham without intermediary, there was no reason to add the ‎word: ‎ממני‎, “from Me.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 9_Paragraph": "Our author, instead of using the phylacteries, which are not always worn, as a symbol of our duty ‎never to forget our purpose on earth, uses the words of our verse describing the utter chaos that ‎prevailed prior to G’d having embarked on His gigantic project of creating a universe inhabited by ‎man equipped with a free will, as such a reminder.‎<br>Our author sees in the word ‎והארץ‎ in our verse a veiled hint at the various temptations that human ‎beings are constantly exposed to by living in a physical world, temptations that are apt to interfere ‎with his desire to serve G’d as a loyal servant.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 5_Paragraph": "<b>‎“And Avraham had aged, advanced in years;\"</b> the Talmud ‎‎<i>Baba batra</i> 16 understands the word ‎בכל‎ as meaning that ‎Avraham had a “daughter” by the name of ‎בכל‎. Commenting ‎further on this, the Talmud in <i>Chagigah</i> 15 states that a ‎heavenly voice i.e. ‎בת קול‎ <small>[instead of ‎בת כל‎ Ed.]</small> was heard at ‎Mount Sinai calling the Israelites to penance with the exception ‎of Acher, (Elisha ben Avuya) turned apostate. <br>‎<small>[The text in my edition of the Talmud does not mention the ‎location where this heavenly voice was heard, and it would not ‎make sense that it was Mount Sinai, as the occasion appears to ‎have been at least 50 years after destruction of the second ‎Temple. Ed.]</small><br>We need to examine the nature of this “voice” somewhat ‎more closely. Since, according to the Talmud, this ‎בת קול‎ appears ‎to have been a visual manifestation rather than something heard ‎with one’s ears, the statement is enigmatic. Apparently, the ‎Talmud refers to a message that a person hears or is supposed to ‎hear daily as if it were as real as a vision. The true call to do ‎‎<i>teshuvah</i> had originated at Sinai when the people had heard ‎G’d address them directly during the first and second ‎Commandment, until they were so overwhelmed that they feared ‎to die and begged Moses to be their interpreter of G’d’s words. ‎Mount Sinai had been referred to as Mount Chorev in Exodus 3,1 ‎when Moses had his first vision of G’d at the burning bush. On ‎that occasion he had “heard” the voice of G’d. The term ‎בת קול‎ ‎has become the name for a derivative of that first communication ‎to His people through Moses their leader and prophet ever since. ‎At the revelation at Mount Sinai several months later, it had ‎become so real that the people were described as “seeing” the ‎voice rather than as merely “hearing it. (Exodus 20,15) We have ‎explained that the term ‎בן‎ or ‎בת‎ describes the receiving of G’d’s ‎largesse, when it has originated from G’d directly through the ‎merits of the patriarch Avraham. Just as G’d had to “reduce ‎Himself” in terms of His pure spirituality, man has to reduce his ‎‎“physicality,” i.e. his dependence on physical comforts provided ‎by our world somewhat, in order to qualify for receiving these ‎communications from G’d. Each human being desirous of coming ‎closer to G’d by this means has to do so in accordance with the ‎spiritual level he is capable of. The word ‎בת‎ in the language of the ‎‎<i>Mishnah</i>, is the preface used when describing the measure ‎of certain liquids or dry matter that a container can hold. Its use ‎in that sense originates in Ezekiel 45,10. <small>[It may be correct to ‎understand the term ‎בת קול‎ which is usually associated with post ‎Biblical times, when there was no more direct communication ‎with G’d through prophets or even through the <i>urim ‎vetumim</i> on the High Priest’s breast plate, as a prophetic ‎communication from G’d, but at arm’s length. Ed.]‎‎‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 9_Paragraph": "While on the subject of the meal Avraham prepared for these ‎heavenly guests, we need to understand why he served them ‎meat instead of fish. The motivation may have been to afford his ‎guests to perform many commandments in short order; in the ‎terrestrial regions, nowadays, before being able to consume a ‎meat meal many more commandments must be fulfilled than ‎before preparing a fish meal. This is in contrast with the world to ‎come, where, according to our tradition, G’d will present the ‎righteous with a meal consisting of the Leviathan. There are ‎many more commandments associated with the preparation of a ‎meaty meal than with the preparation of a “fish meal,” i.e. ‎Leviathan. (Baba Metzia 86) According to the Talmud, Avraham ‎slaughtered three calves in order to be able to offer each of his ‎guests a tongue and mustard (as seasoning), considered the ‎choicest meat of the animal.‎<br>The Talmud <i>Eyruvin</i> 53 relates that when Rabbi Yossi ‎bar Avion wished to say something that only people familiar with ‎him would understand, he would say: ”‎עשו לי שור במשפט בטור ‏מסכן‎;“ he deliberately used some Hebrew words, ‎שור‎, ‎במשפט‎, ‎which have a different meaning in Aramaic. Similarly, the word ‎חרדל‎ used by our sages for the seasoning Avraham provided for ‎his guests is really a translation of the words ‎הר דל‎, “a low hill.” In ‎short, the Rabbi making excuses for the errors committed by the ‎Jewish people, referred to the evil urge as an almost ‎insurmountable obstacle, a tall mountain, whereas the urge to do ‎good given to every human being, appeared like a low hill, so that ‎it is not surprising that many Jews many times found it difficult ‎to climb over the tall mountain in order to avoid sinning. When ‎the sages spoke of the “seasoning” Avraham served his guests, ‎this is merely a euphemism for saying that he tried to provide his ‎guests with merits by the type of food served that would make it ‎relatively easy to overcome the temptations offered by the evil ‎urge. When the angels would reflect on this, they in turn, in the ‎future, would tone down their accusations against sinful Jews, ‎having realized through their visit on earth how difficult it is to ‎fight these temptations.", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 8_Paragraph": "The words: ‎לפני ‏האלוקים‎, would have to be translated as “formerly the attribute of ‎Justice.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 4_Paragraph": "Another word that at first glance appears as unnecessary, is the word ‎את‎, which becomes clearer ‎when we understand it as equivalent to the word ‎אתה‎, as in ‎בא‎, meaning “it came, or He came,” as ‎in Deut.33,2 ‎ה' מסיני בא וזרח משעיר למו הופיע מהר פארן ואתה מרבבות קודש‎, “the Lord came from ‎Sinai, He shone upon them from Seir, He appeared from Paran having come from <i>Ribeboth</i> ‎‎<i>Kodesh</i>.” The word alludes to the fact that the original light of which the Torah said ‎ויהי אור‎ ‎instead of ‎ויהי כן‎, “and so it was,” -the Torah’s standard phrase for nature having complied with any ‎of G’d’s directives,- had been in existence prior to heaven and earth being created, but while prior ‎to that it had existed only in a disembodied celestial world, it had extended its function to light up ‎the newly created physical universe. This light that had previously only served the ‎אין סוף‎, the ‎Creator, directly, now served His creatures also. It did so to the extent that G’d’s creatures could ‎benefit by it and not be blinded by it. When we understand that word in this manner, we can also ‎understand why, at the end of the Torah’s report of the creation (Genesis 2,3) ‎אשר ברא אלוקים ‏לעשות‎, “which G’d had created to do;” the Torah writes the otherwise superfluous word ‎לעשות‎. ‎The Torah thereby also indicates that G’d renews the creative process on a daily basis, both in its ‎spiritual as well as in its profane aspects. On the preceding six “days,” G’d had created worlds that ‎served as the prologue to the physical world.", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 8_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎24,13-15. <b>“Here I am standing at the well…and the ‎daughters of the residents of the town are coming out… and ‎through her I will know that You have performed a loving ‎kindness for my master.” “and behold Rivkah who had been ‎born for Bethuel son of Milkah, was coming out, ‎etc.”</b><br>When looking at the precision with which the Torah ‎describes every detail surrounding this encounter, we must ask ‎ourselves what need there was for Eliezer to refer to the other ‎daughters of Aram Naharayim at all? What part did they play in ‎the story? Furthermore, why did the Torah write the word ‎ילדה‎ ‎with a dot in the letter ‎ל‎, suggesting that the birth of Rivkah was ‎connected to a cause other than Bethuel merely impregnating his ‎wife with his semen? The vowel <i>kubutz</i> under the letter ‎י‎, ‎instead of the vowel <i>kametz</i>, also adds to the impression ‎that there were external factors involved in Rivkah’s birth. <small>[The ‎reader will note that when Rivkah identified herself to Eliezer in ‎verse 24, she only used the word ‎ילדה‎ in an active mode with the ‎vowel <i>kametz</i>, when she referred to her grandmother ‎Milkah having born her father for Nachor. Ed.]</small><br>According to ‎the approach that we have followed in explaining these verses in ‎terms of G’d’s largesse and how it is transmitted to our part of the ‎universe to the righteous, none of these nuances are difficult. We ‎have explained that Avraham’s spiritual level in this world was ‎one that enabled him to elevate mankind by stages to higher ‎spiritual levels, i.e. bringing them closer to their Creator. He did ‎this by opening channels of G’d’s largesse to flow directly, ‎without detours, to the society within which he was active. ‎Eliezer, Avraham’s servant was well aware that the local ‎population of Aram Naharayim consisted of wicked people. In ‎order to examine whether the young lady who was to become ‎Yitzchok’s wife belonged to the wicked part of this population, he ‎had to devise a special scheme. If he were to find among the ‎virgins that came forth from the town to draw water one who ‎distinguished herself by the characteristic of loving kindness, i.e. ‎the same characteristic that distinguished his master Avraham, ‎he felt certain that such a girl must have had her roots in ‎Avraham’s family. She must have been blessed with such an ‎attribute through the activities of Avraham on this earth. When ‎he described himself as “standing at the well,” he positioned ‎himself in such a manner that he had a chance to test the girls ‎concerning their characteristics such as offering help beyond the ‎absolute minimum to an unknown stranger such as himself. Such ‎a girl, by definition, was destined to continue to be active ‎practicing the virtues for which Avraham his master was famous.‎<br>The words: ‎והנה רבקה יוצאת אשר ילדה לבתואל‎, are to alert ‎us that from the generous attitude displayed by Rivkah it became ‎manifest that a contributing factor to her birth had been the ‎benevolent influence Avraham had exerted on the people of his ‎time, and especially on members of his family. A girl who would ‎voluntarily exert herself on behalf of a stranger’s camels would ‎demonstrate the attribute of ‎חסד‎, loving concern for others, that ‎characterized Avraham and his deceased wife, Sarah.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 2_Paragraph": "The author suggest as a more likely explanation of the words ‎אלה תולדות יצחק בן אברהם, אברהם הוליד את יצחק‎, that the Torah ‎testifies to Yitzchok’s distinctive characteristic being ‎יראה‎, awe ‎and reverence of Gd, i.e. that as a founding father of the Jewish ‎nation, Yitzchok’s characteristic contributed the awe of the ‎majesty of G’d that is common to most Jews. This attribute ‎enables the average Jew to keep his distance from everything evil ‎or wicked, i.e. ‎סור מרע‎. This attribute is an offshoot of the ‎attribute of <i>tzimtzum</i>, voluntary limitations, that G’d ‎imposed upon Himself prior to creating the physical universe. ‎Having realized that this was one of G’d’s attributes, Yitzchok ‎emulated this. There is another way of achieving similar results, ‎i.e. Avraham’s way of negating the allures of this world almost ‎completely and thereby coming ever closer to G’d resulting in ‎love for Him, as we have described repeatedly. The opening line of ‎our <i>Parshah</i> therefore mentions that both father and son, ‎each in their own way, practiced virtues that guaranteed that he ‎would come closer to G’d all the time.‎",

The three armed ‎ש‎ symbolizes ‎the twelve tribes, seeing that the head of each of these “arms,” ‎comprises four components, making a total of 12, each tribe ‎being “rooted” in one of these “roots. <small>[For a comprehensive ‎treatment of the symbolisms in the letter ‎ש‎, the reader is referred ‎to Rabbi Michael Munk’s “wisdom in the Hebrew Alphabet,” ‎pages 207-213. Ed.]</small> These 12 ‎שרשים‎, roots, are also known as 12 ‎dazzlingly white lights known as ‎אין‎ and ‎יש‎ respectively. There is ‎another ‎שורש‎, root, above the twelve mentioned which is known ‎as ‎אפס‎, “void.” Concerning this latter root we are told in the ‎‎<i>Sefer yetzirah</i> (ancient kabbalistic text attributed to ‎Avraham) ‎בלום פיך מלדבר ולבך מלהרר‎, “restrain your mouth from ‎speaking and your heart from even contemplating.” (The subject ‎is the ten emanations by means of which G’d created the physical ‎universe in stages.)<br>Let us try and explain the subject by ‎means of a parable. A tree has numerous branches; each of these ‎‎“branches” is perceived as being “rooted” in the tree’s trunk. The ‎trunk itself possesses one root that includes all the other roots of ‎its branches. The word ‎אחד‎ “one,” alludes to this as the letters ‎ח‎+‎ד‎=12, whereas the letter ‎א‎ =1. The <i>Zohar II</i>,162, ‎commenting on B’rachot 17, that when saying the word ‎אחד‎ in ‎the <i>kriyat sch’ma</i>, one must not draw out the letter ‎א‎ as it ‎refers to this “void,” refers to the line from the <i>Sefer Yetzira</i> ‎that even spending time on trying to understand the true ‎meaning of G’d’s uniqueness is forbidden <small>[as it may lead one ‎astray. Ed.] </small>‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 22_Paragraph": "A different approach to understanding the verse ‎וה' פקד את ‏שרה כאשר אמר, ויעש ה' לשרה כאשר דבר‎, “G’d remembered ‎Sarah as He had said, and He did for her as he had stated.” ‎Why is it necessary for the Torah to state twice that G’d kept His ‎promise? Who had doubted it? The Talmud <i>Taanit</i> 20 states ‎that when G’d goes out of His way to perform a miracle for an ‎individual, this is used to deduct from the merits that individual ‎had accumulated up to that point. If G’d had performed a miracle ‎for Sarah and made her become pregnant and bear a son, this ‎would have been held against her accumulated merits. In order to ‎avoid this, G’d announced to Sarah and Avraham beforehand that ‎they would have a son, etc., so that when the time came for Sarah ‎to give birth, this was first and foremost not a miracle, but G’d ‎was simply fulfilling a duty, a promise He had made previously. ‎This is why the story of Yitzchok’s birth is prefaced by the verse ‎above in which the Torah reminds us of the promises G’d had ‎made concerning that subject. The line commencing with ‎ויעש ‏ה'‏‎, “G’d carried out, etc.” is a reminder that what follows is ‎merely the fulfillment of something that had been promised ‎much earlier.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 27_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎21,8. <b>“Avraham made a great feast on the day Yitzchok was weaned.”</b> The ‎דעת זקנים ‏מבעלי התוספות‎ comments on this verse that the words ‎ביום הגמל‎ may be broken up into several ‎parts, i.e. ‎ביום ה ג מל‎ alluding to the fact that the letter ‎ה‎ had been added to Avram’s name on ‎the day of his circumcision.

        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 18_Paragraph": "Once he had moved to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, where he served G’d ‎by performing mitzvot with his limbs, the situation changed, and ‎this is what made Rashi comment that the words: ‎לך לך מארצך‎, ‎mean that he was to undertake this journey for his gratification ‎and personal benefit, ‎להנאתך ולטובתך‎. <small>[If that were not the ‎meaning, we would ask how being told to uproot himself could be ‎for his personal benefit. He had seemed to be quite at ease and ‎content in Charan. Ed.]</small> Incidentally, this answers the query raised ‎by Rash’ba why Yaakov married two sisters while they were both ‎alive, something that is forbidden according to the Torah, and the ‎patriarchs are presumed to have observed Torah laws in their ‎time. Since service of the Lord while outside the boundaries of ‎Eretz Yisrael did not consist of the body’s limbs fulfilling the ‎commandments, and it was therefore impossible to perform these ‎commandments, there was nothing wrong with marrying two ‎sisters. This also explains why one of these sisters had to die once ‎Yaakov had crossed back into <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. He would not ‎have violated the commandment even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> when ‎he married Leah, so that it was Rachel who would live “in sin” ‎with him in the Holy Land unless she had been immediately ‎divorced. Close scrutiny of what the Rash’ba wrote shows that he ‎gave due consideration to this.‎<br>Someone who serves the Lord under the auspices of the ‎אין‎ ‎parts of the universe, is granted a clear vision of G’d, whereas ‎serving the Lord under the auspices of the ‎יש‎, results in such a ‎person being given an <i>aspaklaria, meurpelet</i>, a vision ‎screened by a veil. Association with the ‎יש‎, i.e. aspects of the ‎material part of the universe, results in all of one’s sensations ‎being affected by phenomena found only in this domain of the ‎universe.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 20_Paragraph": "This is also the meaning of the <i>Midrash</i> (<i>Baba ‎batra</i> 16,) according to which Avraham wore a necklace ‎featuring a jewel around his neck that miraculously healed sick ‎people when they looked at it. According to this <i>Midrash</i>, ‎after Avraham died, G’d suspended this jewel in the solar orbit. ‎Rabbi Shimon, the author of that <i>Midrash</i>, used it as a ‎parable explaining how beneficial it was for a sick person to come ‎within the field of vision of Avraham. This was so important a ‎feature of Avraham’s personality that G’d could not allow it to die ‎with him, and He equipped the sun with therapeutic qualities.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 30_Paragraph": "Still another method of understanding our paragraph, and ‎especially the manner in which it is introduced: Service of the ‎Lord may be predicated on one of two considerations. 1) The ‎person concerned, using his power of reasoning, has come to the ‎conclusion that the universe did not create itself but was created ‎by a Superior intellect, an intellect that is many times superior to ‎the human intellect. It seems clear to such a person that such a ‎Creator deserves to be worshipped. 2) Another reason why some ‎people worship G’d as the Creator and Master is that G’d has ‎endowed them with a special divine inspiration, commonly ‎known as ‎סייעתא דשמיא‎, an assist originating in the celestial ‎regions. The former type of person has formulated in his mind’s ‎eye some notion of the essence of such a Creator; the latter type ‎of person, while loyal, has not formed any notion of what this ‎Creator may be like. The former type of individual, having arrived ‎at certain conclusions, is able to communicate them to other ‎people and possibly convince them to share his views so that ‎these people too become servants of the Lord. The second ‎category of individual lacks this ability to convince others to be ‎like him, as he cannot explain to them rationally why he is ‎convinced that he is on the right path. Avram had by now ‎attained a level of intelligence, ‎במחזה‎, that enabled him to get a ‎fairly clear vision of what G’d, the Creator of a universe, is like. ‎Having attained insights, -not unlike a father who hands down to ‎his son his insights- he could now be informed that he would also ‎be blessed with physical offspring, parallel to the intellectual ‎achievements that he had to his credit due to his own efforts.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 9_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 6,14. <b>“you are to construct ‎compartments in the ark.”</b> The word ‎קנים‎ is the plural mode of ‎the word ‎קן‎, “nest,” as in “bird’s nest.” In other words, the ark ‎was to serve as a residence for all the creatures within it. The ‎word ‎תיבה‎ does not only mean “ark,” but also means: “word.” G’d ‎tells Noach that all his activities, would be confined to the inside ‎of the ark, including speech which would be taking place inside ‎it, including prayer.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 26_Paragraph": "Rabbi Yitzchok in <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 56,2 comments on ‎this as follows: “the only reason that Avraham was able to keep ‎his promise to the lads that he would return from Mount Moriah ‎‎(alive), is that he prostrated himself there before the Lord, <small>‎‎[something beyond what the Lord had asked of him when He ‎commanded him to offer his son Yitzchok as a burnt offering.” ‎Ed.]</small> This is why hundreds of years later his descendants were ‎redeemed from Egypt, as G’d explained to Moses in Exodus 3,12 ‎and as the Israelites did in Exodus 4,31. This ‎השתחויה‎, ‎‎“prostration before the Lord,” symbolized that the person doing ‎so abandoned any claim that he might have had to the material ‎benefits that life on earth offers. This is also what enables G’d to ‎‎“sweeten” i.e. remove the sting, of any judgments man is ‎subjected to by the attribute of Justice. Avraham’s example of ‎reducing himself to ‎אין‎ or ‎אפס‎, “nothing,” paved the way for his ‎descendants to emulate him and to be redeemed from the yoke of ‎the Egyptians who had effectively reduced them to a similar state ‎of having to negate the attractions this world offered to others.‎<br>The Torah itself was only given to the Jewish people because ‎they voluntarily repeated this ‎השתחויה‎, prostrating themselves ‎before the Lord, as we know from Exodus 24,1 where all the elite ‎of the Jewish people are reported as having prostrated themselves ‎some distance away from Mount Sinai. <small>[That chapter, though ‎written after the revelation, describes events that occurred before ‎the revelation, Ed.]</small> The elite negating their claims on the material ‎benefits this world has to offer, made it possible for coming so ‎close to G’d during the revelation that He addressed them as if He ‎were speaking to an equal. In psalms 99,9 when Moses (the ‎author of this psalm) says: ‎רוממו ה' אלוקינו והשתחוו להר קדשו‎, ‎‎“Exalt the Lord our G’d and prostrate yourselves at the Mountain ‎of His holiness;” similar verses are found in Isaiah 27,13, and ‎Samuel I 1,19 where the wording is almost identical. Rabbi ‎Yitzchok concludes by saying that the resurrection when it will ‎occur, does so only in recognition of these voluntary prostrations ‎of the Jewish people on various occasions when they ‎demonstrated their absolute submission to G’d and His will. If we ‎needed proof of this we find in in Isaiah 27,13 where we read ‎והיה ‏ביום ההוא יתקע בשופר גדול ובאו האובדים בארץ אשור והנדכים בארץ ‏מצרים והשתחוו לה' בהר הקודש בירושלים‎, “it will be on that Day, ‎when a great ram’s horn will be sounded, and the strayed who are ‎in the land of Assyria, and the expelled who are in the land of ‎Egypt, shall come and prostrate themselves on the holy Mountain ‎in Jerusalem.”", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 12_Paragraph": "Geneis 6:15 <b>“the length of the ark is to be 300 cubits, its ‎width 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits.”</b><small>[The author ‎continues with the allegorical approach to the data provided by ‎the Torah, presumably because it is clear that the Torah, when ‎providing us with these measurements, intended to convey more ‎than merely the bare facts. Ed.]‎</small><br>Whenever a human being makes use of the ability to ‎communicate his thoughts by articulating them, he must first ‎and foremost remember the exalted position of his Creator, the ‎One, Who had endowed him with the power of speech. Having ‎done so, he will likely relate to the Creator with the appropriate ‎amount of awe and love. Subsequent to this, he may appreciate ‎the conveniences G’d’s puts at the disposal of His creatures in this ‎physical universe. The measurements of the ark listed here ‎contain allusions to the three ethical imperatives just mentioned. ‎The measurement given for the height of the ark alludes to G’d’s ‎exalted position G’d occupies  in His universe. The width is an ‎allusion to the love and reverence for the Creator due Him; in ‎terrestrial terms this is expressed by the direction north-south; ‎finally, the availability of the various conveniences for man that ‎G’d has provided is alluded to by the description of the length of ‎the ark, i.e. the direction east-west.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 7_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎24,7. <b>“do not bring my son back there under any ‎circumstances.!”</b> We find that G’d confirmed Avraham’s ‎attittude concerning Yitzchok not leaving the soil of The Holy ‎Land, when He said to Yitzchok (Genesis 26,2) ‎אל תרד מצרימה, שכון ‏בארץ..גור בארץ הזאת‎, “do not go down to Egypt; reside in the ‎Land…even if you have to be a transient in this land!”<br>We ‎have a standing rule according to which it is permissible to be ‎afraid of something or someone bigger than oneself, whereas it is ‎forbidden to be afraid of someone smaller than oneself. In other ‎words, whereas it is permissible to be afraid of G’d, it is not ‎permissible to be afraid of anyone other than G’d. This is why all ‎manner of idol worship is prohibited.‎<br>The attribute of love enables one to love those who are ‎‎“smaller” than we are, notably the members of our household ‎who depend on us. When we keep this rule in mind we will be ‎able to understand a story in the Talmud <i>Kiddushin</i> 57 ‎where it is related that Shimon ben Ammasuni undertook to ‎explain the meaning of each word ‎את‎ in the Torah, proving that ‎the word invariably includes something that the Torah had not ‎spelled out specifically. However, when he came to the line ‎‎(Deuteronomy 6,13) ‎את ה' אלוקיך תירא‎, “you are to revere the Lord ‎your G’d,” he was stymied, not knowing what the word ‎את‎ in that ‎line could possibly add, as it is forbidden to revere anyone other ‎than the Lord. His students asked him if he thought that all the ‎explanations that he had found for the other times that the word ‎את‎ occurs should be disregarded? He replied that “just as the ‎Torah promises a reward for explaining its intricacies, so it ‎rewards those who refrain from offering explanations that are not ‎appropriate.” In the meantime, Rabbi Akiva who had heard of ‎Shimon ben Ammasuni’s dilemma, said that even this ‎את‎ added ‎an additional meaning to the verse in which it appeared, ‎suggesting that the Torah scholars deserve to be revered also. ‎Rabbi Akiva was able to offer this explanation since Torah ‎scholars are “greater” than the ordinary people consulting them, ‎so that they fit the principle that it is allowed to revere, be in awe ‎of, people that are greater than oneself. This is a basic difference ‎between the attribute of reverence, ‎יראה‎, and the attribute of ‎אהבה‎, love. While it is in order to say: “I am afraid of you,” to ‎someone more powerful than oneself, a king for instance, it is not ‎in order to say to such a king: “I love you.” It is, however, ‎permissible to say to such a king: “I love to be in your house,” “I ‎love to serve you,” etc.<br>The above distinction explains why Shimon ben Amassuni ‎had not found a problem with the word ‎את‎ in Deuteronomy 6,5 ‎where the Torah writes: ‎ואהבת את ה' אלוקיך‎, “you shall love the ‎Lord your G’d.” He understood this verse as not applying to G’d’s ‎essence, but to attributes of G’d, attributes worth emulating ‎because they make Him lovable. This is also why Rabbi Akiva was ‎able to resolve his difficulty when he suggested that reverence for ‎Torah scholars, who are an extension of G’d from Whom they ‎received their knowledge and stature, therefore qualify for a ‎portion of reverence that is due to their Master. Seeing that the ‎Torah scholar is a servant of G’d, he too is entitled to some of his ‎Master’s reflected glory.‎<br>Avraham’s major attribute was ‎אהבה‎, his love for people. This ‎attribute included even in their concerns with matters that did ‎not involve their relations to the Creator. This being so, G’d did ‎not object to his descending to Egypt, leaving the soil of the Holy ‎Land. His son Yitzchok’s primary attribute was ‎יראה‎, reverence ‎for the Essence of G’d; i.e. he concentrated all his faculties on how ‎to serve G’d. This being so, it would have interfered with his basic ‎character were he to leave the sacred soil of the land of Israel for ‎even a short period.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 21_Paragraph": "When reflecting on all this we must not lose sight of the fact ‎that Eliezer at that time had been in the service of Avraham for ‎more than an average person’s lifetime, and had certainly learned ‎to admire his master’s outstanding virtues. If Avraham entrusted ‎this servant with choosing a wife for his son, the sole heir of his ‎spiritual wealth, and insisted that such a wife be a member of his ‎family, i.e. Terach’s family, with whose polytheism he was ‎thoroughly familiar, he was aware of the challenge posed by the ‎mission he had undertaken, and that is why he prayed to G’d ‎הקרה נא ..ועשה חסד עם אדוני אברהם‎. ", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 24_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 24,63. <b>“Yitzchok took a walk to meditate in the open ‎field;”</b> It is a rule that people who practice submissiveness, (in ‎the sense of humility) are liable to become depressed, due to the ‎constant awareness that they cannot act freely in accordance ‎with their desires, as they constantly defer to the wishes of ‎others. When a person reserves his submissiveness <i>vis a vis</i> ‎his Creator, by serving Him exclusively, he thereby attaches ‎himself to the source of Joy. It follows that instead of becoming ‎morose and depressed, he will walk through life in a spirit of ‎happiness and joy. Our verse alludes to this psychological ‎phenomenon, the word ‎לשוח‎, being an alternate for ‎שמחה‎, joy. ‎Yitzchok’s taking a stroll was intended to fill his heart with joy. In ‎the field he would be able to communicate with his Creator, i.e. ‎with Holiness. Becoming associated with Holiness would engender ‎feelings of joy within him.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 13_Paragraph": "Another way of looking at the line: ‎אם תעשה עמנו רעה כאשר ‏לא נגענוך וגו'‏‎, adding the words: ‎אתע עתה ברוך ה'‏‎, “you are now ‎in the position of being blessed by the Lord,” it appears that ‎Avimelech now demanded that just as he had done favours for ‎Yitzchok, it was now Yitzchok’s turn to reciprocate these ‎favours. At first glance it sounds incomprehensible that Yitzchok ‎has to return favours to Avimelech when the latter, by his own ‎admission, had only not harmed Yitzchok because he was afraid of ‎retribution from Yitzchok’s G’d. He had learned the lesson that ‎everyone had to learn who had ever tried to harm any of our ‎patriarchs.‎<br>The righteous had never wanted that these people be ‎destroyed; if this had been the result of their planning harm ‎against the patriarchs, this was something G’d had decided in His ‎own wisdom, without prompting by the intended victims. The ‎‎<i>tzaddikim</i> are concerned with G’d rewarding those who ‎show them fairness in their dealings with them. The ‎‎<i>tzaddikim</i> have the welfare of mankind at heart. Avimelech ‎was arrogant or dishonest enough to try and make Yitzchok ‎believe that he had been a free agent when doing favours for ‎Yitzchok, and that he had not been under pressure by G’d to do ‎so. Avimelech argued that whatever his original intention, the ‎fact remained that Yitzckok now enjoyed G’d’s blessings, and that ‎they had been the instruments G’d had used to bestow these ‎blessings upon him. A person who has been described as “blessed ‎by the Lord,” must never become the cause of other human ‎beings coming to harm through anything he does. It therefore is ‎his duty to repay favours that he had experienced while ‎sojourning in the land of the Philistines. ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 5_Paragraph": "This is also the meaning of psalms ‎‎119,98 ‎מאויבי תחכמני מצותך כי לעולם היא לי‎, “Your commandments ‎made me wiser than my enemies; they always stand by me.” The ‎letter ‎מ‎ in the word ‎מאויבי‎ must be understood in the sense of ‎‎“more than.” When read thus, the word is a reference to the evil ‎urge, which is not only David’s enemy, but the enemy of every ‎human being, implanting within us the powerful desires to taste ‎the gratifications advertised. However, the psalmist, upon ‎reflecting that what is eternal must be far more worthwhile than ‎that which is merely transient, redoubles his resolve to serve only ‎the Creator, rejecting the deceptive allure of physical delights. ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 28_Paragraph": "The reference to ‎גמלים באים‎ “camels approaching,” is not to ‎be understood literally, according to our author, but as a simile ‎meaning the same as ‎גומל‎ in our daily ‎עמידה‎ prayer, where it ‎means that G’d responds to kindness with more ‎kindness.<br>Another way of understanding the line: ‎וירא והנה ‏גמלים באים‎, is that the righteous who serve the Lord truly ‎experience a feeling of transcendental satisfaction from doing so ‎even while still in this imperfect world which our bodies inhabit. ‎Rivkah experienced an echo of this, and this is what is meant ‎when the Torah reports her reaction to seeing her future ‎husband Yitzchok for the first time; ‎ותפול מעל הגמל‎, normally ‎translated as “she fell from the camel,” has to be understood as ‎similar to Genesis 25,19 where the word the words ‎על פני כל אחיו ‏נפל‎ has to be understood as “he (Ishmael) landed;” parallel to this ‎we read here that Rivkah landed above the “camel,” i.e. in loftier ‎spiritual regions. She perceived for the first time the “taste” of ‎serving the Creator based on super-terrestrial dimensions.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 25_Paragraph": "Another aspect of why the Torah tells us that Yitzchok chose ‎to stroll in the field, is provided by the additional detail of the ‎time of day when this occurred, i.e. shortly before sunset, i.e. ‎לפנות ערב‎. Our sages (<i>Pessachim</i> 119) give some examples of how ‎G’d’s viewing matters differs from the way His creatures, human ‎beings, view the same matters. Example: When one of G’d’s ‎creatures suffers a defeat, he reacts by being saddened and ‎becoming depressed. G’d, on the other hand, is overjoyed when ‎one of His creatures prevails in a discussion with Him. When G’d ‎had originally suggested that Moses become a substitute for the ‎Jewish people whom He intended to destroy after the episode ‎with the golden calf, and Moses pointed out to him that this ‎would not be a good idea, as the chances of a new Jewish people ‎with only one founding father, himself, being better than the ‎previous Jewish people who had three founding fathers were very ‎slim, G’d was overjoyed to accept Moses’ argument as superior to ‎His own. (Compare psalms 4,1 where David alludes to this) The ‎Midrash (<i>Tanchuma Ki Tavo</i> 1) takes this thought even further by ‎generalizing that ”G’d issues decrees and the righteous on earth ‎cancel these decrees.”‎<br>When G’d was guiding His universe before having created ‎man, He did so all by Himself. He did not need to take into ‎consideration how His creatures would view His actions, i.e. His ‎will reigned supreme. Once He had created free willed human ‎beings, He had to seriously consider how the righteous among ‎them would view His actions. Our sages allude to this when they ‎said: (Bereshit Rabbah 19,7 ‎עקר שכינה בתחתונים‎, (loosely translated) ‎‎“G’d’s presence is occupied primarily with His creatures in the ‎‎‘lower’ part of the universe,” <small>[i.e. He has to justify Himself to the ‎righteous people on earth. Ed.]</small><br>This principle of G’d’s involvement in man’s pursuits not ‎merely being restricted to viewing it from the celestial regions, is ‎documented in Exodus 19,20 ‎וירד ה' על הר סיני‎, “<i>Hashem</i> ‎descended on Mount Sinai., etc.” What was the reason that G’d ‎saw fit to leave the lofty spheres of heaven? He prepared to act in ‎accordance with what the ‎צדיקים‎, the righteous expected from ‎Him. Being able to set the minds of His righteous at rest is the ‎greatest satisfaction that G’d, their Creator, can experience.<br>In our portion, this is alluded to when the Torah describes ‎Yitzchok as meditating in “the field,” or, <small>[in the words of our ‎sages ]</small> “Avraham viewed G’d as ‘a mountain;’ Yitzchok viewed ‎Him as a ‘field,’ whereas Yaakov viewed Him as a ‘house;’ this is ‎why he promised to build a “house for Him.” The <i>tzaddikim</i> ‎learned to become progressively more familiar with G’d. <small>[The ‎anecdotes about our author that are appended to his ‎commentary on the Torah, reflect the fact that the author was no ‎exception to this rule. Ed.]</small> Being able to feel close to G’d, i.e. on ‎the field, enabled Yitzchok, whose very name symbolized joy, ‎laughter, to become more intimate with his Creator. The word ‎שדה‎ is also known as ‎חקל‎, “(as in ‎חקלאות‎ the pursuit of ‎agriculture.) [The author describes the righteous as being ‎described as ‎שדה חקל‎, but I have not been able to find the source ‎for this. ‎‎‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 8_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 25,26. <b>“while his hand was holding on to Esau’s heel.”</b> I ‎assume that the reader is aware that Satan, <small>[also known as the ‎angel of death, Esau himself describing himself as headed for ‎death, Ed.]</small> is considered as the protective guardian of Esau. ‎Yaakov was bent on vanquishing this force, (also known as the ‎poison resulting in death) so that this force would not overwhelm ‎us, his descendants. It is noteworthy that the numerical value of ‎the word ‎עקב‎ (172) is twice the numerical value of the attribute ‎of Justice, ‎אלוהים‎ (86). Symbolically speaking, Yaakov used this ‎numerical superiority of the letters in his name to challenge the ‎supremacy of Justice when not tempered by Mercy.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 30_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎25,13. <b>“And these are the names of Yishmael’s children ‎according to their names and their further developments.”</b> ‎According to <i>Rashi</i> the line is to be understood as the Torah ‎recording the names in the chronological order in which they ‎were born. The reason why <i>Rashi</i> emphasizes this is because ‎there are numerous occasions when the Torah does not list the ‎name of the children in this order, for instance: Genesis 9,18 ‎when the Torah lists the names of Noach’s sons as ‎שם, חם, ויפת‎, ‎naming ‎שם‎ first, although Yaphet was the firstborn. Similarly, in ‎Genesis 25,9 where Avraham’s burial is described, Yitzchok is ‎mentioned ahead of his older brother Yishmael as he was the ‎more righteous of the two.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 46_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎17,4., “<b>I, here My covenant is with you; you will become ‎‎(founder) of a multitude of nations.”</b> The principal task of the ‎‎<i>tzaddik’s</i> service of the Lord is to ascend spiritually to ‎higher levels, so that the entire human race residing in the ‎‎“lower” part of the universe is elevated. The <i>Zohar</i> ‎expressed this by writing: “we need to be able to make an ‎appearance, facing the King.” It is clear that there is a danger that ‎when the <i>tzaddik</i>, (Avraham) in order to fulfill the mission ‎of founding numerous nations, has to descend to the ‎moral/ethical level of these people in order to subsequently ‎elevate them, he faces the danger of becoming submerged among ‎them instead. Avraham was keenly aware of that. Here G’d assures ‎him that He will protect him against these dangers as His ‎covenant will accompany Avraham all the way when he ‎undertakes “outreach.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 15_Paragraph": "An alternative explanation of G’d’s directive to take along ‎provisions. <small>[The following is based on the Torah choosing the ‎word ‎מאכל‎ instead of the customary word ‎אוכל‎, for food. Ed.]</small> ‎‎(Compare Genesis 41,35; 41,48; 42,7 et al) By using the causative ‎mode, ‎מאכל‎ as in ‎מאכיל‎, the Torah suggests that G’d made it ‎Noach’s task to feed others, primarily the animals, of course. ‎When understanding the word ‎מאכל‎ in this way, a commentary ‎by <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 19,12 becomes clearer. Rabbi Abahu ‎there draws our attention to Adam when challenged by G’d ‎‎(Genesis 3,12) if he came by the knowledge that he was nude ‎because he had eaten from the tree that G’d had forbidden him to ‎eat, having said: ‎האשה אשר נתת עמדי הוא נתנה לי מן העץ ואכל‎, “the ‎woman that You have given me to be my mate, she gave me from ‎the tree vaochel”. Adam used the future tense when describing his ‎having eaten instead of saying ‎אכלתי‎, “I ate.” The author of the ‎‎<i>midrash</i> sees in this Adam’s implied promise to repair ‎whatever damage he had done by eating the forbidden fruit, by in ‎future pronouncing a blessing before partaking of anything that ‎G’d put at man’s disposal in this universe. He hoped to undo any ‎harm his eating from the tree of knowledge had done. When ‎Adam’s eating from the tree is looked at in this light, he had ‎indeed “fed” the human beings that were born after him, by ‎bequeathing them a world that they could call their own. This ‎was confirmed by G’d at the moment when He told Noach ‎קח לך ‏מכל מאכל אשר יאכל‎, “Take for yourself of all the food that is ‎fit to be eaten.” Noach’s taking with him all the animals into the ‎ark set the stage for man’s being permitted to eat the meat of ‎animals after they had died and become fit as food. This is also the ‎allusion contained in Yoel 2,26 ‎ואכלתם אכול‎, “and you will eat ‎your fill (and praise the name of the Lord).” The repetition of the ‎word ‎אכול‎ is the veiled reference to Adam’s having been ‎responsible for all this in a constructive sense. <small>[This editor views ‎this <i>midrash</i> as especially inspiring, as it suggests that ‎Adam himself “invented” the principle of the punishment ‎having to fit the crime. Ed.]‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 13_Paragraph": "This point is made even more clearly in Genesis 13,14 where ‎we read: ‎וה' אמר אל אברם אחרי הפרד לוט מעמו שא נא עיניך וראה מן ‏המקום אשר אתה שם צפונה ונגבה וקדמה וימה‎, \"and the Lord had said to ‎Avram after Lot had separated from him ‘raise your eyes and look ‎northward, southward, eastward and westward;’” this was a ‎promise first and foremost that he would see in his lifetime three ‎of the patriarchs of the Jewish people, i.e. himself, Yitzchok, and ‎Yaakov. The first three directions mentioned here symbolize the ‎attributes ‎חסד‎ ‎‏, גבורה, ‏and ‎תפארת‎, referring to Avraham, Yitzchok ‎and Yaakov in that order.<br>When telling Avraham that he ‎would see ‎את כל הארץ‎, “the whole of the land” (future Eretz ‎Yisrael), this refers to David, whose attribute is ‎מלכות‎, Royalty, ‎David representing this symbol on earth, the Jewish people. David ‎is directly linked to the patriarch Avraham, was shown “the ‎whole land,” so that he would be aware that the glory of the ‎Kingdom of David would be directly traceable to him. This is the ‎reason why north and south, east and west are listed here in this ‎order. According to <i>Ari za’l</i>, ‎ימה‎, “west,” refers to the ‎emanation ‎יסוד‎, the emanation directly above the emanation ‎מלכות‎, the one symbolized by the kingdom of ‎David.<br><small>[<i>Malchut</i>, as the “lowest” of the emanations, is ‎the one closest to the physical universe. Rabbi Elie Munk (Ascent ‎to Harmony) has described the emanation <i>Malchut</i> as ‎‎“History” (of man), thus seeing it as the bridge between the ‎actual physical universe and the celestial domains, since when ‎something becomes “history,” it has either receded or ascended ‎‎(depending on whether the persons making history made ‎constructive or destructive contributions) to a domain beyond ‎the physical but robbing it of the “substance” common to ‎phenomena in the earthly domain of the universe. ‎Ed.]</small><br>According to the Zohar, <i>tzaddik</i> and <i>tzedek</i>, ‎the righteous person and the performance of righteous deeds, are ‎indivisible, i.e. the emanations ‎מלכות‎ and ‎יסוד‎ always go hand in ‎hand. We find this concept first alluded to in the Torah when ‎‎<i>Malki Tzedek</i>, King of Shalem, (Jerusalem) in Genesis 14,18 ‎congratulates Avram on his victory, blesses him in the name of ‎the Lord, and presents him with bread and wine. The word ‎לחם‎, ‎commonly understood as “bread,” is used to describe ‎חכמה‎, ‎‎“wisdom,” whereas the word ‎יין‎, commonly understood as “wine” ‎means ‎בינה‎, “insight,” in this context. Malki Tzedek presented ‎these items as symbols of the two highest emanations man can ‎usually attain, both of which Avraham employed in his service of ‎the Lord. <br><small>[As on previous occasions, the author sees in such ‎apparently irrelevant details as a King bringing bread and wine ‎from hundreds of kilometers from Jerusalem. According to Genesis ‎‎14,15, Avraham had pursued the armies of Kedorleomer all the ‎way to Damascus) an allusion to something far more profound. ‎Ed.]</small><br>The <i>Zohar</i> I,199 traces the fact that a <i>tzaddik</i> ‎serves the Lord with ‎חכמה‎ and ‎בינה‎ to Job 28,28 ‎יראת ה' היא חכמה ‏וסור מרע בינה‎, “Reverence for the Lord is wisdom, to shun evil is ‎understanding, insight.” The two blessings that Malki Tzedek, ‎who was viewed as G’d’s High Priest in those days, most likely ‎Shem, Noach’s oldest son, bestowed on Avram, represent the two ‎emanations that Avram had been able to use in his service of the ‎Lord, and are reflected in Targum Yonathan’s translation of the ‎Torah, in the first verses of the Torah in which they appear. <small>[In ‎our verses, instead of commending Avraham to G’d, as we would ‎translate the words ‎ברוך אברם ל..‏‎, Yonathan ben Uzziel translates: ‎ברוך אברם מ...‏‎, “Avram has been blessed by the supreme G’d, etc.” ‎Ed.]</small> Targum Yerushalmi translates already the first words of the ‎Torah, i.e. ‎בראשית ברא אלוקים את השמים ואת הארץ‎, as “in the ‎beginning G’d used the emanation of ‎חכמה‎ to create heaven and ‎earth.” ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 0_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎25,19 <b>“And these are the generations of Yitzchok, the son ‎of Avraham; Avraham begot Yitzchok.”</b> (We have been told in ‎Genesis 21,12 ‎כי ביצחק יקרא לך זרע‎, “for your seed (descendants) ‎will be known through Yitzchok.” G’d told Avraham already ‎before Yitzchok was born that although he had another son, ‎Yishmael, his descendants would always be associated with ‎Yitzchok. It was understood that this promise was contingent on ‎Yitzchok becoming a righteous person, a <i>tzaddik</i>, future ‎generations would not trace themselves back to their ancestor ‎Avraham but each generation would only trace itself back to their ‎immediate forbears, i.e. their fathers. In other words, the new ‎element provided by our verse above is that even Yitzchok’s ‎offspring would trace themselves back to their founding patriarch ‎Avraham. We learn from here also that it is up to the “son” to ‎demonstrate by his deeds that he was not only descended from ‎his father but could claim previous generations as his “roots.” ‎When we consider this, the word ‎תולדה‎ is no longer an adjective, ‎an attribute of a person which he came by naturally, without any ‎input of his own, but it is a tribute to the person so described, ‎meaning that he is a worthy descendant of his illustrious forbears.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 31_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 22,7. Concerning Yitzchok’s question of <b>“here is the fire and ‎the kindling, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?,”</b> ‎it seems that Yitzchok’s question implied that seeing the ‎principal purpose of his father’s trial was to see if he was ‎prepared to slaughter his son, what need was there for fire and ‎kindling, seeing that after he had been slaughtered surely it did ‎not matter to G’d if his remains would be burned up! Yitzchok ‎wanted his father to know that the kindling and the fire had ‎nothing to do with him, as the intended victim. He wanted to ‎know if there was going to be another offering, i.e. a lamb, as ‎usual. If so, where did his father expect to find it at short notice? ‎When we understand Yitzchok’s question as suggested, we can ‎understand why he did not ask a question concerning the knife to ‎be used in the slaughter. Avraham’s reply, saying that G’d would ‎select who should be the “lamb,” meant that as far his ‎relationship to G’d was concerned, his own son was as valuable to ‎him as if he would burn up an actual lamb for G’d in order to ‎demonstrate his love for Him.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 34_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 22,12. <b>“for now I know that you are G’d fearing, seeing you ‎have not withheld your only son from Me.”</b> It appears, based ‎on this verse, that there are two types of fear of the Lord. One ‎type is based on a person’s understanding the meaning of the ‎commandment that he performs, i.e. it makes sense to him. The ‎second type of fear of the Lord is shown when he fulfills ‎commandments whose purpose he had not been able to ‎understand. When someone performs commandments without ‎knowing their meaning, his level of fearing G’d is on a higher ‎rung than the person who does so because he believes that he ‎understands the reason why G’d has demanded fulfillment of that ‎commandment, and he “agrees” with G’d. When the latter person ‎observes a commandment, it is not clear that he does so out of ‎love for G’d, as he may be doing so because he feels he is doing ‎himself a favour, as the commandment is logical, and clearly in ‎the interest of mankind as a whole.<br>Before the angel said to ‎Avraham: “do not touch and harm the lad,” people had thought ‎that surely the reason why Avraham set out to do this was ‎because he thought he understood G’d’s reason for issuing such a ‎commandment.<br>After he was now commanded not to proceed, ‎it would be clear to everybody that Avraham had not understood ‎the reason for G’d’s command, as if he had been correct in what ‎he thought, G’d could not have cancelled the command. What ‎had been a valid consideration could not suddenly have become ‎an invalid consideration! Therefore it had emerged retroactively ‎that when Avraham had begun to carry out the commandment ‎to offer Yitzchok as a burnt offering, he had been motivated only ‎by his love for G’d, and how could he possibly refuse the ‎command given by a G’d Whom he loved!? By cancelling His ‎command G’d had demonstrated that there had never been a ‎rationale for such a command. The trial of Avraham had consisted ‎in his performing even a totally irrational command.<br>The only ‎reason for issuing such a command was the desire of G’d to prove ‎that Avraham would not be deterred by the absence of a valid ‎reason for Yitzchok having to die on the altar. All of this is ‎implied in the angel saying: “now I have seen, etc.;” it does not ‎mean that G’d had not known up to now. It means that this was ‎the only way in which G’d had been able to demonstrate to the ‎world what He had known about Avraham’s potential to perform ‎such an act for no other reason than that He loved Gd.", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 25_Paragraph": "When Moses, in Deuteronomy 32,2 describes G’d as ‎וזרח משעיר ‏למו הופיע מהר פארן‎, “the Lord shone upon them from Seir, He ‎appeared from Mount Paran,” every intelligent person must ask ‎that Esau and Yaakov had been separated already prior to their ‎respective births, and that the two represented two totally ‎opposite perceptions of what life and the world is all about, one ‎deciding in favour of worldly goods, whereas Yaakov decided in ‎favour of spiritual values, so what point was there in G’d offering ‎the Torah to the descendants of Esau? At the same time, since ‎when do we the descendants of Yaakov, expect to have a share in ‎G’d’s largesse on this earth? Does the Talmud <i>Kidushin</i>: 39 ‎not teach us not to expect a reward for serving the Lord while we ‎walk on this earth?‎<br>The answer to this question is this: Every Israelite is obligated ‎by being part of the covenant between Israel and G’d, to serve the ‎Lord enthusiastically and meticulously with all his soul at all ‎times. Just as G’d supervises his well being every minute of every ‎hour, so, in turn he is obliged to serve the Lord. When G’d on ‎occasion supplies a Jew with material benefits, these are not to be ‎understood as part of the reward for his <i>mitzvah</i> ‎performance. It may be understood as an encouragement to the ‎person concerned, to serve the Lord with even greater devotion ‎and intensity. When Moses speaks of ‎מימינו אש דת למו‎, “from His ‎right side the fire had turned into law,” he meant that if G’d ‎decided to give the Jewish people, or some of the Jewish people, ‎part of the material comforts that had originally been allocated to ‎Seir, i.e. Esau, He referred to G’d’s “right side”, the side exuding ‎love. G’d intended that by doing so even the ordinary Jew who is ‎not steeped in Torah learning will respond to G’d’s Torah with ‎more enthusiasm when he feels that G’d had singled him out for ‎loving care.‎<br>This is one of the reasons why Avraham called his son ‎Yitzchok, the name reflecting the joy he felt at being granted this ‎son by Sarah. If Yitzchok developed into a personality ‎symbolizing ‎יראה‎, awe, this was because he was rooted in ‎שמחה‎, ‎joy, and joy‘s root in turn is fire. [If I understand the author ‎correctly, the joy described as “fire” is the enthusiasm, almost ‎ecstasy, with which such a person serves his G’d. Ed]. The ‎characteristic ‎יראה‎ is not one that is manifest in the person who ‎possesses it all the time, as it is in the nature of being a response ‎to certain stimuli, in this instance the external “cause” is G’d ‎Himself. This characteristic becomes manifest in response to ‎external stimulants. This is what Solomon had in mind when he ‎said in <i>Kohelet</i> 7,12 ‎ויתרון דעת חכמה תחיה בעליה‎, ”and the ‎advantage of knowledge is that it adds an additional dimension to ‎the life of him who possesses it..”‎<br>It is significant that the letters in the word ‎מחשבה‎, “thought,” ‎are the same as in the word ‎בשמחה‎,”with joy.”‎מחשבה ‏‎ is an ‎attribute that is both primary and constant. If a person reduces ‎himself to the ‎אין‎, negating all interest in the physical part of the ‎world, having done this he is able to attach himself to the source ‎of all “Life.” When this has occurred, a new “LIFE” is bestowed on ‎him, a life in a different world, one in which he is elevated to be ‎close to Eternal G’d. This concept is portrayed in the Torah in ‎Leviticus 27,10 where the subject is the person who donates to ‎הקדש‎, G’d’s representative on earth, his “net worth,” as defined ‎according to his age. Having done so, the Torah there describes ‎him as ‎והיה הוא ותמורתו יהיה קודש‎, “then both he and his ‎substitute will be holy.” Concerning this procedure the sages in ‎the Jerusalem Talmud <i>B’rachot</i> 2,4 said: the messiah was ‎born on the 9th day of Av, he being the exchange for the Jewish ‎world which had been destroyed on that day (when the Temple ‎was burned). We find an allusion to this negating the physical ‎world and being “reincarnated,” when Avraham before ‎proceeding to offer his son Yitzchok as a total burnt offering, tells ‎the servants attending them, that “we will go, and prostrate ‎ourselves and return to you.” (Genesis 22,5)‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 19_Paragraph": "‎2) A second approach to understanding why the sages saw in ‎the word ‎בכל‎ in our verse a reference to Avraham’s possessing a ‎‎“daughter,” is based on our knowledge that Avraham related to ‎his Creator by serving him primarily with his attribute of ‎חסד‎, ‎loving kindness, a virtue that he had learned from his Creator. He ‎did not use this attribute in order to accumulate merits on his ‎own behalf, but in order to accumulate merits for the entire ‎Jewish people of whom he would become the founding father. He ‎laboured hard in order to implant this attribute in his ‎descendants. ‎<br>", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 36_Paragraph": "The belief that the thoughts that cross the minds of parents ‎engaged in marital intercourse influence the spiritual focus of a ‎child conceived as the result of their union, is universally ‎accepted in the writings of our sages, and especially so in ‎Nachmanides’ essay ‎האמונה והבטחון‎, chapter 15, page 395 in ‎כתבי ‏רמב'ן‎, published by Mossad Harav Kook. <small>[The authorship of this ‎volume has not been determined with accuracy even nowadays. ‎Rabbi Chayim David Chavell, whose edition I am using, devotes 11 ‎pages to his introduction when he explains that there is some ‎genetic spiritual input by both the father and the mother into ‎the soul of the child they produce. <br>If I understand the ‎message in these words, it is that this input is transmitted only at ‎the time when the parents conceive the child, and it outweighs ‎what the parents try to teach the youngster after he or she has ‎been born. It follows that if the parents are interested in ‎transmitting their own and their ancestors’ good characteristics ‎to their own children, they must not only live according to these ‎principles, but even conduct themselves according to these ‎principles in the privacy of their bedrooms. Perhaps this sheds ‎some light on the lament of many parents who have one or more ‎children who do not follow in their footsteps and who fail to ‎understand this. Ed.]</small><br> <i>Pessachim</i> 50 urging us to be ‎careful to perpetuate the good practices of our forefathers ‎meticulously, the Talmud quotes Proverbs 1,8 ‎שמע בני מוסר אביך ‏ואל תטוש תורת אמך‎, “my son, hear the moral instruction of your ‎father, and do not forsake the teachings of your mother.” It is ‎clear from the Torah’s description of Terach before he had sired ‎children (assuming he became a monotheist later) that the ‎thoughts we have described did not occur to him when he and his ‎wife conceived Avram. In fact, if Terach had been a believer in the ‎one and only G’d, much of the credit Avraham accumulated ‎would have been due to his father.<br>Avraham was the first ‎human being, who, by absorbing some of the “sparks” of the ‎‎<i>Shechinah</i> which we discussed on pages 21-22 was able to ‎transmit such spiritual values by means of his semen. He himself ‎had absorbed only the kind of material input from his father and ‎mother as is capable of being defined through DNA in our days. In ‎the parlance of our sages this input of physical matter by the ‎mother is known as ‎אודם‎, primarily cells which produce blood, ‎whereas the input by her male partner consists primarily of ‎לובן‎, ‎albumen.<br>Terach and his wife contributed only elements of ‎the material terrestrial part of the universe to the fetus of ‎Avraham, whereas G’d, anxious to see an eventual Jewish people ‎emerge from that embryo, contributed characteristics that ‎stemmed from the spiritual spheres of the universe. This is the ‎meaning of Avram’s question “how do I know that I will inherit?” ‎The word ‎דעת‎ or ‎ידע‎ always describes a close attachment to the ‎subject or object it describes. Avram wanted to know which ‎spiritual characteristic links him to his existence in the terrestrial ‎world, a link described in Proverbs 1,8 as ‎אבי‎ in the verse ‎שמע בני ‏מוסר אביך‎, in which Solomon cautions his listeners to carefully ‎perpetuate the moral lessons absorbed from ‎אביך‎, your father, i.e. ‎your roots. His question was prompted by his realization that he ‎could certainly not be expected to perpetuate the moral lessons ‎that he had been taught in the house of his father Terach. If he ‎were to do this, how could he possibly bequeath to his offspring ‎the qualities needed to become G’d’s people? He knew ‎instinctively that this could happen only if he had in his genes ‎spiritual input from a higher world. The characteristic that ‎represented this spiritual input is know as ‎אב‎, part of the name ‎אברהם‎. The word ‎ירושה‎, inheritance, is always used in connection ‎with inheritance from one’s father; hence seeing that the word ‎אב‎, father, was part of his name this was the link that enabled him ‎to become the first patriarch of the Jewish people. Avram ‎understood that the origin of the Jewish people, a concept in ‎G’d’s mind and the contribution He had made as the third partner ‎in any human being to Avram’s genes, were of the same kind, so ‎that the Jewish people could truly be described as having its ‎terrestrial root in Avraham, as he would be called shortly before ‎Yitzchok was born.<br>When G’d told him that he should realize ‎that his offspring would begin their collective life as “strangers,” ‎i.e. as a new nation in the families of nations, it was this strain ‎that he shared his spiritual origin with. He would henceforth ‎have to concentrate on his role as the spiritual root of that nation ‎as and when it would become such. G’d reminded him already in ‎verse 7 that this was the purpose for which He had saved him ‎from the fiery furnace in Ur Kasdim continuing this theme in ‎verse 18 when He entered into a sacred covenant with Avram. He ‎had given him a preview that the development of this nation of ‎which he would become the founding father, would undergo a ‎difficult “adolescence” and that these difficulties once endured ‎and overcome with His help would qualify them for their historic ‎mission as trailblazers of monotheism. Although Terach is ‎credited with having sired Avram, (Genesis 11,26) this was merely ‎a biological phenomenon; he was in no way an ancestor of Avram ‎in the sense that Avram as the son would continue a tradition ‎sacred to his father.To the question of how we are to understand ‎Genesis 15,15 ‎ואתה תבוא אל אבותיך בשלום תקבר בשיבה טובה‎, “as for ‎you, you will join your “fathers’ in peace and will be buried in a ‎ripe old age,” the word ‎אבותיך‎ does not refer to Terach; but is an ‎assurance that Avram would die without sharing the servitude his ‎descendants would experience.<br>The <i>Zohar I</i> 78 ‎commenting on Genesis 12,5 ‎ואת הנפש אשר עשו בחרן‎, writes that ‎Terach became a penitent, but that this does not mean that ‎Avraham would be reunited with his father in the life after death, ‎but since our sages had difficulty in how to understand the ‎words: ‎ואתה תבוא אל אבותיך בשלום‎, they understood this as Terach ‎sanctifying the name of Avraham’s G’d while still alive. The name ‎of “G’d” in that verse therefore is ‎אב‎, the spiritual genes that we ‎described above as having been injected by G’d into the ovum ‎that eventually developed into Avram.<br><small>[We may understand ‎this as Terach establishing a horizontal spiritual bond with his ‎son through his penitence instead of the vertical bond created ‎when a father passes on his spiritual values to his son. Ed.]</small><br>If ‎you find it difficult to accept the argument that Terach is not to ‎be regarded as Avram’s “father” in verse 15, consider the ‎following statement in <i>Yevamot</i> 22. ‎גר שנתגייר כקטן שנולד דמי‎, ‎‎“a convert after conversion is comparable to that of a newly born ‎baby.” He has no residue of the spiritual input normally ‎transmitted by the respective genes of his father and mother. The ‎only spiritual force active within him is that of the soul which has ‎been given to him by his Creator. He is no longer called after his ‎father, when called up to the Torah, the name of his father, the ‎gentile, is not even alluded to. The reason is that he no longer ‎contains the spiritual input his father had transmitted to him at ‎birth. The separation of such a convert from his biological father ‎is so absolute, that according to Biblical Jewish law the convert is ‎free to marry his biological mother, or sister, (assuming either of ‎them has converted). <small>[If the Rabbis forbade this, it is because it ‎raises suspicions that the conversion had ulterior motives. Ed.].</small> ‎Avram/Avraham both because he was a convert, and because his ‎name was changed by G’d before he sired Yitzchok, was no longer ‎connected to Terach at all. When the Torah writes in Genesis ‎‎25,19 ‎ואלה תולדות יצחק בן אברהם, אברהם הוליד את יצחק‎, “and these ‎are the generations of Yitzchok; son of Avraham; Avraham had ‎sired Yitzchok,” the Torah makes a point of describing Yitzchok ‎as descendant of Avraham, whereas it never described Avraham as ‎a descendant of Terach. The term “father,” is mentioned in the ‎Torah only in connection with the characteristic ‎אב‎ which G’d ‎had supplied to Avram, and which helped him to sanctify G’d’s ‎Holy name to large groups of people as we explained previously.", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 48_Paragraph": "Genesis 17,22., <b>“G’d ascended from above Avraham.”</b> In order to ‎understand the significance of what is written here we must go ‎back to Bereshit Rabbah 42 where Avraham is described as ‎consulting with his friends Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre, on his ‎having been commanded to circumcise himself. Two of his friends ‎advised against it, whereas Mamre reminded him that the G’d ‎Who had saved his life several times, would most certainly not ‎demand something of him that was not in his interest. Mamre ‎was rewarded for this by G’d. The point our author sees in our ‎verse is that Avraham was given an opportunity to refuse ‎carrying out this commandment, so that if he withstood the ‎temptation to do so he could receive an even greater reward for ‎having resisted the urgings of the evil urge, dressed up as “pious ‎advice.” G’d’s “ascending from ’above’ Avraham,” means that G’d ‎distanced Himself from Avraham for a while in order to give the ‎evil urge, Satan in the guise of two of his friends, an opportunity ‎to tempt him not to obey this commandment.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 29_Paragraph": "An alternative way of interpreting the line: ‎היה דבר ה' אל אברם ‏במחזה לאמור‎, “G’d’s word came to Avram in a vision as follows;” ‎there are two types of verbal communication, ‎דבר‎ used by a ‎master when he wishes to address his servants. Some masters use ‎a direct visual method of speaking to their servants; others ‎address their servants while being shielded behind a dividing ‎curtain. As a rule, the intimate friends or highly placed servants ‎of the master enjoy direct communication, whereas the lower ‎echelon of servants does not get to see the face of the master ‎while being addressed by him. The reason for this discrimination ‎is that the Master is an intelligent being and his method of ‎expressing himself is not understood well by servants that lack ‎education.‎<br>While Avram had attained a degree of intimacy with his ‎Creator that qualified him for being addressed by the Master ‎‎(Creator) in the manner prophets are normally addressed, he had ‎attained this status due to having served his Master from feelings ‎of love for Him. At the same time, he had not bonded with his ‎Creator through the use of additional virtues. Now that he had ‎defeated the 4 kings and their armies, using the characteristic of ‎גבורה‎, valour and courage in the process, and had thereby ‎avenged the manner in which these kings and their followers had ‎insulted G’d’s majesty, he had qualified for a level of ‎communication that, while not on the level of Moses, was still ‎superior to the manner in which G’d addresses most prophets. ‎This is why the Torah introduced this paragraph with the words: ‎אחר הדברים האלה‎, “after the preceding events.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 12_Paragraph": "The second method of serving the Creator, i.e. the motivation ‎being love for the Lord, does so because he feels himself as totally ‎unworthy, possessing no so-called self-respect, but is part of the ‎אין‎, metaphysical aspects of the universe. We must remember ‎that among the people serving G’d out of love for Him, some may ‎be motivated by the awareness that serving the Lord earns a ‎reward, so that this may consciously or subconsciously affect the ‎purity of his service of the Lord. Anyone who serves the Lord in ‎this fashion belongs to the category of people serving Him out of ‎the ‎יש‎ dimension of the universe. Only he who serves the Lord ‎exclusively by trying to provide the Lord with a sense of ‎satisfaction, pleasure from His creatures, belongs to the category ‎of people serving Him from the dimension of ‎אין‎ a domain totally ‎devoid of anything remotely physical. When the Torah wrote of ‎Avram that ‎ויסע אברם הלוך ונסוע הנגבה‎, it testifies to the spiritual ‎accomplishment of Avram who had ascended to the level of ‎serving G’d from love, i.e. by totally negating himself as an ‎individual. The term ‎הנגבה‎ is used to describe something dried ‎out, i.e. no longer possessed of physical urges, not even serving ‎the Lord for the promise of a reward.‎<br>Another angle from which our verse may be viewed zeroes in ‎on the repetition of the words denoting traveling, journeying, i.e. ‎הלוך ונסוע‎. Why did the Torah have to write two verbs to describe ‎this journey? The basis of this exegesis is the <i>Zohar</i> III 263, ‎according to which Avraham served G’d out of feelings of love, ‎and that the meaning of the word ‎הנגבה‎ is exchangeable with ‎דרומה‎, an allusion to ‎חסד‎, love (as in ‎זכרתי לך חסד נעוריך‎, “I ‎gratefully remember the love of your youth as a bride” Jeremiah ‎‎2,1)‎<br>It is known that the <i>Zohar</i> (5 separate occasions) has ‎repeatedly stated that what occurs in our terrestrial world evokes ‎its counterpart in the celestial regions. If this is so, it is clear that ‎by serving the Lord out of love, Avraham evoked a reciprocal ‎sentiment on the part of G’d, Who poured out His love for the ‎creatures on earth. Accordingly, our verse describes the journey ‎described as progressive, i.e. the repetition of ‎הלוך ונסוע‎, ‎emphasizes how Avraham moved closer and closer in the ‎direction of the ideal ‎חסד‎, i.e. ‎הנגבה‎. The first of these two words, ‎הלוך‎, logically, describes the direction in which Avraham’s ‎spiritual journey took him, whereas the second word ‎ונסוע‎ ‎describes the reciprocal journey made toward him by the Lord.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 29_Paragraph": "Going back once more to Genesis 15,8 when Avraham himself ‎had asked a question not i.e. revealing that He had not quite ‎understood G’d, as a result of which he was granted better ‎understanding, just as Avimelech here had concluded with ‎understanding and acknowledging the dimension of G’d as ‎אנכי‎, ‎the Talmud <i>B’rachot</i> 7 states that when Avraham posed the ‎question of ‎במה אדע‎, he had become the first person ever to ‎address G’d as ‎א-דני‎, “My Lord;” He had implied by this that G’d in ‎His capacity of ‎א-דני‎ was able to annul decrees. Noach had not ‎been aware that G’d could do this, and this is why he had not ‎bothered to appeal to G’d to annul the decree to annihilate ‎mankind. His predecessor Sheth, third son of Adam, himself a ‎‎<i>tzaddik</i> had also not known about this and therefore he had ‎remained silent when a third of the inhabited area of the globe ‎had been flooded in his day. The power of addressing this ‎dimension of G’d was given to Avraham as a reward for having ‎recognized G’d as possessing this dimension. It was Avraham’s ‎genius to recognize this quality of G’d although he addressed Him ‎as “My Lord.”‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 3_Paragraph": "Still another facet of the line:‎אלה תולדות נח, נח איש צדיק, תמים ‏היה בדורותיו‎, may be appreciated by the reader after we have ‎‎“digested” <i>Rashi’s</i> commentary on Genesis 7,7 ‎ויבא נח.....  אל ‏התבה מפני מי המבול‎, “Noach (and family) entered the ark on ‎account of the waters of the deluge.” <i>Rashi</i> uses this verse ‎to state that Noach was deficient in his faith in G’d. <small>[<i>Rashi</i> based ‎himself on <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 32,6 who explains the extraneous ‎words: “on account of the waters of the deluge,” as telling us that ‎Noach did not enter the ark until the rising waters of the flood ‎made this unavoidable.”]</small> This exegesis appears to fly in the face ‎of an explicit verse in Genesis 6,22 according to which Noach ‎carried out every single one of G’d’s instructions without ‎exception. How could the author of the Midrash accuse Noach of ‎being lacking in faith? If someone spent 120 years building an ‎ark, anticipating a deluge, because G’d had told him to do so, how ‎can this be interpreted as “lack of faith?”‎We must bear in mind that all the holy “sparks” are possessed ‎of an urge to serve their Creator, just as do the different ‎categories of angels all of whom vie to fulfill the wishes of their ‎Creator while being in awe of Him. The <i>tzaddik</i>, being a ‎mortal human being and burdened with an evil urge within him, ‎may not always serve his master with a similar degree of single-‎mindedness. He may be sidetracked by thinking of money, or the ‎allure of secular attractions, including good-tasting fruit, etc. One ‎of the causes distracting the <i>tzaddik</i> from serving his ‎Creator with the same degree of single-mindedness as the angels ‎is that in order to bring the sinners closer to G’d, he must first ‎befriend them. The sinners are sinners because the have within ‎them some of the 288 sparks that “fell off” the <i>Shechinah</i>, ‎as we explained on page 21.<br>‎<small>[A ‎רשע‎, sinner, who too has been created in the image of G’d, ‎contains within him some of these sparks, though they have ‎become tainted through their close association with the sinner. ‎Ed.]‎‎</small><br>In the process of “outreaching,” as it is commonly known in ‎our time, the exposure of the highest ranking type of ‎‎<i>tzaddik</i> to the lure of secularism is such that he may ‎momentarily forget his true calling, feeling drawn to these ‎‎“perks” of <i>olam hazeh</i>, as advertised by Satan in eye-‎catching colors. A <i>tzaddik</i> engaged in such activities may be ‎viewed as being engaged in a ‎מלחמת מצוה‎, “a holy war,” on behalf ‎of his Creator.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 18_Paragraph": "It is known in kabbalistic circles that a righteous person, a ‎צדיק‎, is also referred to as ‎בן‎, “son.” When the Jewish people ‎conduct themselves in the manner desired by G’d, the Torah ‎quotes G’d as referring to them as ‎בנים‎, “sons, children.” ‎‎(Deuteronomy 14,1) What distinguishes a righteous person from ‎normal people is that he does not suffer from an insatiable ‎appetite for the comforts and allures that this world has to offer, ‎but is content with what he has been granted by his Creator. This ‎is another way of describing him as possessing ‎כל‎, everything. He ‎does not feel that he lacks anything. This is especially true of the ‎type of righteous people who spend their days asking G’d to ‎dispense His largesse to others whom they perceive to be in need. ‎Their concern for others instead of their asking G’d for more for ‎themselves, stamps them as having been blessed ‎בכל‎, “with ‎everything.” Moreover, it is to be assumed that people who ‎concern themselves with the needs of their peers all the time, are ‎clearly content that G’d has already given them all that they ‎require for themselves. <br>It is appropriate for every good Jew to emulate Avraham’s ‎example in this respect, and this is why the same expression, i.e. ‎מכל‎ in the case of Yitzchok (Genesis 27,33), and ‎כל‎ in the case of ‎Yaakov, (Genesis 33,11) has been used by the Torah to document ‎that if Avraham was the “father” of this attitude, his children, i.e. ‎descendants, have emulated him, so that the term ‎בת‎ as we ‎explained several times, is a reference to the container from ‎which the largesse of G’d is dispensed. What the sages meant ‎when they said that G’d had blessed Avraham with a ‎בת‎, is that ‎his descendants had cultivated this virtue of his, of being ‎concerned first and foremost with the needs of others. In psalms ‎‎21,3 David expresses his gratitude to G’d Who has granted him all ‎of his aspirations. He too had emulated this virtue that his ‎people’s founding father had been able to implant in his ‎offspring.‎‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 37_Paragraph": "An alternate approach to the line: ‎במה אדע כי אירשנה‎. There is ‎no question that Avram did not request a sign from G’d as proof ‎that his as yet unborn descendants would inherit the land of ‎Canaan.<br>The idea that his claim to the land of Canaan could be ‎remotely due to his having Terach as a father never even ‎occurred to him. If we needed proof of that, we need only recall ‎the Talmud <i>B’rachot</i> 16, according to which the Jewish ‎people have only three patriarchs and 4 matriarchs. The title ‎‎“patriarch” implies that one is the “root” of the son whom one ‎has sired by means of transmitting seed from the brain, the seat ‎of one’s intelligence, which transmits it to the semen. It follows ‎that the thoughts that preoccupy the father at the time when he ‎engages in marital relations are transmitted through his semen to ‎the ovum upon merging with it. If the father-to-be thinks holy ‎thoughts at the appropriate time, some of these will be ‎transferred to his seed, etc. There can be little doubt that ‎Avraham was not the product of a father who entertained such ‎godly thoughts when he helped conceive him. How could he ‎therefore be considered a patriarch of the Jewish people? Terach ‎was wholly consumed by thoughts and desires centered around ‎the physical part of his existence on earth. If his offspring was of ‎a diametrically opposite orientation this could not have been ‎attributed to his biological father at all. It must have been due to ‎G’d’s desire that with the development of the fetus resulting in ‎Avram, G’d intended to lay the foundation of a Jewish nation. We ‎can think of it in terms of G’d providing some additional spiritual ‎light to His universe at the time of Avram’s birth. He was ‎destined to become a new type of “tree of life,” albeit outside the ‎boundaries of <i>Gan</i> Eden. According to <i>Ari’zal</i>, Terach ‎and his wife became the “go-between” before this light could be ‎made available in the terrestrial domain of the universe in order ‎to assuage the feelings of Satan, who would otherwise have ‎accused G’d of having favoured the creatures in the “lower” part ‎of the universe. The fact that Terach, i.e. what he represented as ‎a merchant of idols, sired Avraham according to the norms ‎prevailing in our part of the “lower” universe, deprived Satan of ‎the opportunity of accusing G’d of such favoritism of the human ‎race versus other loftier regions and their inhabitants. <small>[I have not ‎seen the words of the <i>Ari’zal</i>, but I trust that I have ‎understood them correctly. Ed.]</small> The essential thing to remember ‎is that the actual birth of Avram was a result through ‎intervention by Divinely inspired intelligence.<br>Terach does not ‎feature at all in the ‎אב‎ part of Avram’s name; no part of his ‎intellect provided the characteristic in Avram’s personality that ‎enabled him to develop as he did.<br><small>[It is important to ‎remember, especially for people who have little background in ‎kabbalah, that the idea of G’d predetermining a person’s lifestyle ‎and his abilities has been spelled out in the Bible when G’d told ‎Jeremiah that He had destined him to be the prophet during the ‎period when the Temple was in danger of being destroyed. G’d ‎was nearing the end of His patience with the Jewish state of that ‎period even before he had been conceived. (Jeremiah 1,4) Ed.]</small> In ‎spite of all the reasons for disqualifying Terach from being given ‎any credit as the indirect founder of the Jewish people, the fact ‎that Avram had spent 9 months inside the womb of his mother ‎after she had been impregnated with his semen, Avram was ‎required to undergo 10 “tests,” in order to cleanse himself ritually ‎from the spiritual contamination he experienced in his mother’s ‎womb.<br><i>Rashi</i> <small>[not found there, Ed.]</small> writes about this ‎aspect of the ten trials Avraham had to undergo in his ‎commentary on Exodus 6,8 ‎נתתי אותה לכם מורשה אני ה'‏‎, “I have ‎given it to you as an inheritance, I am the Lord.” <small>[The ‎contradiction in this verse is obvious; since when is an ‎inheritance “given?” it is transmitted from father to son upon ‎the father’s death! Ed.]</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 18_Paragraph": "Genesis 27,30 <b>“it was that as soon as Yitzchok had ‎concluded blessing Yaakov, etc.;”</b> we need to understand ‎why Yitzchok had not wanted to bestow a blessing on Yaakov, ‎originally. Nachmanides writes: (not found in Torah commentary) ‎that Yitzchok preferred Yaakov to remain unaware of the ‎blessings bestowed upon him. <small>[Perhaps he felt that way ‎seeing that his own father, Avraham, also had not bestowed a ‎blessing upon him, and left it for G’d to do so after he had died. ‎Compare. Genesis 28,4 where Yitzchok makes it plain to Yaakov ‎that he had not received this blessing from his own father. ‎Ed.]</small> This seems difficult to understand. Perhaps we may ‎understand it better in conjunction with what the Talmud ‎‎<i>B’rachot</i> 45 states that the person translating the public ‎Torah reading must not raise his voice to be louder than the voice ‎of the person reading the Torah from the original scroll. The ‎reader represents G’d, Who has given us the Torah, whereas the ‎translator only represents the reader. The Talmud cites Exodus ‎‎19,19 as the source for this ruling. Anyone reading that verse will ‎be astounded, as it sounds as if G‘d, responding to Moses spoke ‎louder than Moses, when repeating what Moses had told Him. ‎‎(Compare <i>Tossaphot</i> on that folio) However, the point is, as ‎we learned in <i>B’rachot</i> 12, that any benediction that does ‎not contain a reference to G’d as King, is not considered a ‎benediction in the full meaning of the word. Similarly, any ‎benediction which follows immediately after another benediction ‎also does not rank as a (separate) benediction in the full sense of ‎the word so that it does not need to include another reference to ‎G’d as “King”.‎<br>It appears that Avraham had a “claim” on the word ‎א-ל‎ as a ‎name of G’d, as G’d uses this name when bestowing acts of loving ‎kindness on His creatures. Yitzchok, on the other hand, had a ‎similar claim on the word ‎אלוקים‎ for G’d, as this name represents ‎Justice or judgment. This is why his son Yaakov in Genesis 31,42 ‎speaks of ‎פחד יצחק‎ “He Who Yitzchok was in awe of and Who ‎assisted me,” when describing Yitzchoks’ G’d.” Yaakov, had a ‎‎“claim” on the tetragram, i.e. ‎י-ה-ו-ה‎, the name of G’d representing ‎primarily the attribute of Mercy. In order for the attribute of ‎Justice to be “sweetened” somewhat, it needs to be applied in ‎conjunction with the other two attributes we mentioned.‎<br>The <i>Ari z’al</i> said that the word ‎אתה‎ when used in the ‎beginning of each benediction is an allusion to the attribute ‎א-ל‎, ‎so that when one commences the benediction with the words ‎ברוך ‏אתה י-ה-ו-ה‎, the word ‎ברוך‎ signifying continuation, or conduit, ‎meaning that G’d continuously dispensing loving kindness by ‎means of both His names ‎אתה א-ל י-ה-ו-ה‎. Through His continuing ‎to do so, G’d automatically “sweetens,” i.e. softens the impact of ‎the attribute of Justice, the one referred to as ‎אלוקינו‎ in every ‎benediction we pronounce. It follows that when one benediction ‎follows on the heels of another benediction, there having been no ‎prayer or psalm interrupting the two, that there is no need to ‎acknowledge G’d once more as being King, as the full impact of ‎the attribute of Justice has already been softened so that we do ‎not need to appeal to G’d as a benevolent ruler, i.e. King, to soften ‎the attribute of Justice once more.

Our author, following a ‎kabbalistic approach demonstrated ever since his approach to ‎Genesis 3,1 (page 22) where he referred to certain sparks that fell ‎off the <i>Shechinah</i> and landed somewhere in our world, has ‎considered it the task and intense desire of the <i>tzaddik</i> to ‎snare (hunt and capture) some of these 88 sparks of the Divine ‎and make them his own in order to restore them to their origin. ‎Accordingly, Yitzchok views Esau as in pursuit of this valuable ‎‎“game,” hoping that his son Esau, the hunter, could help him in ‎his quest. Although he was aware that Esau’s “hunting” was ‎concerned with physical bounty, he hoped to sublimate his skills ‎to pursuing something more spiritual by teaching him Torah, ‎thus elevating him spiritually. After all, according to our ‎tradition, the souls of famous converts to Judaism such as ‎Shemayah and Avtalyon as well as the great scholar Rabbi Meir, ‎are all reported to be descendants of Esau’s soul.

Initially, Rabbi Yitzchok thought that the message ‎about how G’d relates to His universe and the human beings He created, could have been ‎conveyed just as well by commencing with chapter 12 in Exodus.

        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 25_Paragraph": "In the dialogue just described by the Torah, the first difficulty is the meaning of the word ‎אף‎ with ‎which the serpent commences. Normally, we understand this word to mean: “although, in spite ‎of,” or something to that effect. Why would the serpent begin the conversation by using this as an ‎introductory word? Furthermore, why did the serpent “quote” G’d as having said ‎פן תמותון‎, “lest ‎you will die,” when in fact G’d had said <small>[concerning a single tree Ed.]</small> ‎כי ביום אכלך ממנו תמות‎ “for ‎on the day you eat from it you will die.”(Genesis 2,17) G’d had made an absolute statement “you ‎will die,” whereas the serpent changed the statement to a warning rather than a threat, i.e. “lest ‎you may die,” describing death as a possible rather than as a definite result of eating from the tree.‎'<br><br>Prior to the sin, both Adam and Chavah did not appreciate the concepts of ascent and descent of ‎‎“sparks” of the <i>Shechinah</i>, so that when they heard G’d mention the word “death,” they ‎had understood it as a merely temporary condition, such as unconsciousness. They had not ‎understood it as referring to the “death” of worlds, and that is why the serpent’s argument made ‎sense to them, as they felt that the Creator would be contradicting all that He had created if He ‎were to allow it to disintegrate so easily by a relatively insignificant action such as eating from the ‎fruit of the tree. ‎<br>When our sages in <i>Chagigah</i> 14 relate that four people “descended” into the <i>pardess, ‎‎</i>(acronym for<i> “peshat, drush, remez, sod</i>) the four disciplines used to explore the ‎depths of the Torah, and that only Rabbi Akiva, returned unscathed, they meant to warn us not to ‎embark on such excursions as they might result in our death. Adam and Chavah entertained ‎doubts about the exact meaning of the result of disobeying G’d’s prohibition and its consequences ‎for anyone disregarding this command. These doubts made them potential victims of the serpent, ‎who phrased the ”threat” in such a manner that Chavah thought there was logic to the serpent’s ‎words, especially when by repeating: ‎לא מות תמותון‎, the serpent claimed that no manner of ‎‎“death” would result from her eating from the fruit of the tree. The serpent implied that creatures ‎who are ranking as high in G’d’s hierarchy as Chavah and her husband, did not have any reason to ‎fear “death.” The serpent implied that the unscreened “light” emanating from the ‎‎<i>Shechinah</i> was not beyond their ability to digest without harm, on the contrary, they would ‎gain additional wisdom, and become able to tolerate even more intense rays of Divine “light.”‎",

At the beginning of the portion ‎where G’d had told Avram to leave Charan for his own good, He ‎had not promised him anything specific, such as children, or that ‎he and his children would inherit the land of Canaan, for instance, ‎even though G’d assured him of a great future in general terms, ‎i.e. “I will make you great and your name great.” He had basically ‎assured him only that he would not be losing anything by ‎undertaking this journey. By now, however, G’d had added ‎specific promises in addition. These promises concerned matters ‎that are of importance to people who feel rooted in the terrestrial ‎life on earth. In recognition of these promises Avram built an ‎altar, i.e. he reciprocated the good that G’d had done for him with ‎an act that would bring him closer to G’d. He did so to show G’d ‎that he did not view His promises as intended for himself as such, ‎but as a means of enabling him to continue to intensify the ‎manner in which he had been serving G’d.<br><small>[I feel constrained ‎to add at this point that according to all our traditional sources the ‎revelation discussed in chapter 15 of Genesis occurred 5 years ‎before Avram was commanded to leave Charan to a destination ‎G’d did not immediately reveal. This interpretation is based on the ‎fact that otherwise the verse in Exodus 12,40 that the Israelites had ‎dwelled in Egypt for 430 years is impossible to reconcile, as ‎traditionally, the 400 years of which G’d spoke in chapter 15,13 ‎began with the birth of Yitzchok.

The word ‎אליו‎, to him in 15,7 is not really ‎necessary, as there had been no interruption between this verse ‎and the one preceding it, so that it was necessary to insert this ‎word to prevent any misunderstanding about whom G’d was ‎addressing. The word ‎אליו‎ appears to hint that in this instance G’d ‎addressed Avram primarily in his capacity as a member of the ‎world of the ‎יש‎, the part of the universe in which it is possible to ‎sublimate the secular to a level of holiness, to elevate it to the ‎level of metaphysical dimensions.

Rivkah, while experiencing ‎even more than the normal amount of pain and discomfort ‎during her pregnancy, had concluded that this was proof that G’d ‎had not considered her righteous. Moreover, it is a tenet of our ‎faith that if someone is not a “good” person, such a person will ‎not serve as a receptacle for anything holy or potentially holy. ‎Our sages have based this insight on Leviticus 11,15 ‎את כל עורב ‏למינו‎, “and every subspecies of raven each according to its ‎species” (is forbidden to eat). <small>[The word ‎כל‎ in that verse means ‎that even close association with something ritually unclean, i.e. a ‎raven, is an obstacle to such a person hosting holy spirit, etc. Ed.]‎</small> According to <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 63,6 whenever Rivkah ‎passed a Torah academy Yaakov would make an effort to leave her ‎womb, whereas when she passed a pagan temple Esau would try ‎to leave her womb.

The <i>Midrash</i> states further that the ‎word ‎זה‎ in our verse refers to the fact that originally, -if not for ‎her complaint- Rivkah was slated to become the mother of all the ‎twelve tribes; seeing that she appeared to find fault with G’d’s ‎arrangement, she was told that she would become the mother of ‎only two sons, one of whom would be Esau. One of the sages in ‎the <i>Midrash</i> takes issue with the literal meaning of Yaakov ‎and Esau respectively having shown awareness of when their ‎mother passed a Torah academy or a pagan temple, and states ‎that, of course, this is merely a simile, and that Rivkah consulted ‎with the heads of the academy founded by Shem and ‎subsequently headed by his great grandson Ever. According to ‎another opinion offered, Rivkah knew that the source of holiness ‎is the One known as ‎אנכי‎, and when she exclaimed ‎למה זה אנכי‎, she ‎expressed her confusion how she could be the receptacle of a son ‎who clearly strived for holiness if she was not worthy. On the ‎other hand, if she were worthy, why did she experience such a ‎difficult pregnancy?

He is not so much concerned with ‎Avraham “ordering” his descendants to keep these ‎commandments, as no one knows better than G’d that such ‎‎“commandments” by a grandfather or great-grandfather, are ‎usually observed in the breach, seeing that even HIS direct ‎commandments are more often ignored than observed. The word ‎יצווה‎ in this verse is akin to ‎צוותא‎, ‎חברותא‎, friendly association, i.e. ‎performance of G’d’s commandments collectively in a spiritually ‎oriented community, each member of such a community drawing ‎inspiration and additional strength form the other.<br>The fact ‎that the words ‎ושמרו דרך ה' לעשות צדקה ומשפט‎, are phrased in ‎the past tense, i.e. “so that the generations following Avraham ‎drew on his shining example in the past when performing ‎righteousness and justice,” are G’d’s way of saying that when Jews ‎in the future will act as Jews, a large part of the credit goes to ‎their founding father Avraham. Avraham’s having had all of his ‎descendants in mind when he performed G’d’s commandments, ‎enabled them in later generations to emulate their ancestor. ‎Seeing one’s father perform charitable deeds, i.e. showing that ‎one considers oneself as merely an administrator of the wealth ‎granted by <i>Hashem</i>, makes it easier for the son to follow in ‎such footsteps.‎",

If someone desecrates the Sabbath, this will not be held against him ‎by most of his peers who feel that it is a matter between him and G’d.

G’d responded immediately, by saying:‎והנה דבר ה' ‏אליו לאמור וגו'‏‎, it is difficult to understand the word ‎לאמור‎, ‎‎“saying, or to say,” since to whom was Avram supposed to tell ‎what follows next?<br>We may better understand this ‎formulation by looking at Numbers 14,13-20 where Moses asks ‎G’d how by wiping out the Jewish people at that time, His name ‎would be exalted amongst the gentiles; on the contrary the ‎gentiles would interpret this as a sign of G’d’s inability to keep His ‎promise to His people. Upon listening to Moses’ argument at that ‎time, G’d relented and forgave the people in accordance with ‎Moses’ argument. On the last words, <i>Rashi</i> comments: “on ‎account of Moses having said due to G’d’s inability, etc.” It is ‎difficult to see in what way Rashi added anything to what Moses ‎had said, as reported by the Torah.<br>Upon reflection, Moses’ ‎comment to G’d about what the Egyptians would say if G’d were ‎to wipe out the Jewish nation is difficult. Did Moses really think ‎that omniscient G’d needed him to tell Him about this? It appears ‎from the fact that Moses bothered to mention this to G’d that the ‎words of a <i>tzaddik</i> do have an influence on G’d’s decisions. ‎This is confirmed in Job 22,28, ‎ותגזר אומר ויקם לך‎, “you will decree ‎and it will be fulfilled;” In the verses quoted from Numbers 14 we ‎find that G’d immediately responded to Moses’ argument by ‎changing the decree. Had G’d wanted to prevent the Egyptians to ‎make the kind of comments Moses had assumed they would make ‎if Israel would be destroyed, He could have brought this about. ‎The fact that He did not, and preferred to cancel His own decree, ‎bears witness to the effectiveness of Moses’ prayer. Moses’ prayer ‎prompted G’d to say: ‎סלחתי‎, “I have forgiven, etc.” It is this that ‎‎<i>Rashi</i> had in mind when he commented on our verse above ‎by saying. “on account of Moses having said, etc.”; <i>Rashi</i> ‎meant if Avram not mentioned the fact that he had no biological ‎heir to G’d, G’d would not have changed a heavenly decree that ‎had been in existence since before he had been born. In order for ‎the decree that Avram would not sire any children to be rescinded ‎or altered, he himself had to mention his grief about such a ‎decree in a prayer. Only then could G’d respond to this prayer. ‎G’d had to use provocative statements in order to get the ‎obedient and unquestioningly loyal Avram to be provoked into ‎making a comment that appeared to question G’d’s promise that ‎he would have children to be converted. The word ‎לאמור‎ in verse ‎‎1 is the Torah’s hint that G’d engaged Avram in the conversation ‎following in order for him in the course of this conversation to ‎reveal to Him that he experienced mental anguish at not having ‎children of his own. Once Avram had revealed this in an ‎unmistakable manner, G’d was able to take into consideration the ‎prayer of a <i>tzaddik</i> and to change the decree Avram had ‎read in the stars. Accordingly, Avram had to be induced to say ‎that Eliezer would be his heir.", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 9_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎12,8. <b>“Bet-El to the west and AI to the east;”</b> it is ‎understood by the Kabbalists that the <i>tzaddik</i> must always ‎remain attached to the <i>ayin</i>, ‎אין‎, i.e. to a negation of that ‎which is primarily physical, ‎יש‎ or known as “reality,” in our ‎parlance. He is able to ignore such “realities” due to his awe for ‎the Creator; the word: ‎והעי‎, is a variation of ‎עי השדה‎, “ruins in the ‎field;” (Micah 1,6). When the <i>tzaddik</i> is attached to this ‎אין‎, ‎he is able to draw down to our physical universe goodwill and ‎blessings from the celestial domain of the universe. Our verse ‎illustrates the concept of how a man of the caliber of Avraham is ‎able to be a source of good for the entire human race.<br><small>[The ‎author’s approach to our verse is again based (in my opinion) on ‎the implied question of why the Torah would bother to inform us ‎about such apparently irrelevant details about locations, details ‎which we read in public year after year for over 3700 years. ‎Compare author’s commentary on the measurements of Noah’s ‎ark. Ed.]</small> The moral/ethical message of the verse is that in order ‎to enjoy the benefits available in this terrestrial part of the ‎universe, one must first make certain that one maintains close ‎links with the celestial parts of the universe, which is the source ‎of these benefits. What was considered a ruin, ‎עי‎, before the <i>‎tzaddik</i> had established close ties with the celestial domain, turns ‎into ‎בית אל‎, a “house of G’d on earth,” after he has done so. The ‎Torah confirms this a few verses later after Avraham returns from ‎Egypt, when he is described as very rich in livestock, silver and ‎gold. (Genesis 13,2)‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 16_Paragraph": "Once Avraham was born, G’d did not again punish a nation ‎collectively unless the nation in question had deliberately harmed ‎the Jewish nation. Sins committed by the members of other ‎nations against G’d are stored up in His memory to be requited at ‎the time when the birth pangs of the messiah have begun. Prior ‎to Avraham’s birth, G’d’s attribute of Justice punished the ‎generation of Noach and the generation of the Tower collectively ‎for sins committed against Him.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 5_Toldot, 1_Paragraph": "Another way of looking at our verse is that of the ‎‎<i>Ari’zal</i>, who sees in the words ‎כי ביצחק‎ in Genesis 21,12 a ‎reference to the “feminine” side of Yitzchok in the diagram of the ‎‎10 emanations, i.e. the earthly element, seeing that the angel had ‎said to Avraham (Genesis 18,10) ‎והנה בן לשרה אשתך‎, “and here ‎your wife Sarah will have a son.” <small>[The angel emphasized Sarah as ‎predominant in Yitzchok’s birth, not his father Avraham. Ed.]</small> ‎However, subsequently he would receive a soul contributed by ‎Avraham, Avraham representing the masculine element of the ‎chart of the emanations. This point is made by the Torah here ‎repeating what otherwise would be assumed, that Avraham begot ‎Yitzchok. The <i>Ari’zal’s</i> comment also coincides with the ‎meaning of <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 58,5 in which the <i>Midrash</i>, ‎referring to Genesis 23,3 where Avraham is reported as “arriving” ‎in order to bury Sarah, asks: “where did Avraham arrive from? ‎Where had he been previously?” One of the answers given by the ‎Midrash is that Avraham came from Mount Moriah. The ‎‎<i>Midrash</i> adds that Sarah died as a result of the anguish she ‎experienced when told that Yitzchok had been slaughtered. She ‎had found this incompatible with G’d’s promise to Avraham that ‎ברך אברכך והרבה ארבה את זרעך‎, “I will continuously bless you and ‎greatly multiply your descendants” which G’d had said to ‎Avraham in Genesis 22,17.‎<br>At this point the author attributes to this <i>Midrash</i> a ‎third answer to the question whence Avraham came to arrange ‎Sarah’s funeral. I have not found this in any of my editions, ‎although this is the answer that would tie in with our verse ‎above. The <i>Midrash</i> supposedly views as Avraham “coming” ‎i.e. contributing the soul to Yitzchok as alluded to in the words ‎‎(Genesis 21,12) ‎כי ביצחק יקרא לך זרע‎.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 1_Paragraph": "An alternate approach to the words: ‎אל הארץ אשר אראך‎, “to ‎the land that I will show you.” It is a general rule in life that ‎when in doubt about a course of action that one should pursue, ‎one must rely on one’s G’d given power of reason. G’d indicated to ‎Avraham by giving him these vaguely worded instructions that ‎he was free to follow what his reason dictated to him.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 2_Paragraph": "Yet another possible meaning of these instructions: It is a ‎general rule that when a person flees from persecution in one ‎location that he turns to a place where he feels that he will be ‎more secure, even if it means that he will have to keep on moving ‎instead of establishing a permanent home. Since Avram had fled ‎from Nimrod as we know from <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 38,13, G’d’s ‎instructions to Avram to proceed to a land that He would show ‎him, was meant to reassure him that he would no longer have to ‎live the life of a fugitive as had been the case as long as he was in ‎Mesopotamia, a land under Nimrod’s rule. ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 2_Paragraph": "An alternate approach to the verse commencing with ‎אלה ‏תולדות נח‎. The word ‎תולדות‎ is a euphemism for the ‎pleasure/satisfaction afforded G’d by the righteous person who ‎observes His commandments. The Torah informs us that the true ‎pleasure the <i>tzaddik</i> enjoys from performing G’d’s ‎commandments is the certainty that he has contributed to His ‎Creator deriving satisfaction from his deeds.‎<br>", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Bereshit, 17_Paragraph": "As long as one has not attained the level of being a Torah scholar, the yearning for close affinity to ‎G’d is like a flash of lightning, something that disappears as quickly as it had materialized. While in ‎such a state, it cannot be recaptured at will. This is the meaning of the verse. Once one has ‎attained the level of being a Torah scholar, similar yearnings for close affinity to one’s Creator will ‎not disappear, but will be a constant companion to the Torah scholar. This was what Ezekiel 1,14 ‎had in mind when he compared the fleeting appearance of the ‎חיות הקודש‎, the highest category ‎of angels running to and fro, as fast as the momentary appearance of a bolt of lightning. Whereas ‎originally, man had to initiate this yearning for ‎דבקות‎, close affinity to G’d, having experienced it ‎once and continuing to recapture it by striving to make spiritual progress, G’d will reciprocate by ‎helping him to make this a more permanent relationship. In his allegorical commentary on the birth ‎of Peretz and Zerach, Nachmanides views the words ‎ויתן יד‎, as reflecting G’d’s helping hand. He ‎views the entire paragraph there as a conversation between G’d and man regarding this concept. ‎Although Nachmanides uses the conversation recorded as that between the moon and the sun ‎and G’d, in connection with who should have senior status (Chulin 60), our author views is as ‎between G’d and His subjects in that paragraph.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 4_Chayei Sara, 15_Paragraph": "Another way of understanding Eliezer’s refusal ‎to eat before he had acquainted his host with his mission, is that ‎the very meal would be converted into a ‎סעודת מצוה‎, a festive ‎meal of religious significance, once he had betrothed Rivkah. <small>[I ‎find this difficult, as Eliezer is described as eating and drinking in ‎verse 54 before Rivkah had been asked if she accepted the ‎proposal and was willing to go to Kiryat Arba. Ed.]‎</small>", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 27_Paragraph": "Let us examine the meaning of the word: ‎מחזה‎, “vision.” ‎When the prophets either saw or heard the words G’d wished ‎them to communicate to the people, they would become ‎completely detached from normal “reality;” this was due to the ‎overwhelming impact of hearing the word of the Creator. Once ‎they had cut themselves off from earthly concerns entirely, they ‎would be able to hear the instructions issued by the Creator. ‎When the prophet in turn would deliver these messages to the ‎people, they would again be in a state of suspended animation, ‎their ordinary faculties, including their minds, ceasing to ‎function. Having delivered the message that G’d had instructed ‎them to deliver, their normal faculties would again become ‎operative. The procedure we just described applied to all prophets ‎throughout the ages with the exception of Moses, who did not ‎need to go into a trance, abandoning his ordinary faculties, in ‎order to hear the word of G’d. G’d’s communications to Moses ‎took place while Moses’ faculties were fully operative, so that G’d ‎spoke to him as “man speaks to man.” Moreover, G’d’s ‎communications to other prophets were “dressed up” as a parable ‎of some kind, or they were shown an image of some kind ‎illustrating G’d’s message. G’d never needed to communicate with ‎Moses by having recourse to parables or visions in order to enable ‎him to understand what He was saying to him. Seeing that G’d’s ‎communications to all the prophets including Avram were not ‎perceived in the manner our intellect receives input from our ‎brain, G’d showed them images, or illustrated what He wanted ‎them to understand by means of a parable when He addressed ‎them. It follows that what the Torah describes Avram as having ‎experienced was not perceived in the manner that ordinary ‎perceptions are perceived by man. <small>[According to the author, the ‎brain acts as an interpreter of G’d’s words before the prophet ‎receives the message; when communicating with Moses, G’d did ‎not need to employ an interpreter for Moses to understand His ‎message. Ed.]</small> When the sages describe other prophets as having ‎to negate normal channels of communication in order to absorb ‎what G’d wanted them to hear and communicate to their peers, ‎this is what they meant. ‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 17_Paragraph": "Yet another approach to the above verse. In this verse the ‎Torah speaks of the performance of righteousness preceding the ‎performance of justice, i.e. ‎לעשות צדקה ומשפט‎, whereas ‎elsewhere we find the reverse order of ‎עושה משפט וצדקה‎. <small>‎‎[Actually, in connection with G’d we do not find that order ‎anywhere, we only find the sequence of ‎עושה חסד, משפט ‏וצדקה‎,“performing deeds of loving kindness, justice and ‎righteousness,” in that order. David, on the other hand is ‎described as :‎ויהי דוד עושה משפט וצדקה‎, “David used to mete out ‎justice and righteousness.” Ed.]</small> It is a rule that G’d always ‎dispenses His largesse to the Jewish people, this being His only ‎pleasure. The fact that the Jewish people are the recipients of His ‎goodness gives Him satisfaction. Our sages in <i>Pessachim</i> 112 ‎phrased it thus: “the mother cow is more desirous of suckling her ‎calf than the calf is anxious to drink her milk.” <small>[I am omitting the ‎balance of this paragraph, as I have not understood it. Ed.]</small>‎<br>We know that Yitzchok personified the characteristic/virtue ‎of ‎גבורה‎, steadfast bravery in face of overwhelming odds. We also ‎know that G’d in His love for the Jewish people, arranged for the ‎‎“cure” before the onset of the disease. (<i>Megillah</i> 13) ‎‎(Compare <i>Rashi</i> who describes the period of the Jews’ exile ‎and bondage as having commenced with the birth of Yitzchok. ‎Exodus 12,40) The Torah’s describing the birth of Moav and ‎Ammon, even before the birth of Yitzchok, is another example of ‎the redemption being prepared by G’d even before the onset of ‎exile, seeing that the messiah will be a descendant of Moav, Ruth ‎in David’s maternal ancestry.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Vayera, 19_Paragraph": "Genesis ‎21,1. <b>“<i>Hashem</i> took note of Sarah as He had ‎promised, and He did for Sarah as He had said.”</b> <i>Bereshit ‎Rabbah</i> 53,4 understands this verse as reflecting the truth of ‎what the psalmist said in psalms 119,89 ‎לעולם ה', דברך נצב בשמים‎, ‎‎“The Lord exists forever; Your word stands firm in heaven.” The ‎author of the <i>Midrash</i> queries, rhetorically, if David meant ‎that G’d’s word does not stand firm on earth? He explains that ‎what the psalmist had in mind was that the promise G’d made to ‎Avraham He had made in heaven, i.e. when the angel announced ‎that Yitzchok’s birth would occur at a time prearranged in ‎heaven. (In Genesis 15,5, long before the angel announced ‎Yitzchok’s impending birth, G’d had take Avram outside his tent ‎and had make him look at the heaven telling him that he would ‎father children and that the would be as numerous as the stars in ‎the heaven.) For our sages in <i>B’rachot</i> 7 the verse is ‎understood to make the point that even when G’d makes a ‎conditional promise, He will keep it. The Talmud there uses as its ‎proof Deuteronomy 9,14 where G’d had suggested that He would ‎trade the Jewish people who had made the golden calf for a new ‎Jewish people founded by Moses.‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 2_Lech Lecha, 6_Paragraph": "‎Genesis 12,2. <b>“and be a blessing!”</b> The letter ‎י-ה‎ in the word ‎והיה‎ is ‎an allusion to G’d, whereas he letters ‎ה-ו‎ are an allusion to the ‎Jewish people. As long as Avraham had not existed, there had not ‎been a human being who tried to “awaken” G’d’s largesse to be ‎dispensed in the lower regions of the universe. G’d’s largesse, ‎when it was dispensed for the good of mankind, owed this ‎exclusively to the Creator’s goodwill. As soon as Avraham became ‎active on earth, there were deeds on earth that “awakened” G’d ‎to dispense His largesse as a result of acts performed by His ‎creatures. In other words, prior to Avraham, G’d’s name could be ‎spelled in the order of ‎י-ה-ו-ה‎, whereas this order had now been ‎reversed and His name could be spelled as ‎ו-ה-י-ה‎. This is what the ‎author of <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39,11 had in mind when he said ‎that the meaning of the word ‎והיה‎ is equivalent to the meaning of ‎the word ‎שמחה‎, joy, i.e. there had not been any joy on earth prior ‎to the appearance of Avraham on earth. The reversal of the ‎sequence of the letters ‎ו-ה‎ hints at this largesse having its origin ‎in the lower, rather than the celestial regions. <small>[I have not found a ‎reference to ‎שמחה‎ joy, in our versions of this Midrash. Ed.]</small>‎", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Noach, 0_Paragraph": "Genesis 6,9. <b>“these are the generations of Noach;\"</b> there are two types of righteous people, both of whom serve the Lord. The first category does so with enthusiasm and profound devotion, but does so as an individual only, not endeavouring to draw other people, admitted sinners, nearer to their Creator.<br>There is a second category of <i>tzaddik</i>, righteous person, who not only serves the Lord himself, but who also is instrumental in leading sinners back to their Creator. Avraham was a prime example of the latter type of <i>tzaddik</i>. He was busy converting pagans to monotheism.<br>According to Ari’zal, Noach was even punished for not ‎rebuking the pagans in his time; his punishment consisted of his ‎soul being reincarnated in the body of Moses in order to ‎accomplish then what it had failed to accomplish on its first ‎round inside a human body. Moses made up for the sin of ‎omission of Noach by constantly rebuking the Israelites for their ‎shortcomings. When our sages in <i>Kidddushin</i> 40 discussed the ‎difference between a ‎צדיק‎, “a righteous individual,” and a ‎צדיק טוב‎, ‎‎“a good righteous individual,” they said that the former is ‎righteous vis a vis G’d, whereas the latter is “righteous both vis a ‎vis G’d, and vis a vis his fellow man.” Being “good” to one’s peers ‎involves more than being helpful and charitable; it includes ‎admonishing one’s neighbour when one observes him violating ‎G’d’s commandments. According to <i>Sanhedrin</i> 99, teaching one’s ‎neighbour’s son Torah is one of the most important ways in ‎which to demonstrate one’s concern for him, so much so that a ‎student who has been taught Torah by someone other than his ‎biological father is deemed as having been sired by that teacher. ‎In introducing Avraham to us, the Torah underlines (Genesis ‎‎12:5) that when heading for the land of Israel from Charan, ‎Avraham and Sarah took with them ‎את הנפש אשר עשו בחרן‎, “the ‎souls they had acquired while in Charan”. (the converts to ‎monotheism)‎<br>When the Torah refers to Avraham, it never wrote the ‎line: ‎אלה תולדות אברהם‎, as opposed to Genesis 6,9-10 where ‎amongst the ‎תולדות‎ of Noach we are told about his three sons; ‎there is no mention or allusion to any converts that Noach had ‎attracted to monotheism other than his own flesh and blood. The ‎word ‎אלה‎, “these,” is almost always used as a limitation, i.e. “these ‎and none other.” In Noach’s case, he had failed to “acquire souls.”‎<br>When we reflect on this we will understand why the Torah ‎wrote ‎ונח מצא חן בעיני ה'‏‎, instead of ‎ונח היה לו חן בעיני ה'‏‎. The latter ‎formulation would mean that when Noach faced G’d he brought ‎with him much to commend him, i.e. his converts, whereas the ‎formulation the Torah uses implies that G’d had to go looking for ‎Noach; indeed he was a valuable find, a ‎צדיק תמים‎, a perfectly ‎righteous man, but not one that could not be overlooked such as ‎Avraham’s “Chassidim.”‎<br>When the Torah testifies that ‎את האלוקים התהלך נח‎, “Noach ‎walked with G’d,” this sounds as proof of Noach’s aloofness vis a ‎vis his fellow man <small>[at least during the 120 years prior to the ‎deluge when he was busy building his ark. Ed.]</small> He was in step ‎with G’d, but out of step with his peers. This is why the Torah ‎repeats once more (verse 10) that he sired three sons, although ‎the Torah had informed us of this already at the end of the last ‎chapter (Genesis 5:32).‎<br>Noach, though aware of the many sexual perversions ‎practiced by the people around him, and being steadfast in not ‎copying their behaviour, is attested to by the Torah describing ‎him as ‎תמים היה בדורותיו‎, “he was perfect in his time.” ‎Nonetheless, his loyalty to the Creator certainly did not endear ‎him to his peers, hence “he walked with G’d”, as there was no one ‎else “with whom to walk.” Sadly, only G’d appreciated his self-‎restraint, his righteousness.‎"
