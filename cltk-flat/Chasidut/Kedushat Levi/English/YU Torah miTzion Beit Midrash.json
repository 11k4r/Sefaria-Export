        "1_Genesis, 11_Vayigash, 1_Paragraph": "... It appears, in my humble opinion, that Yehudah intended thus: Yehudah wished to awaken Yosef's ‎mercy, so that his heart would understand and listen to his pleading, but he sensed that this would ‎only come, as our sages say, via 'Words that come from the heart, enter the heart.' This is what he ‎intended, when he drew near to speak.‎ However, this is effective only when one person speaks to another directly; then his friend accepts ‎the sweetness of his words, and truth is recognized. When there is a translator, speech does not ‎make such an impression; this is clear to all who understand. The obstruction here was, \"The ‎translator was between them,\" (ibid. 45:23) for he spoke via a translator.‎ Therefore, Yehudah requested of Yosef to speak personally, without the translator. However, in ‎truth, it is not respectful to speak to the king in one's own tongue, for perhaps the king would not ‎comprehend it. Thus Yehudah declared, \"Please, let your servant speak in my master's ears,\" so ‎that the words would go from mouth to ear without a translator, in Yehudah's own formulation, ‎despite the lack of respect in speaking thus.‎ Therefore, he said, \"Be not angry at your servant\" at this mode of address. \"There is no claim ‎against me [Yehudah], for it is clear to me that you know the seventy languages;\" for the early ‎kings knew the seventy languages. Thus he said, \"for you are like Pharaoh,\" meaning that you are a ‎king, like Pharaoh, and you know seventy languages, and certainly, you will know our language. ‎And so is seen in Sotah 36b, \"Gavriel came and taught [Yosef] 70 languages.\" Pharaoh did not know ‎the holy tongue, but he was degraded for this, for a king should know all tongues.‎"
