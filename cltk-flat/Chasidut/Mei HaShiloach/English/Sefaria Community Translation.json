Every place that chametz could not be brought does not need to be checked. And why did they speak of two rows of a wine cellar as a place in which chametz could be brought? Beit Shamai says, \"two rows across the whole area of the cellar.\" Beit Hillel says, \"the two outer rows, which are the uppermost.\"", 
        "0_Volume I, 1_Genesis, 11_Vayechi, 2_Paragraph": "This means that Yaakov made himself smaller in comparison to his forefathers Abraham and Isaac, and said that they had greater wisdom and understanding, until they widened the (underlying) will of G-d from their own abilities.  Even though G-d opened up a small opening (that enabled them to do so) they widened it with their wisdom in order to do the will of their creator, and understood things that G-d didn't explicitly reveal to them.  This is the meaning of the words \"HITHALCHU\" - they walked from their own power, but I (Jacob am different) because 'G-d is my shepherd until this day' -i.e. that in every detail of every thing that I do, I need G-d to enlighten me as to his will.  Even in this situation where I have seen G-d's will (of my own accord), I still need to see at this time what G-d wants of me.  In this light, Jacob is the greatest of the forefathers, because it is a higher level for G-d to constantly be leading him.  This was the prayer of David of blessed memory, when he prayed: \" G-d is my shepherd I shall not lack\", meaning that I should never lack the protection that G-d has over me, and that he should constantly shepherd me, and I should constantly recognise that G-d is my shepherd.  Because, G-d, in his goodness leads everything.  Even if man turns his head away and doesn't want to expect (something to occur) or to pray, and at a time when a person prays a complete prayer then he is answered, and he will see that G-d is the shepherd.  This is the meaning of the words \" I will not lack\" - that I will not turn my face away from him. ", 
        "0_Volume I, 9_Talmud, 2_Pesachim, 2_Daf, 2_Paragraph": "This is the point that the Mishna asks about when it asks why they spoke of the \"two rows in a wine cellar,\" because the wine cellar teaches us about a Talmid Chacham and for what he needs to  ", 
        "0_Volume I, 2_Exodus, 4_Yitro, 4_Paragraph": "The text does not say “Ani,” for if it had done so, it would have suggested that the Holy One Blessed Be He revealed all of His light to Israel, in its fullness, and that thereafter they would not have been able to go deeper in His words, for He had already revealed everything. Thus the kaf [separating ani from anochi – ed.] teaches that it was not in its fullness, but rather an image, a likeness, of the light that God will reveal in the future. And all that a man will grasp in going deeper in the words of Torah will show that, until this point, he was in darkness. Day and night suggest this reality. The day is when God opens the gates of wisdom to people. The night is so that the person will not think that he has grasped everything in its entirety. For all that he has grasped is like the nighttime, when compared to the daytime that will come afterwards. And so it always is. Thus everything is nighttime in comparison to the light that God will open up in the future. This is what is suggested by the conjunction of the verse “Do not make an idol (pesel).” The Zohar teaches that “this verse is taught on account of the [later verse], ‘Make for yourself (p’sol l’cha) [two tablets],’--therefore, do not make an idol, and do not make yourself a servant of another Torah.” The idea here is that the word pesel means something which is cut, delimited, finished and without anything missing. But this is only found in the Torah of Moses. In human thought, nothing can be finished and made completely whole. As the Midrash (Ruth Rabbah 3:2) tells: Caesar said to Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania, “I am also able to make a Torah like Moses.” And he decreed that no one light a fire for three days. But in those three days he saw smoke coming from a certain house. The Caesar was told that one of his ministers was ill, and he decided to allow [the minister to make the fire in his house]. Of course, in our holy Torah we have this same rule, that saving a life outweighs Shabbat. But the difference is that one who desecrates Shabbat to save a life does not transgress the holy Torah, because the commandment to do so is part of the Torah. Likewise, in every place in which we invoke “When it is time to do for God,” we have a hint of “abrogate your law” (Ps. 119:12). Thus the Torah contains within it all of its own future abrogations, and its light encompasses all contingencies and all circumstances that could possibly come to be. No man has the power to do this. This is how the Zohar interprets “Do not make a pesel” – this refers to the positive commandments. “Or image” – this refers to the negative commandments. For nothing is revealed to any person in its entirety. \n", 
        "0_Volume I, 4_Numbers, 0_Bamidbar, 0_Paragraph": "Ad-nai spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting on the first day of the second month, in the second year following the exodus from the land of Egypt,  saying: raise the head of the whole Israelite community. \"Raise\" is an expression of elevation - that is, through the counting every individual will feel heightened and supported, as we read (Hosea 2:1) 'and the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which will not be measured, and will not be counted.\" And this verse seems to contradict itself (see Bavli Yoma 22b) because the beginning says \"And the number of the children of Israel will be\" suggesting that it is possble to count them, and after that it says \"Which cannot be measured etc\". In fact, all of Israel is without number, and what is written \"the number will be\" is said over every single specific soul of Israel, that every single one will be counted, that is, something of consequence in the counting, and important in the eyes of the Holy One of Blessing, as it is written \"Ad-nai will count in the register of peoples [that each was born there.]\" (Psalms 87:6) \"And to Zion it says: every person was born in her\" (Psalms 87:5) - this is that God does providence also with the other peoples, just not specifically on every single soul, but on all as a whole. \"And to Zion it says 'every person was born in her' - this means that the Holy One is interested in every single soul. And this is the explanation for \"and the number will be\" that every single person is needed, since through the community of Israel the greatnesses of the Holy One are made known, and if one is missing then the demeanor is missing. This is similar to when they draw the face of the king in thousands of tablets, and if one is missing - something of the face of the king is missing. And at the moment that one is counted in Israel he is the greatest of all Israel, since all Israel is a piece of the Holy One of Blessing, as it is written \"A piece of Ad-nai is His people\" (Deuteronomy 32:9) and every single one holds within oneself one of the aspects of the Holy One of Blessing, and at the moment s/he is counted then the Holy One was in that aspect that s/he is held by and therefore s/he is the greatest - and through this every single person of Israel is heightened/elevated.", 
        "0_Volume I, 9_Talmud, 2_Pesachim, 2_Daf, 1_Paragraph": "Here the topic of checking for chametz teaches that a person needs to refine and clean himself from all dirt and waste and remove any relation of these things from himself, therefore the Mishna says that a place which one enters requires checking, but a place which one does not entire does not require it. Thus if a person knows on his own that he clean from some particular thing, he does not need to check for that thing, as it said that a person has to know himself."
