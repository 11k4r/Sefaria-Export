To Shalem, the Shilmi family.</b> A resonance of this verse was told to me in the name of the holy rabbi the Maharza\"v (may the memory of the righteous and holy be a blessing), which was said in the name of his father the holy rabbi the Mahari\"m (may the memory of the righteous and holy be a blessing), that this pasuk refers to the urge [<i>yetzer</i>]. For when a person desires to follow the advice of their [evil] inclination in any matter, the \"family of the inclination\" -- many families, and many supports, does the inclination have to [persuade one] to follow it. \"To Shalem\", that when a person wishes to walk in wholeness [<i>shleimut</i>]of service, the family of wholeness... as stated above. And it completes it, this is its language, and it says this also \"To Tachan, the Tachani family\" (Numbers 26:35) -- when a person wishes to pray and plead [<i>lehitchanein</i>], then it is the Tachani family, as stated above."
