        "9_Chanuka, 0_Paragraph": "The sages of the Gemara designated the days of Hanukkah as yamim tovim, or good days, to be celebrated with the recitation of Hallel and expressions of gratitude. Hashem called the light “good.” According to the Zohar, a \"yom tov\" (good day) is so called because it radiates the goodness that God has reserved for the World to Come. In response to the Hanukkah miracle, the sages established these days as yamim tovim for praising and giving thanks, so that the inner light within all Jews would shine forth. Each year, these days are designated as occasions for praising and giving thanks, and this is where the term \"Yehudim\" (Jews) originates. When Leah named her son Judah, she said, \"This time I will give thanks,\" which Rashi interprets as meaning \"since I have received more than my fair share [of children].\" We, the children of Israel, recognize that everything that God gives us is more than we deserve, as we are \"the least of all the peoples\" (Deuteronomy 7:7). The midrash explains that this means that when God bestows greatness upon us, we humble ourselves even further, recognizing that it is only through God's kindness that we are so blessed, hence the name \"Yehudim.\""
