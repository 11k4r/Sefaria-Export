        "40_Pinchas, 11_Paragraph": "And behold, the ese three characteristics, that are bashful, merciful, and performers of kindness - we find their opposites in thise who are divided from the community of Israel. For the attribute of kindness is nonexistent in all other nations, as it is written \"chesed to the nations is a sin\" (Mishlei 14:34). And the attribute of mercifulness is not in the Giv'onim, who are the Netinim, who did not have mercy on the sons of Sha'ul. And the attribute of bashfulness is not found in mamzerim, as it is written \"and a harlot's forehead\" (Yirmiyahu 3:3). And it also says, \"any arrogant priest is from these\" [servants who assimilated into the priesthood] (Kiddushin 70b)."
