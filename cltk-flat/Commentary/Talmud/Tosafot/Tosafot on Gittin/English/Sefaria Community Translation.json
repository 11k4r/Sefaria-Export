[This is like what] we say in Chapter 'Hasholeach' (above, page 47a) about one who sells themselves and their children to idol-worshippers, [and this is true] a fortiori here where there is a murderer. Alternatively, [he was allowed to redeem the baby for more than its worth] because [it possessed] great wisdom."
