        "17_Chapter, 10_Verse, 1_Comment": "אורח כנשים means the way of menstruation.  ", 
        "2_Chapter, 15_Verse, 3_Comment": "ואל אישך תשוקתך AND TO YOUR HUSBAND WILL BE YOUR DESIRE — for sexual relations. And, nonetheless, you will not have the temerity to proposition him with [your] mouth, but rather HE WILL RULE OVER YOU — everything will come from him and not from you.  ", 
        "17_Chapter, 7_Verse, 0_Comment": "ויקח חמאה וגו AND HE TOOK חמאה, ETC. — but he did not bring bread, on account of Sarah becoming mentstruant; as the 'way of women' returned to her that day, and the dough became impure (Bava Metzia 87a). ", 
        "33_Chapter, 1_Verse, 0_Comment": " וישכב אתה AND HE LAID WITH HER — in its way (vaginally).", 
        "24_Chapter, 25_Verse, 0_Comment": "ואחרי כן יצא אחיו וגו AND AFTERWARDS HIS BROTHER CAME OUT, ETC. — I have heard a homoletical midrash that expounds it according to its simple meaning: It was with justice that he was grabbing him to hold him back. Jacob was conceived from the first drop and Esau from the second. Go and learn from a tube with a narrow opening - put in it two stones, one after the other. The one that goes in first will come out last, and the one that goes in last will come out first. It comes out that Esau, who was conceived last, came out first, and Jacob, who was conceived first, came out last. And [so] Jacob came to hold him back, so that the first for birth would be the same as the first for conception; and he would open [his mother's] womb and take the first-born status with justice.  ", 
        "18_Chapter, 4_Verse, 0_Comment": "ונדעה אותם AND WE SHALL KNOW THEM — with homosexuality, as in \"who have not known a man\" (Bereishit Rabbah). ", 
        "48_Chapter, 24_Verse, 3_Comment": "שדים BREASTS (<i>SHADAYIM</i>) — \"He will surely be cast down\" (Exodus 19:13), we translate (in Onkelos) as  <i>eeshtedaah yishtedi</i>. Also <i>shadayim</i> here is [to be understood that way,] because the seed shoots out like an arrow. ", 
        "25_Chapter, 9_Verse, 1_Comment": "והבאת עלינו אשם AND YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT GUILT UPON US — If he had lain with her already, YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT GUILT UPON US.", 
        "33_Chapter, 1_Verse, 1_Comment": "ויענה AND HE AFFLICTED HER — not in its way (anally) (Bereishit Rabbah).", 
        "25_Chapter, 7_Verse, 0_Comment": " ", 
        "31_Chapter, 14_Verse, 0_Comment": "עזים מאתים ותישים עשרים TWO HUNDRED SHE GOATS AND TWENTY HE GOATS — Two hundred she goats have need of twenty he goats, and so too in the case of all the various species the males were in number according to the need of the females. In Genesis Rabbah 76:7 an inference is made from here as regards the minimum period imperative for the marital duty imposed by the Torah - [for] the men of leisure, every day; [for] the laborers, twice a week; [for] the donkey drivers, once a week; [for] the camel drivers, once in thirty days, [for] the sailors, once in six months. I am unable however to show exactly how this inference is arrived at. But it appears to me that we may learn from here at least that this period is not the same for every person, but that it depends upon the amount of labor imposed upon him by his occupation. As we have found here that ten she goats were given to each he goat, and so [too] to each ram; [as] since they are free from work, their way is to be frequently involved in sexual relations and to impregnate ten females - and once an animal becomes pregnant, it does not accept a male. And [concerning] the bulls that engage in work, it only gave four females to the male; and to the donkey who goes on long journeys, [it gave] two females to the male; and to the camels that go on [even] longer journeys, [it gave] one female to the male.

        "48_Chapter, 2_Verse, 2_Comment": "יתר שאת SUPERIORITY IN DIGNITY — Since you were the first-born it was proper that you should be superior to your brothers by being endowed with the priesthood. This term שאת “lifting up” alludes to the נשיאות כפים the raising of the hands when the priests pronounce the benediction (cf. Onkelos).", 
        "23_Chapter, 15_Verse, 0_Comment": "בתולה A VIRGIN — from the place of her hymen (Bereshit Rabbah).", 
        "18_Chapter, 35_Verse, 0_Comment": "ותהרין וגו AND THEY BECAME PREGNANT, ETC. — Even though a woman does not become pregnant from the first intercourse, these [women] mastered themselves and took out their hymens; and they became pregnant from the first intercourse.", 
        "8_Chapter, 21_Verse, 1_Comment": "וירא את ערות אביו AND HE SAW HIS FATHER'S NAKEDNESS — Some say that he castrated him and some say that he sodomized him (Sanhedrin 70a).", 
        "48_Chapter, 2_Verse, 3_Comment": "ויתר עז SUPERIORITY IN POWER — meaning in royal rank, as is meant by עז in (1 Samuel 2:10) “And he will give strength (עז) unto His king”. And what caused you to lose all these?", 
        "48_Chapter, 23_Verse, 2_Comment": "אבן ישראל Onkelos takes אבן as an abbreviation of אב ובן and therefore renders it by אבהן ובנין the fathers and children meaning Jacob and his sons. ", 
        "48_Chapter, 2_Verse, 0_Comment": "וראשית אוני THE BEGINNING OF MY VIGOR — That is the first drop [of semen], as he had not experienced a seminal emission from all of his days [until that time] (Genesis Rabbah 99:6).", 
        "25_Chapter, 7_Verse, 1_Comment": "וישקף אבימלך וגומר AND AVIMELEKH  OBSERVED, ET CETERA — He saw him having sexual relations.", 
        "17_Chapter, 10_Verse, 0_Comment": "חדל להיות means [that] it had ceased from her.", 
        "48_Chapter, 2_Verse, 1_Comment": "אוני means MY VIGOR, as (Hosea 12:9) “I have gained me (און) strength”; (Isaiah 40:26) “by the greatness of His (אונים) might”; (Isaiah 5:29) “and to him that hath no (אונים) might Ho increaseth strength”.", 
        "16_Chapter, 24_Verse, 0_Comment": "בהמולו את בשר ערלתו WHEN HE HAD THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN CIRCUMCISED — With Avraham, [the word], <i>et</i> is not stated [as it is here with Yishmael], because the only thing he was missing was the cutting of the flesh, as [his foreskin] was already flattened through sexual relations. But Yishmael - who was only a child - was required to cut his foreskin and open [and push back] the circumcision. Hence about him, <i>et</i> is stated. (Genesis Rabbah 47:8)", 
        "23_Chapter, 15_Verse, 1_Comment": "ואיש לא ידעה AND A MAN DID NOT KNOW HER — not in its way (meaning, anally). Because the daughters of the nations would guard the place of their hymens, but abandon themselves from another place. It testifies about this one that she was clean from all [of this]. ",
