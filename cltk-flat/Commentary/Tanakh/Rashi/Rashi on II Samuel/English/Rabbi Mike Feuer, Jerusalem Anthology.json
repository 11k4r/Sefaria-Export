Its inhabitants were of the descendants of Avimelech and they had two statues - one blind and the other lame. They were made to represent Yitzchak and Yaakov and in their mouths was the oath that Avraham had sworn to Avimelech, therefore they (Israel) did not drive them out. When they took Jerusalem they failed to take the stronghold, as it is stated: “And the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the people of Judah were unable…” (Yehoshua 15:63) and it was taught: R’ Yehoshua ben Levi said: They were able, but they were not permitted."
