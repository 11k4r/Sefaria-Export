        "3_Third Gate; Blessings on Commandments, 27_Paragraph": "The reason women are exempt from time-triggered positive commandments is that a woman is subjugated to her husband fo rthe fulfillment of his needs. If she were obligated to perform time-triggered commandments, it might happen that just when she is performing the commandment her husband will command her to do his bidding. If she were to fulfill the command of the Creator and ignores his [her husband's] command, woe to her from her husband! And if she were to fulfill his command and ignore that of the Creator, woe to her from her Maker! Therefore the creator exempted her from his commandments, so that she can be at peace with her husband.",
        "9_Pesach, 0_Month of Nissan, 4_Paragraph": "Before one looks [for chametz,bedikat chametzRL], one blesses, “Blessed are You ... who commanded  us  regarding destroying chametz” (Pesachim 7b). We do not bless before we nullify chametz; the act of nullification depends on the intentions in one’s heart and one is not required to utter any words and no deed is involved at all, and one does recite a blessing on any mitzvah which is devoid of action, as we wrote in the introduction to this book. We do not bless upon searching for chametz, because that is a rabbinic mitzva. ",
        "9_Pesach, 0_Month of Nissan, 5_Paragraph": "After the bedikah, one must say, “All chametz that is in my possession that I have not seen and I have not destroyed, and about which I do not know, shall be nullified and considered like dust.” One should not say, “that is in this house,” but “that is in my possession,” as one might possess chametz in a different location.",
        "9_Pesach, 0_Month of Nissan, 6_Paragraph": "You might ask: Why does one need to check for chametz in the corners and remove it from his  house, which is more than is required for other forbidden items, such as the forbidden fat of an animal and meat that was not ritually slaughtered? You might answer that people separate from forbidden fat and meat that was not ritually slaughtered throughout the year, so we do not worry lest one accidentally partake of them, but one normally eats chametz and so we must worry. However, the question still stands, as we do not require a nazir to remove wine from his possessions even though he only separates himself  from it during the time of  his  vow. Furthermore, even though we eat grain all year round, and the new grains are forbidden  to be eaten until the 16th of Nisan even in the Diaspora, we are not required to remove it from our houses! Rather, we may explain that we are stringent regarding chametz because the Torah itself warned us more regarding chametz than regarding other mitzvot, prohibiting us from seeing chametz or having it found in our possession. Therefore, our Sages were more stringent and required us to perform bedikah to ensure we do not have a stumbling block. You can see that this is true from the fact that non-chametz prohibited foods are forbidden [in a  mixture] as long as they can be tasted. This even applies to wine used for libations to an idol; though even a minimal quantity of such wine prohibits wine into which it is mixed, it only prohibits other substances into which it is mixed so long as it can be tasted. On the other hand, any minimal amount of Chametz, in mixtures with both similar and dissimilar substances, prohibits the entire entity",
        "9_Pesach, 5_Festival Prayers, 15_Paragraph": "The reason God commanded us to count the Omer is because each person was busy with their personal harvests, and everyone was separately spending time in their own granaries - and might have forgotten to join the rest of the nation in Jerusalem for the holiday. The commandment to count the Omer reminds everyone to go up to Jerusalem for the holiday."
