And anyone who completes his [weekly] Torah portion [study] with the congregation [is blessed with] lengthy days and years. And also, one who is engrossed in the study of Torah the entire day, and his Torah study is his profession, may not withdraw from reading the weekly Torah portion with the congregation. He must read the portion, the verses twice and the translation once. And if one is engrossed in Torah to the point that involves the recording of insights and rulings, he is permitted to read on Friday night, the verses twice and the translation once.

Rather, he should put forth his claims with truth and simplicity before an established Rabbi, asking him to rule whether or not he is obligated to return money to his fellow. And even if his fellow is not bringing him to court, he is still obligated to fulfill his obligation towards heaven by asking a Torah scholar who is an expert decision-maker, as it is written (Mishna Avot Ch.1) \"Make for yourself a Rabbi and avoid doubt\". And even if his fellow does not know of the theft that was taken from him, one still has to return what was stolen and appease him. [Yalkut Yosef Moadim pg. 78.

It is best if the Chazzan says Selichot wrapped in tzitzit, from what Chazal say in Rosh Hashanah, \"God passed over his face, Rabbi Yochanan said, had the verse not said thise it would not be possible to say this, it teaches that God wrapped himself as a shaliach tzibbur and showed Moshe the order of prayer and said to him, when Israel sin do according to this order and I will forgive them. Rabbi Yehuda said a covenant was made with the 13 attributes of mercy that they would never return empty handed, as it says \"Behold, I make a covenant\". Similarly in the army camps where it is not possible to say Selichot in the early hours they say Selichot before Shacharit or before Mincha or after midnight.",

All the more so when one is wrapped in tefillin it is prohibited to take ones mind of them and one has to guard oneself in holiness and purity. One who does not do so, and he sleeps during prayer with his tefillin, or sleeps during prayer and keriat shema his reward is lost. It is best when one prays fittingly when he says selichot upon arising in service of God, to guard the fundamentals and add on with piousness and not to debase the fundamentals and fulfill the extras.",

Rather they should get up when they can at times throughout Elul and then during the ten days of atonement to say Selichot with the community. This is the law for officers and employed workers who, if they get up for Selichot won't be able to do their work faithfully, they are permitted to not get up every day, rather periodically and during the ten days of atonement.

If a person finds himself in a synagogue where it is customary to say Selichot in the first half of the night it is not permitted to join with then but rather sit alone and remain silent, and not respond to their 13 attributes of mercy. And on the contrary it is best of annul this custom as it has no foundation. The time for midnight has should be calculated in such a way as to calculate the beginning of the hours between sunrise and sunset, half of that is midday, when the sun is in the middle of the sky, and add 12 hours to midday and that gives you midnight exactly.",

And everybody who is able to wake up in the middle of the night, he should do it and say \"Tikkun Hasot\". And also, if you remain awake until the middle of the night, try not to sleep until you say Tikkun Hasot, to join with the pain of the Shekhinah in exile. However, when you pray and learn Torah you should be happy. And in any case, if you cry during the prayer, you prayer is accepted more.",

On Yom Kippur God forgave Israel with joy and said to Moshe \"I have forgiven your word\", so therefore Yom Kippur was established as a day of forgiveness, penitence and atonement.

The Torah that they toil in protects the generation, when they're not learning calamity comes to the world. Additionally in the Gemara it says that scholars that toil in Torah during the night, the Torah considered it as if they're involved in the sacrificial services. They also said, in the Jerusalem Talmud someone who is working the Torah in modesty (at night where nobody can see him) he does not forget his learning quickly. And Maimonides wrote: Even though it's a mitzvah to learn night and day, a person learns most of his wisdom at night. Therefore, if someone wants to merit the crown of Torah, he should be careful every single night, not to waste is on sleeping, eating and idle chatter, rather it should be with Torah and words of wisdom.",
