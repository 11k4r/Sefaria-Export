        "7_Siman, 2_Seif Katan": "Even though we make the blessing \"to wrap,\" covering the body alone is wrapping, and this is essentially the act of wrapping. For traveller who put on the talis when it's folded and drape it around their necks on their shoulders, they do not fulfill their obligation to wear tzitzis this way. In the regard all agree this is not wrapping. ",

It is good to say immediately upon rising \"I am gratefully to you my eternal king who has returned my soul in kindness; great is your faith.\" It should be said with a pause after \"kindness\", and \"great of your faith\" without pause. And this is from as its written \"renewal of mornings\" etc..., that the Holy One Blessed be He upholds his faithfulness to returns the souls to its depositor in the morning. And there is no need to wash hands, even if they are filthy, because in this wording there is no remembrance of the name of ADNOOT or any other name. And anyhow, it is forbidden to learn Torah before washing hands, and also forbidden before the blessing of the Torah.",

Because at the time when [Israel] wished [to fast] and accepted upon themselves the obligation to fast on all four of these fasts, they did not accept upon themselves that [all four] would be as stringent a public fast as Tish'ah Be'Av, because the majority of the community would not be able to stand it.  So a pious person should be stringent on all of them as on Tish'ah Be'Av, but if one of them falls on the evening when [a man's wife is due to] immerse [after her period], he should fulfill his obligation [to have marital relations].  Likewise, a person should not be strict about wearing shoes in order not to be a laughingstock. Likewise, if the 10th of Tevet falls on Friday, a person should not be strict about not washing in hot water out of respect for Shabbat.",

For not only do they not listen, but they mix it up so that the adults also cannot listen, and the only reason they come is to beat Haman.  In this way the father does not fulfill the commandment of education at all.  In truth, from the perspective of the commandment of education, every father has to keep his young children near him, and to supervise them that they listen to the reading, and when the reader gets to mentioning the name of Haman the Aggagite, the child is permitted to hit as is his custom, but not that that should be the primary purpose of bringing the child to the study hall.",

But yom kippur isn't on the ninth, it's on the tenth of the month! Chazal teach that it's a mitzvah from the Torah to eat on erev Yom Kippur and ha-kadosh-baruch-hu wishes to bestow rewar for the feasting as if it were fasting.

This is only l'chatchila (preferably), after the fact [if it was not done standing] he has fulfilled his obligation according to all. Most of the Archronim agreed that preferably he should make the blessing before the wrapping, at the time that he's holding it in his hand and intends on wrapping it, that this is \"just as he's about to do it.\" He shouldn't make the bracha while this talis is still folded.",

It's not similar to Chanukah because (the reading of the) Megillah is similar to the reading of the torah and it's unacceptable because of respect of the congregation and therefore, they can't fulfill the obligation of a single person. The chachamim didn't distinguish in any order and they set forth. And also, she's not obligated in reading, only in listening. And she follows the reading but she's not obligated in the matter of a man, but she can fulfill her woman friend.",

There is a custom to stand trees in the synagogues and homes in remembrance that on Shavuot judgment takes place for the fruits of the tree.  The Gr\"a abolished this custom because now it is the ritual of the (non-Jewish) nations to put up trees on their holiday.", 
        "4_Siman, 0_Seif Katan": "Translation of the words - like the Rabbis say (Berakhot 47) that one should not \"throw\" a blessing from his mouth, rather he should concentrate when saying it and make the blessing calmly. And this is the language used in the Sefer HaChinuch siman (chapter) 46: When one washes his hands, makes a blessing on a fruit, or mitzvot that are comfortable in his mouth [which he regularly says], every individual should concentrate their heart toward their Creator, Who does wonderous kindness to him, and gave him fruits or bread to benefit from, and commanded him to do mitzvot. And he should not act like individuals who do things out of habit and let words leave their mouths without any consideration; for this causes G-d to become angry at his people. And he sent to us in the hand of Isaiah and said (Isaiah 29:13) \"Because this people have approached me; with their mouth and with their lips they honor Me, but their heart they draw far away from Me.\" And see further there how terrible the punishment for this is.",

And most of the decisors hold that one can fulfill their obligation in this way. And it is better than just saying it in your head. For saying it in your head is not the same as actually saying it. But this is not the case with hearing which is actually like saying. And the Olat Tamid wrote that this is specifically someone who understands the language and even if it is said in Hebrew, the listener still needs to understand. See ch. 193 sect. 1 and in Sha'arei Knesset HaGedolah he brings in the name of the Birkat Avraham that this is specifically an individual who fulfills the obligation of an individual. But the individual who fulfills the obligation of the masses or an individual who who fulfills the obligation of another two in the blessing after meals, even if they don't understand Hebrew, their obligation is fulfilled.",

If, however, the other would be embarrassed by learning the details of the transgression, then one should not mention specifics. Furthermore, one who requests forgiveness from a group is not exempted if one knows that a particular individual was specifically wronged.",

In any case, even someone who needs to eat should not feast on meat and wine, but [should eat] only what they need.  And likewise, children who understand [enough] to mourn: although we are not obliged to educate them [to fast] even at age twelve and even for a fast of a few hours, it is in any case appropriate to educate them to eat just enough to sustain their bodies, water and other simple food as they require, in order that they will mourn with the community.", 
        "493_Siman, 11_Seif Katan": "Dairy foods - See Magen Avraham and I also heard in the name of a Gadol who said a correct reason for this: that when Bnei Yisrael stood at Har Sinai and accepted the Torah and went to their homes they found nothing to eat except for dairy foods because for meat they would need much preparation to slaughter with a checked knife like Hashem commanded... Therefore they had to eat dairy foods and we do this as a commemoration.",

If one prematurely search on the day of the 13th by candlelight, he needs to go back and search on the night of the 14th as the Sages enacted. Nevertheless, he shouldn't make a blessing then at night on the search, because there are authorities who hold that after-the-fact one has fulfilled his obligation with the original search. However, if one checked on the night of the 13th by candlelight, as candlelight if very effective at night for searching, and he was very careful not to bring chametz [into the checked areas], he does not need to go back and check on the night of the 14th - most Later Authorities agree to this, but whoever wants to be stringent and reconduct a search should nevertheless not make a blessing.", 
        "0_Siman, 1_Seif Katan": "(2) THE DAWN - A secret in written in the Two Tablets of the Covenant, to connect the day and night with Torah and prayer, whether its morning or whether its evening. Immediately upon waking up from sleep if he doesn't plan to sleep more, he should wash his hands, even if he is does so while still lying down. All the more so, he shouldn't walk four cubits without having washed his hands. He must be very careful in this regard. And the holy Zohar emphasizes the great punishment for this, for leaving the spirit of impurity on himself. In any case, he should not God forbid violate any other prohibition in order to not have a gap before washing his hands; like for instance, to stop himself from urinating for this purpose, or to take water which his friend had prepared for himself, if its not obvious to him that he will immediately be able to give him other [water] in exchange. And there are those who fail in this. And if he sees that the water is far and he doesn't have someone to bring it close to him, it is the custom of some of the observant ones (ba'alei ha'nefesh) to walk little by little in increments shorter than four cubits. The Sha'arei Teshuvah write about this that its better if hes able to run and not allow the spirit of evil to linger on his hands. There are those who say in regards to this idea that the entire house is like his four cubits, but we shouldn't rely on this unless in a time of pressure. If when he arises at night he sees that he does not have enough water to wash his hands three times as it appropriate to rid the spirit of impurity, nevertheless he should not God forbid forgo his Torah study because of this until daylight, but rather he should wash his hands a little or clean his hands on whatever he has to wash, make a blessing, and learn, as per the law of the Talmud and Torah.

Overcome him and do not listen to him, and think to yourself: If I had needed to arise to appear before a king of flesh and blood, how carefully and zealously would I arise and awaken in order to prepare myself for this service?

However, if you're in the presence of other average folk who would learn from him, then on could say, that it would be better to do it in their presence, so that they should learn from him how do as he has done.

And our rabbis spoke highly of the importance of this mitzvah (in Shabbat 118)... And similarly in every location, one should delight in Shabbat according to the custom, with food and drink that is considered delight for them.

On all of these days, all Israel fasts because of the misfortunes that befell them on these days, in order to arouse their hearts to open up to the paths of repentance [teshuvah].  This [fasting] will be a recollection of our evil deeds and the deeds of our ancestors which were like our deeds now, such that they caused them--and us--these misfortunes, and in the recollection of these things we will return [nashuv] to become better [people], as it is written (Lev. 26:40), \"And they will confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their ancestors...\"  Therefore, each person is obliged to take to heart on these days to examine their deeds and to repent [lashuv] of them, because the fast [itself] is not the essential [thing], as it is written [in Jonah 3:10] about the people of Nineveh: \"And the Eternal saw their deeds, that they repented [turned back] from their evil path...\" The Sages, may their memories be a blessing, said that their sackcloth and their fasting were not mentioned--just their deeds.  Fasting is nothing but a preparation for repentance.  Therefore, those people who, as they are fasting, go on walks or [pursue] trivial matters grasp the issue of secondary importance, but loses track of the essence.

On on 9 Av, the great destruction occurred. The First Temple was destroyed on [that day], as was the Second; and on that very day it was decreed that our ancestors that were in the desert would not enter the land; and on that very day, [Romans] conquered a great town, called Beytar [during the Bar Kokhba revolt], which was home to thousands of Jews, all of whom fell into the hands of the idolaters and all of whom perished, which was a calamity as great as the destruction of the Temple; and on this very day, destined for calamity, the evil Turnusrufus plowed the Temple and its environs, thus fulfilling what was said: \"Zion will be plowed as a field\" (Jer. 26:18). And on the day of 3 Tishrei, Gedalia son of Ahikam was murdered.  He had been appointed to lead the remaining survivors after the the [first] destruction [and his death led to] the extinguishing of the remaining embers of Israel, because [in the wake of it] all were exiled and thousands were killed.
