        "6_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "22: It is a Mitzvat Aseh to count seven complete weeks from the day of the bringing of the ‘Omer, as it says: You shall count for yourselves, from the day after the Shabbat, seven weeks. It is a Mitzvah to count the days along with the weeks, as it says: You shall count fifty days; and we count from the beginning of the day, therefore, he should count at night, from the night of the 16th of Nissan.",
        "6_Chapter, 2_Halakhah": "23: If he forgot to count at night, he should count during the day. We count standing up; however, if he counted while seated, this is valid.",
        "6_Chapter, 3_Halakhah": "24: This Mitzvah is incumbent upon every Jew, in every place and at every time; women and slaves are exempt from it.",
        "6_Chapter, 4_Halakhah": "25: One must recite a B’rakhah every evening: Blessed…Who sanctified us with His Mitzvot and commanded us regarding Sefirat ha’Omer before he counts; if he counted without saying the B’rakhah, he has fulfilled it and he does not go back and say the Berakhah."
