        "8_Chapter, 3_Halacha": "So too, the meat of beast or bird cooked with the milk of beasts or cattle is biblically not prohibited from eating; hence, it is permissible to cook it and to derive a benefit from it. It is, however, prohibited from eating it on rabbinic grounds, so that the people may not reach out beyond what is permitted and transgress the biblical meat-milk prohibition by eating the meat of a clean animal with the milk of a clean animal, since the literal meaning of the verse is restricted to a kid in its mother's milk only. For this reason, the sages have prohibited all meat with milk.", 
        "0_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "1) It is a positive commandment to know the simanim (signs) that distinguish between domesticated and wild animals, birds and fish, and grasshoppers that are permitted to be eaten, and those that are forbidden for consumption, as it says, (Leviticus 20:25) \"And you shall distinguish between a kosher animal and a non-kosher animal, between a non-kosher fowl and a kosher fowl.\" And it says, (Leviticus 11:47) \"To distinguish between the kosher and the non-kosher, between a beast which may be eaten and one which may not be eaten.\" ", 
        "16_Chapter, 8_Halacha": "And there are other things that the Sages prohibited, even though they are not Biblically prohibited, the Sages decreed upon these in order to distance from the Gentiles such that Israel would not assimilate in them, and intermarry. And the prohibitions are: The prohibited to drink with them, even when we are not worried about libations; and they prohibited eating their bread or dishes that they cooked, even when we are not worried about their \"revulsions\" [i.e. the absorbed taste of non-kosher food in the dishes]. ", 
        "5_Chapter, 9_Halacha": "Meat cannot be rid of its blood unless it is thoroughly salted and rinsed. How should one proceed? First, he should rinse the meat, and then salt it thoroughly and leave it in the salt for the time it takes to walk a mile. He should then rinse it well again until the water is entirely clear, and immediately throw it into boiling water, but not lukewarm water, that it may become bleached without any blood coming out.", 
        "8_Chapter, 26_Halacha": "This applies only to the meat of cattle and livestock; but if one eats poultry after milk or cheese, he is not required to cleanse his mouth or wash his hands.", 
        "3_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "Anyone who eats an olive-size of the flesh of cattle, beasts, or birds that died a natural death should be lashed, as it is written: \"You must not eat anything that has died a natural death\" (Deuteronomy 14:21). Whatever has not been slaughtered properly is regarded as if it died a natural death.— —", 
        "5_Chapter, 7_Halacha": "If one cooked a liver without singeing it over the fire or without scalding it in vinegar or boiling water, the entire dish is forbidden: the liver and all that was cooked with it.— —", 
        "5_Chapter, 20_Halacha": "A bowl in which one has salted meat must never be used for hot food, even if the bowl is lined with lead, for the blood has already been absorbed in its potsherds.", 
        "2_Chapter, 11_Halacha": "The milk of a non-kosher animal will not coagulate and form into cheese like the milk of a kosher animal. If milk of a non-kosher animal were mixed with that of a kosher animal, when it coagulates into cheese, the non-kosher milk with its whey will flow out of the cheese.", 
        "5_Chapter, 6_Halacha": "If the liver is cut open and thrown into vinegar or boiling water so that it becomes bleached, it is then permitted to be cooked. All the Jewish people have already adopted the custom of singeing it over the fire before cooking it.— —", 
        "5_Chapter, 10_Halacha": "When meat is salted, it should be salted only in a perforated utensil, using only salt that is as heavy as coarse sand, since the salt that is as fine as flour becomes absorbed in the meat and fails to extract the blood. Also, one must shake off the salt before rinsing the meat.", 
        "3_Chapter, 7_Halacha": "From this you may conclude that the Torah has forbidden an animal that has died, a <i>nevelah</i>. It has also forbidden an animal on the verge of death because of its wounds, even though it has not died yet, and that is <i>terefah</i>. Just as you can make no distinction between the causes of death, whether the animal died a natural death or it fell down and died — — so you can make no distinction in the case of an animal on the verge of death, whether a beast tore and mauled it — — or whether someone shot an arrow at it and pierced its heart or lungs.— — Once the animal is dying at any rate, it is <i>terefah</i>, whether the cause is a human act or an act of God. If this is the case, why is the term <i>terefah</i> (torn) mentioned in the Torah? Scripture speaks of what happens regularly. If you will not interpret it in this manner, you will have to assume that it refers only to an animal \"torn … in the field,\" and if it was torn in a courtyard it should not be forbidden! Hence, you must infer that Scripture speaks only of what is likely to happen.", 
        "8_Chapter, 27_Halacha": "If one has eaten meat first, whether the meat of cattle or fowl, he should not partake of milk thereafter until a lapse of time is spent, equal to the interval between two meals, namely about six hours, because the fragments of meat between the teeth are not removed by cleansing.", 
        "8_Chapter, 2_Halacha": "Biblically, only the meat of a clean animal with the milk of a clean animal is forbidden, as it is written: \"You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.\" The term <i>kid</i> includes the offspring of ox, sheep or goat, unless the text explicitly states \"a kid from the flock of goats\" (Genesis 38:17). The phrase \"a kid in its mother's milk\" is used only because Scripture speaks of something that actually happens. But if one cooks the meat of a clean animal with the milk of an unclean animal, or the meat of an unclean animal with the milk of a clean animal, he is permitted to do so and derive a benefit from it as well; punishment is incurred for eating it, but not by reason of its being a meat-milk mixture.", 
        "10_Chapter, 6_Halacha": "A Ger Toshav -- He who has accepted the Seven Mitzvot of the sons of Noah, as we have explained -- it is prohibited to drink his wine, but it is permitted to derive benefit from it. And one may leave wine with him briefly, but not for a long time. And so too any Gentile who does not worship the stars and the constellations, such as the Ishmaelites, their wine may not be drunk, but one may derive benefit from it. And such instructed all the Geonim. But those who worship the stars and the constellations, one may not derive benefit from their wine.", 
        "16_Chapter, 11_Halacha": "Even though they [the Sages] prohibited Gentile bread, there are cases where we are lenient and we take bread from a Gentile baker where there is no Jewish baker, and in the field, for it is a time of pressing need. But bread made by ordinary folk, there is nobody who permits it; for the primary purpose of the decree is from intermarriage, and if he eats the bread of ordinary folk, he will end up eating with them.", 
        "7_Chapter, 10_Halacha": "Ten stores: nine sell kosher meat and one sell non-kosher meat, and one takes meat from one of them, but does not know which one the meat was taken from, this [meat] is forbidden, as every established place is like a half of a half [i.e. each established location is treated as its own majority]. But meat that is found thrown in the marketplace, you can follow the majority, as anything separated [is considered to be] separated from the majority. If the majority of sellers are non-Jews, it is forbidden; and if the majority of sellers are Jews, it is permitted.", 
        "3_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "The term <i>prohibited nevelah</i> is applicable only to the clean species that are fit for ritual slaughter, and permitted as food if slaughtered properly. Unclean species, on the other hand, where <i>sheḥitah</i> has no advantage, if anyone eats of their flesh he is to be lashed not because of eating <i>nevelah</i> and <i>terefah</i> but for eating the flesh of an unclean animal; and it is immaterial whether it has been slaughtered properly or it has died a natural death, or whether he has cut a piece of flesh from it when alive and eaten it.", 
        "8_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "It is biblically forbidden either to cook or to eat meat with milk.— — Anyone who cooks both together [as little as] the size of an olive is to be lashed, as it is written: \"You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk\" (Exodus 23:19; 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21). So too, anyone who eats of both the meat and the milk that have been cooked together, [even as little as] the size of an olive, is to be lashed, even if he has not done the cooking himself.", 
        "7_Chapter, 8_Halacha": "A butcher who has been believed to sell <i>kosher</i> meat must refund the money to the customers if it has been found out that he has been passing on <i>nevelah</i> or <i>terefah</i> meat. He should be excommunicated and removed from his position. He can never be rehabilitated to enable him to sell meat again, unless he proceeds to a place where the people do not know him, and there restores a lost object of considerable worth, — — thereby proving that he has indeed repented, without any trickery.", 
        "3_Chapter, 5_Halacha": "Anyone who eats an olive-size of the flesh of clean cattle, beasts or birds that were declared ritually unfit for food is to be lashed, as it is written: \"You must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs\" (Exodus 22:30). The biblical term <i>terefah</i> refers to an animal torn by a wild beast, such as a lion, a leopard, or the like. So too, <i>terefah</i> is applied to a bird torn by a bird of prey, a hawk, or the like. You cannot say that <i>terefah</i> signifies that the wild beast or bird of prey tore and killed it, since it would be <i>nevelah</i> if dead; what difference does it make whether it died of itself or was killed by someone who struck it with a sword, or whether a lion mauled and killed it? Hence, the biblical text must refer to a mauled animal that has not died.", 
        "3_Chapter, 21_Halacha": "In reference to an ox condemned to be stoned it is written: \"Its flesh shall not be eaten\" (Exodus 21:28). How could it be eaten after it had been stoned and assumed the status of <i>nevelah? !</i> Scripture only means to convey that as soon as the ox was condemned to be stoned it became forbidden and was regarded as an unclean animal. If anyone hastened and slaughtered the ox properly, it is forbidden to derive any benefit from it; if anyone ate an olive-size of its flesh he is to be lashed.— —", 
        "3_Chapter, 6_Halacha": "If a torn animal that has not died is forbidden, one might suppose that if a wolf came and dragged away a young goat by its foot, tail or ear, and a man chased the wolf and rescued the kid from its mouth, the kid should be forbidden because it was mauled, therefore the Torah plainly says: \"You must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs,\" that is, it is forbidden only when it has become fit for the dogs. Hence, you may infer that <i>terefah</i> spoken of in the Torah refers to an animal torn and mauled by a wild beast to the point of death, though it has not died yet. Even if someone hastened to slaughter it prior to its death, it is forbidden as <i>terefah</i>, since it could not have survived the wound inflicted upon it.", 
        "8_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "The reason Scripture is silent, and does not explicitly prohibit the eating of meat with milk, is that it has already forbidden the cooking; that is to say, since the cooking of the meat-milk mixture is forbidden, it is needless to state that partaking of it is likewise forbidden. Similarly, Scripture is silent and does not explicitly prohibit taking one's own daughter to wife, having already prohibited the taking of one's granddaughter to wife.", 
        "2_Chapter, 12_Halacha": "It therefore is logical that any milk owned by a non-Jew is prohibited, lest they have mixed in the milk of a non-kosher animal. Cheese produced by a non-Jew is permitted, since milk of a non-kosher animal cannot become cheese. However, in the days of the sages, they decreed that cheese produced by a non-Jew be prohibited, lest they coagulate it using the non-kosher stomach lining of animals they slaughter. And if you will say - the stomach-lining is negligible in relation in the amount of milk; should it not be considered nullified? Since it is the very thing which creates the cheese, and if the thing which creates the cheese is prohibited, the whole thing is prohibited, as will be explained.", 
        "8_Chapter, 25_Halacha": "If one has first partaken of cheese or milk, he may eat meat immediately thereafter. He must, however, wash his hands and cleanse his mouth between the cheese and the meat. With what should he cleanse his mouth? With bread, or by chewing fruit and swallowing it or spitting it out.— —", 
        "5_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "If anyone eats an olive-size of blood willfully he deserves <i>kareth;</i> if unwittingly, he must bring a standard sin-offering.— —"
