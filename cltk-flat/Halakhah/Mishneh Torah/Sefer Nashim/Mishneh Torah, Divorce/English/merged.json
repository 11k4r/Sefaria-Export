        "1_Chapter, 19_Halacha": "A person who the law propounds that we compel to divorce his wife, but he [nonetheless] does not want to divorce [her] – a Jewish court, in any place and at any time, [should] strike him until he says, “I want [to divorce her],” and [then] write a bill of divorce; and that is [considered] a proper bill. And so [too], if the gentiles struck him and said to him, “Do what the Jews are saying to you,” and that Jew was pressured at the ends of the gentiles until he divorces her, behold, that [divorce] is proper. And if the gentiles place him under duress on their own until he writes [a bill of divorce], behold this is [merely] an invalid bill, since the law propounds that that he write a bill of divorce. And why [in all of these cases] is the bill of divorce not nullified – as behold, he was pressured, whether [it was] at the hand of the gentiles or at the hand of the Jews? [It is because] we only say he was under duress [to nullify his statement or action] when he is pressured and forced to do something that he is not obligated to do by the Torah – for example, one who is struck until he sells or gives [something of his]. But someone whose [evil] impulse attacks him to abstain from a commandment or to do a sin, and he is struck until he does something that he is obligated to do or until he distances himself from something that is forbidden to do; this is not [considered] that he is under duress, but rather he put himself under duress with his [own] bad character trait. Therefore this one who does not want to divorce – since he wants to be of the Jewish people and he wants to do all of the commandments and distance himself from the sins, and it is his impulse that attacked him  – since he was struck until his impulse was weakened and he said, “I want,” [it is considered that] he already divorced [her] willingly. If the law does not propound that we compel him to divorce and the court makes a mistake or it was composed of commoners, and they place him under duress until he divorces; behold, this is an invalid bill of divorce. [But] since it is Jews that placed him under duress, he should continue and divorce. But if the gentiles placed him under duress to divorce not according to the law, [the resultant bill of divorce] is not a bill [at all]. Even if he said among the gentiles, “I want,” and he said to the Jews, “Write and seal [the bill]”; since the law does not obligate him to extricate [his wife] and the gentiles placed him under duress, it is not a bill.

        "0_Chapter, 2_Halacha": "•\t\"[If] she fails to please him\" implies that he may not give a divorce except of his own free will. If she is divorced against his will, she is not divorced. However a woman may be divorced with her consent as well as without it.", 
        "0_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "•\t[2] And from where to we know that these ten rules are derived from the Torah? From this verse (Deuteronomy 24:1) \"[If] she fails to please him, because he finds something unseemly about her, he writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house.\"", 
        "0_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "[1] A woman may be divorced only by means of a writ that reaches her, and this writ is called a get. According to the Torah, there are ten rules that are basic to divorce, and they are as follows: that the man may not divorce his wife except of his own free will; that he must give a divorce by means of a writ, and not by means of anything else... that it must be written specifically for her... that he must deliver it to her; that he must deliver it to her in the presence of witnesses; that he must give it to her as an instrument of divorce; that it must be the husband, or his agent, who gives it to her...", 
        "5_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "The messenger that is made by the wife to receive a <i>get</i> for her from the hand of her husband is called a receiving messenger. And from when the get reaches the hand of her messenger, she is divorced as if it reached her hand. And it is necessary for him to be designated with two witnesses. And it is necessary for two witnesses to testify on the <i>get</i> reaching the hand of her messenger. And even if they are leaders or one of them is a leader, behold they are [still considered] complete testimony."
