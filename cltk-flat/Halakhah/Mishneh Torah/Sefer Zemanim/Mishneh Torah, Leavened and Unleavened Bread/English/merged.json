        "4_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "There is no prohibition in the category of leavened grains on Passover except the five species of cereal alone; and they are the two species of wheat–being wheat and buckwheat–and the three species of barley–being barley, oats, and rye. But legumes, like rice, beans, lentils and the like, lack the designation of leavened grains; yet even if one had kneaded rice flour and the like in boiling water and covered it in clothes until it rose like leavened dough; indeed this is permitted for eating as this is not fermentation but rather decay.", 
        "4_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "These five species of cereals, if kneaded with fruit juice alone–without any water, they will never come to be leavened; rather even if they are left out all day until the dough has risen, they are permitted to eat, as fruit juice does not ferment but rather decays. And fruit juices include things like wine, milk, honey, oil, apple juice, pomegranate juice, and the like from the remaining wines, oils, and liquids. And these are those that have never been mixed with water; and if water has been mixed with them at all then they ferment.", 
        "1_Chapter, 2_Halakhah": "By rabbinic enactment, one must search for <i>ḥametz</i> in hiding-places and holes, and remove it from his entire domain. Also, by rabbinic enactment, one should search and remove the <i>ḥametz</i> by lamplight at night, at the beginning of the night preceding the fourteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>, because all the people are then at home and lamplight is best for searching.— —", 
        "3_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "From this you can learn that chametz of a Jew that was left in the posession of a non-Jew, even if it was concealed, and even if in a different city or even if entrusted to a gentile, is transgressing \"shall not be seen\" and \"shall not be found\". Chametz that was consecrated or that belonged to a non-Jew and was in a Jew's possession, even if it is in the Jew's house, is permitted because it doesn't belong to him. And even if it belongs to an gentile ger toshav that is under the authority of a Jew, we do not force him (the gentile) to abandon his chametz during passover. But it is necessary to establish a division ten tefachim high between his chametz in order to prevent accidental use of it. But consecrated (chametz) need not (be partitioned off) because everyone shies away from consecrated (things) in order not to infringe on the prohibition of \"me'ilah\".", 
        "7_Chapter, 2_Halakhah": "In today's times we don't say \"tonight only roasted\" because we don't have a [pascal] sacrifice. Begin with shame and read until completion of the entire section \"arami oved avi\".", 
        "3_Chapter, 7_Halakhah": "If one keeps food that contains an admixture of <i>ḥametz</i> during Passover, he transgresses the prohibition against its being seen or found.— — However, if the thing containing an admixture of <i>ḥametz</i> is not edible, it is permissible to retain it during Passover.", 
        "0_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "Anyone who eats an olive's volume of leavened bread on Passover beginning on the night of the 15th until the end of the 21st of Nissan  intentionally is obligated to [a punishment of] kareit/cutting off, as it was said, \"For anyone who eats leavened bread and will be cut off\" (Exodus 12:15). Unintentionally - one is obligated to a sacrifice of a fixed type (i.e. non-sliding scale) of sin-offering. This is [the same for] one who eats [it] and one who liquifies and drinks [it].", 
        "6_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "According to a biblical positive command, we must tell on the night preceding the fifteenth day of <i>Nisan</i> all about the miracles and wonders that were performed for our forefathers in Egypt.— — Even great scholars are required to tell about the exodus from Egypt. Anyone who relates at length about the events that occurred deserves praise.", 
        "7_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "Begin with the blessing \"who brought forth from the ground\" and take a vegetable and dip it in charoset and eat a kazait, he and everyone reclining with him should not eat less than a kazait. Afterwards, take away the table from in front of him and he reads the hagaddah to himself. Mix the second cup, and here the son asks. Why is this night different from all other night? On all other nights we don't dip even once, tonight twice. On all other nights we eat hametz and matzah, tonight only matzah. On all other nights we eat meat roasted, boiled, or cooked, tonight only roasted. On all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, tonight only maror. On all other nights we eat while sitting or reclining, tonight we all recline.", 
        "4_Chapter, 3_Halakhah": "It is permitted to cook the grain or the flour in fruit juice. Same with dough that was kneaded with fruit juice; if they cooked it in fruit juice or browned it on a pan in oil, indeed this is permitted because fruit juices do not ferment.", 
        "5_Chapter, 10_Halakhah": "By rabbinic enactment, nothing may be eaten after the conclusion of the <i>Seder</i> meal, not even parched grain, nuts or the like. Even though one has eaten <i>matzah</i> first, and then some other food, fruits and the like, he should conclude the <i>Seder</i> meal by eating a piece of <i>matzah</i> the size of an olive and stop.", 
        "1_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "What is meant by the biblical term <i>putting away</i>? It means that one should regard the <i>ḥametz</i> as nonexistent or as mere dust of the earth, impressing on his mind that he has no <i>ḥametz</i> in his possession and that all the <i>ḥametz</i> in his possession is equivalent to dust or something entirely useless.", 
        "7_Chapter, 9_Halakhah": "And afterwards, he recites the Grace after the Meals over a third cup and drinks it. And afterwards, he mixes (pours) a fourth cup and finishes the Hallel (a set order of praises from the Psalms) over it. And he recites the blessing of song and that is \"May all of your creatures praise you, etc.\" And he recites the blessing, \"Who creates the fruit of the vine,\" and does not taste anything afterwards the whole night, except for water. And he should mix (pour) a fifth cup and say upon it the Great Hallel (Psalms 136), from \"Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good\" (Psalms 136:1) to \"Upon the waters of Babylon\" (Psalms 137:1). And this cup is not obligatory like the [other] four cups. And he can finish the Hallel anyplace that he desires, even though he is not in the place of the meal.", 
        "5_Chapter, 9_Halakhah": "All are required to eat <i>matzah</i> on the first night of Passover; this includes women and slaves. A child able to eat bread should be fed a piece of <i>matzah</i> the size of an olive [at least] in order to train him in the performance of religious duties.— —", 
        "6_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "It is one's duty to inform the children even if they ask no questions, as it is written: \"You shall tell your son\" (Exodus 13:8). The father should instruct his son according to the child's understanding. For example, he should say to one small or foolish: \"My son, all of us were slaves in Egypt, like this maidservant or like this manservant, and on this night God redeemed and liberated us.\" If the son is grown up and intelligent, he should inform him about everything that happened to us in Egypt, and about the miracles that were wrought for us by our teacher Moses; all in accordance with the son's understanding.", 
        "5_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "The Torah commands us to eat <i>matzah</i> on the night preceding the fifteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>, as it is written: \"In the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread\" (Exodus 12:18), everywhere and throughout time.— — By eating a piece of <i>matzah</i> the size of an olive [on the night of the fifteenth] one fulfills his duty.", 
        "1_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "The Torah commands us to put away the <i>ḥametz</i> before the time when it is forbidden to eat it, as it is written: \"On the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses\" (Exodus 12:15); according to the traditional interpretation, the <i>first day</i> in this verse refers to the fourteenth of <i>Nisan</i>. This is obvious from what is written in the Torah: \"You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven\" (Exodus 34:25), which means: \"You shall not slaughter the paschal lamb while leavened bread still exists\"; the time for slaughtering the paschal lamb is the afternoon of the fourteenth day of <i>Nisan</i>.", 
        "3_Chapter, 6_Halakhah": "A Jew may say to a non-Jew: \"Instead of buying <i>ḥametz</i> for one hundred <i>zuzim</i>, buy for two hundred; instead of buying it from a non-Jew, buy it from me; I may find it necessary to buy it back from you after Passover.\" However, one must not attach a condition to the act of selling or giving it to the non-Jew; if he does, he transgresses the law which prohibits <i>ḥametz</i> from being seen or found during Passover.", 
        "3_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "It is written in the Torah: \"No leavened bread shall be seen with you\" (Exodus 13:7). One might suppose that a man commits no transgression if he hides the <i>ḥametz</i> or deposits it with a non-Jew; the Torah therefore says plainly: \"No leaven shall be found in your houses\" (Exodus 12:19), even if he has deposited or hidden it. Furthermore, one might suppose that a man transgresses only if the <i>ḥametz</i> is inside his house, but if it is far from his house, in the fields or in another town, he does not transgress the law; the Torah therefore says plainly: \"In all your territory\" (13:7), meaning: wherever you have control.— —", 
        "4_Chapter, 4_Halakhah": "Fresh [damp] grain that one flashes in fire and grinds, one may not cook its flour in water lest it did not brown nicely in the fire and one will find that it ferments when one cooks it. And so too when one rubs [flour to cover remaining pores in] the new pots, one may not cook anything inside them except for baked matzah that they went back and ground it, but browned flour is prohibited lest they did not brown it nicely and it comes to leaven.", 
        "8_Chapter, 3_Halakhah": "We were slaves in Egypt and God took us out with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. And had God not taken out our ancestors from Egypt, we and our children, and our children's children would still be slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt. So, even if all of our our scholars or prophets, or elders, know the whole Torah, it is still incumbent (a mitzvah) upon us to tell of our leaving Egypt. Anyone who lengthens the telling of the Exodus, this is truly praiseworthy.", 
        "5_Chapter, 11_Halakhah": "The sages have forbidden the eating of <i>matzah</i> on the day preceding <i>Pesaḥ</i>, in order to make it conspicuous at night.— — The ancient sages used to go hungry on the day preceding <i>Pesaḥ</i>, so that they might eat the <i>matzah</i> with appetite.— —", 
        "0_Chapter, 3_Halakhah": "Chametz which passed over Passover [under Jewish ownership] is forbidden to derive benefit from forever. This is a penalty imposed by the Rabbis on the Jew who violated [the prohibition of] \"thou shalt not see nor shall it be found\" so they forbade it even if he left it accidentally or under unavoidable circumstances so that no one would keep chametz around on Passover in order to use afterwards. ", 
        "4_Chapter, 2_Halakhah": "One may not cook grains in water like bulgur and not flour like fritters. And if one cooked these indeed these are totally leavened breads; and these are those that have cracked during cooking One may not brown dough in oil on a pan, but one may cook [matzah] bread and browned flour. And if one boiled water a lot and afterwards put flour into it, indeed this is permitted because it is cooked instantly before it can leaven. It was already the custom in Shin'ar (Babylonia), in Spain and in all the West (Egypt and North Africa) to prohibit this by decree lest the water not be boiled quite nicely.", 
        "0_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "The leavened bread on Passover is forbidden to derive pleasure from as it is stated: \"You will not eat hametz\" - there should be no permissive scenario of eating.", 
        "6_Chapter, 2_Halakhah": "On the first night of <i>Pesaḥ</i>, one should introduce some change at the table, so that the children who will notice it may ask, saying: \"Why is this night different from all other nights?\" And he in turn will reply: \"This is what happened.\" In what manner, for example, should he introduce a change? He may distribute parched grain or nuts to the children; remove the table from its usual place; snatch the unleavened bread from hand to hand, and so on. If he has no son, his wife should ask the questions; if he has no wife, they should ask one another: \"Why is this night different?\"—even if they are all scholars. If one is alone, he should ask himself: \"Why is this night different?\""
