        "5_Chapter, 22_Halakhah": "23 We do not place the bier of the dead in the [town] square on the [intermediary days of the] festival, so as not to encourage eulogies. Rather [it goes directly] from his house to his grave. And we do not mourn on the festival. And likewise do we not tear [our garments], nor provide a meal (for mourners after the funeral), nor expose the shoulder for a death on the festival - except for his relatives that are obligated to mourn for him. But if [the deceased] was a sage or a proper person or one was standing in front of him at the time of the taking of the soul (the time of his death) - such a one should surely tear for him on the festival, even though he is not his relative. And we do not tear on the second day holiday at all - not even the relatives of the dead person.", 
        "1_Chapter, 4_Halakhah": " ", 
        "5_Chapter, 20_Halakhah": "21 The court is obligated to set up guards on the festivals to go around and inspect gardens, orchards and riverbanks, so that men and women not gather there [together] to eat and drink and [possibly] come to sin. And likewise should they warn all of the people about this thing - so that men and women not mix in their houses for joy - nor be drawn after wine - lest they come to sin.", 
        "6_Chapter, 13_Halakhah": "14 And it is permissible to write letters of greetings on the festival. And one may write his calculations and calculate his expenditures. For a person is not very careful in the refinement of writing these. ", 
        "7_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "2 [In a case of] a furrow half of which is low and half of which is high: One may not not draw water from the low place to irrigate the high place - as it involves great toil. But it is permissible to draw water to irrigate vegetables in order to eat them on the festival. However it is forbidden if it is [only] to beautify them.", 
        "5_Chapter, 15_Halakhah": "In the same way that there is an obligation to honor the Sabbath and to delight in it those obligations apply to the festivals. As it is stated (Isaiah 58:13) \"to the Holy God who is honored\" and all of the holidays are referred to as (Leviticus 23:7) \"a time of holiness\". We have already addressed the ideas of honor and delight in the laws of the Sabbath. It is therefore fitting for a person to refrain from feasting on the eve of festivals from the time of minha just as we do on Sabbath eve as this is part of obligation of honoring. And, anyone who disgraces the festivals, it is as if he as served foreign worship.", 
        "0_Chapter, 3_Halakhah": "Any act that is culpable on the Sabbath is punishable with lashing if it is committed on a holyday and not for the purpose of food. This does not include the prohibition against conveying objects from one domain to another, and the prohibition against starting a fire on the Sabbath. Since the transfer of objects from one domain to another has been made permissible for the purpose of preparing food, it has been made permissible even for purposes other than food preparation.— — So too, it is permissible to start a fire on a holyday even when it is not needed for the preparation of food. Other acts, however, are permissible on a holyday only when they are needed for the preparation of food; for example: slaughtering, baking, kneading, and the like. — —", 
        "4_Chapter, 9_Halakhah": "10 (Regarding the limits of their movement,) items are surely like the feet of the one who acquired them. And items of a Kuthite (gentile) acquire rest in their place, so they have two thousand ells in every direction from their place. [This is] a decree about Kuthite owners, on account of Israelite owners. Fruits that went out of their place (perimeter limits) and came back - even volitionally - did not lose their place (and the limits that are thereby granted them). For they are like a person that went out by force and came back by force.  ", 
        "7_Chapter, 9_Halakhah": "10 We may not remove worms from trees, nor place manure on saplings, nor prune [trees]. But one may smear trees and the fruit that are on them with oil. And we may uproot flax because it is fit to cover with on the festival. And we may cut hops because it is fit to brew it for beer on the festival. And likewise anything that is similar to this. ", 
        "3_Chapter, 23_Halakhah": "24 One may go to a storekeeper, a shepherd who [knows] him or a livestock raiser who [knows] him and take animals and fowl and all that he wants. And that is so long as he does not mention any money or any amount of counting", 
        "4_Chapter, 18_Halakhah": "19 How is this? See [if] the first one put his <i>eruv</i> a distance of a thousand ells to the east of the place of the cloak and the second made his <i>eruv</i> a distance of five hundred ells to the west of the place of the cloak: When the first one takes the cloak, he may only transport it a thousand and five hundred ells to the east from the place of the cloak - which is the end of the perimeter to which the one that made an <i>eruv</i> in the west may walk; and when the second one takes this vessel, he may only transport it a thousand ells in the west from the place of the vessel - which is the end of the perimeter to which the one that made an <i>eruv</i> in the east may walk. Hence, if this one made his <i>eruv</i> a distance of two thousand ells to the east of the place of the cloak and that one made it  a distance of two thousand ells to the west - they may surely not move it from its place.", 
        "2_Chapter, 3_Halakhah": "4 One who flays the hide of an animal on a holiday may not salt it - as it comes out that he is doing a forbidden type of work, not for the sake of eating. But he may place it in front of a place of trampling, in order that [people] will trample it and it will not go bad. And [the Sages] only permitted this because of the joy of the holiday - such that one will not prevent himself from slaughtering (out of concern for what will happen to the hide). But it is permissible to salt roast meat on top of its hide; and we act craftily about this thing. How is that? One may salt a little meat from here and a little meat from there until he salts all of the hide.", 
        "1_Chapter, 10_Halakhah": "11 It is forbidden to use wood that has shed from a palm tree on a holiday to feed a fire - because it is 'born' (<i>nolad</i>) [on the holiday]. But if they shed into the oven, one increases prepared wood over them (so that the new wood is the majority) and feeds the fire with them. We do not start using a pile of straw or a storehouse of wood on a holiday, unless one prepared [them] from the eve - as they are <i>muktseh</i>. But if the straw was mixed with thorns - such that it is surely only fit for feeding a fire - it is surely prepared. ", 
        "2_Chapter, 16_Halakhah": "17 We may not strain mustard in its strainer, because it appears like sorting. But we may place a [beaten] egg in a mustard strainer, and [the mustard] will become strained on its own. If a strainer was already suspended, it is permissible to put wine into it on a holiday. However one should not suspend [it] at the outset, so that he not act in the way that he acts on [weekdays]. But he may act craftily and suspend the strainer to hang pomegranates; he [then] suspends the pomegranates and after that puts the [wine] sediments into it.  ", 
        "5_Chapter, 19_Halakhah": "When one eats and drinks on a festival, he should not unduly indulge in wine, merriment and frivolity, thinking that the more anyone partakes of this the more he observes a religious celebration. Drunkenness, jesting and levity are not rejoicing but madness and folly, and we are not charged to indulge in madness and folly but in the kind of rejoicing that finds expression in the worship of the Creator of all things, as it is written: \"Because you have not served the Lord your God with joy and with a glad heart for all your abundance…\" (Deuteronomy 28:47). This proves that one should worship with joy, while it is impossible to serve God by jesting, frivolity, or drunkenness.", 
        "3_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "One may not start a fire on a holyday by rubbing sticks or stones or metal together, or by striking one against the other until fire is produced.— — On a holyday, one is permitted to start a fire only by means of an already existing fire; but not to start a new fire, since it is possible to start it on the day preceding the festival.", 
        "1_Chapter, 13_Halakhah": "14 We may take wood that is leaning on the sides of a hut and feed a fire with it. But we may not bring it from the field, even it it was gathered there from the eve [of the holiday]. But one may gather [wood] in the field in front of him and kindle [it] there. And we may bring from [wood] that was gathered in a private domain - and even if it was encircled not for the purpose of residence. And that is so long as it has a boundary and it be within the Shabbat perimeter. But if it lacks one of all these [things], it is surely <i>muktseh</i>.", 
        "1_Chapter, 6_Halakhah": "Fish that are in large Bribbin, and similarly domesticated animals and fowl that are in large Bribbin, anything that is  lacking trapping to the point that [the owners] say \"Come from the trap and we will trap it\"- these [Animals in these traps] are Muktzeh and one cannot trap them on Yom Tov and if one were to trap [these animals in these large Bribbin]- it may not be eaten. Anything that does not require trapping is considered to be prepared and may be trapped on Yom Tov and eaten. Similarly and domesticated animal that is cooped up in an area near a city and gives birth to young- while they [the young] are still little and do not require to be trapped [to slaughter them]- [also] do not required to be set aside [for Yom Tov] because he had his mind on them [to be used for Yom Tov]", 
        "2_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "2 And likewise may one who slaughtered a wild animal or fowl from the eve of a holiday not cover their blood on the holiday. [If] he slaughtered a domesticated animal, a wild animal and a fowl on a holiday and their blood mixed together, he should not cover it until the evening. However if he has dirt prepared or ash and can cover all of it with one shovelful, such a one should surely cover it. ", 
        "3_Chapter, 12_Halakhah": "13 We may set up vessels that are made of parts  - such as a candelabrum made of rings, or a chair or a table made of many parts - on a holiday. And that is so long as he does not implant. For there is no [true] building regarding vessels. It is permissible to arrange stones [for] a toilet on a holiday: It is a temporary building (which is only a rabbinic prohibition) - and they did not decree [here] on account of [personal] dignity.", 
        "5_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "Why is it called <i>eruv?</i> The same as an <i>eruv</i>, prepared for courtyards and alleys on Friday, is a distinguishing mark preventing the residents from supposing that it is permissible to transfer objects from one domain to another, the <i>eruv</i> dish is a symbol and a reminder, lest some come to think vaguely that it is permissible to bake on a holyday what is not to be eaten on the same day. Hence, it is called the <i>eruv</i> of dishes.", 
        "7_Chapter, 20_Halakhah": "21 We may take and bring vessels from the house of a craftsman on the fourteenth after midday, even though they are not for the needs of the festival. And we may rake manure from under the feet of animals and remove it to the dumping ground. And we may set up coops for chickens. [In a case of] a chicken that sat on eggs three days or more and [then] died: We may place another [chicken] in its place on the fourteenth so that the eggs will not go bad. But we do not place [it there] on the festival. However if it fled on the festival from on top of the eggs, we may put it back in its place. ", 
        "6_Chapter, 7_Halakhah": "8 We may brew beer on a festival for the needs of the festival; but [if it is] not for the needs of the festival, it is forbidden. [This applies] both to date beer and to barley beer. Even though he has old [beer], he may act craftily and drink from the new - for this [type of] acting craftily is not recognizable to the onlooker. And likewise anything that is similar to this", 
        "3_Chapter, 7_Halakhah": "8 We may not break earthenware nor tear paper to roast upon them. Nor may we split a reed to make it into a skewer to roast salted foods with it. And one may not mend a skewer that has bent - even though he is able to straighten it with his hand (without a tool).  One may not separate two vessels that were connected at the beginning of their production - such as two lamps or two cups - because it is like fixing a vessel. ", 
        "6_Chapter, 18_Halakhah": "19 But all of these, who had time to shave before the festival and [yet] did not shave, are forbidden. However, a nazirite and a <i>metsora</i> whose time for shaving arrived either in the middle of the festival or before the festival are permitted to shave on the festival - even though they had time [before then. This is] so that they not delay their sacrifices. And anyone who leaves a state of ritual impurity for a state of ritual purity is permitted to shave on the festival. And it is permissible to shave an infant that was [newly] born - whether [the birth was] on the festival or before the festival. And the men of the <i>mishmar</i> (priests of the Temple shift) who finished their shift in the middle of the festival are permitted to shave - since the men of the shift are forbidden from shaving during their week (shift).", 
        "1_Chapter, 14_Halakhah": "15 Even though reed leaves and grape leaves were gathered in an enclosure - since the wind scatters them - they are as if [already] scattered, and forbidden. But if he placed a heavy vessel on top of them from the eve of the holiday, they are surely prepared. ", 
        "3_Chapter, 16_Halakhah": "17 We may not immerse on a holiday a vessel that become impure from the eve of the holiday, [as a] decree lest he will hold on to (delay) it in its impurity. But if he needed to immerse the water in it, he may immerse the vessel with its water in it and need not be concerned [about violating a prohibition. In a case of] a vessel that was pure regarding the priestly tithe, but one wanted to immerse it to [make it pure] for consecrated foods (which requires a higher degree of purity): It is permissible to immerse it. And likewise anything that is similar to this of immersions [to raise it] for the levels of other impurities.  ", 
        "2_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "1 One who had prepared dirt or prepared ash - such that it is permissible to move it - such a one may surely slaughter a wild animal or a fowl and cover their blood. But if he does not have prepared dirt or ash that is fit to move - such a one may certainly not slaughter [them]. However, if he transgressed and slaughtered [them], he may not cover their blood until the evening. And likewise [regarding] a creature [about which there is a] doubt whether it is [classified as] a wild animal or a domesticated animal - we do not slaughter it on the holiday. But if one slaughtered it, we do not cover its blood until the evening - even if he had dirt prepared or ash - lest the onlooker say, \"It is a definitely a wild animal, and that is why he covered its blood on a holiday\"; so the onlooker will come to permit [that species'] forbidden fat (carried by domesticated animals). ", 
        "2_Chapter, 10_Halakhah": "11 We may not anoint a new oven or stove with oil on a holiday. Nor may we rub them with a cloth, nor cool them with cold water in order to harden them. But if it is in order to bake in them, it is permissible. We may not heat up stones to roast or bake on them, because it will harden [the stones]. But we may feed the fire and bake in a baker’s oven; and we may heat water in a large urn. ", 
        "0_Chapter, 12_Halakhah": "13 We do not bake or cook on a holiday in order to feed Kuthites (gentiles) or dogs. As it is stated (Exodus 12:16), \"it alone shall be made for yourselves\" - \"for yourselves,\" and not for Kuthites; \"for yourselves,\" and not for dogs. Hence we invite a gentile on Shabbat, but we do not invite him on a holiday, [as a] decree lest one increase [food preparation] on his account. But [if] the Kuthite comes on his own, he may eat what they are eating with them, as [the Israelite] has already prepared it.", 
        "2_Chapter, 5_Halakhah": "6 One who flays an animal may not 'foot' it on a holiday. How does [one] 'foot?' This is one who extracts all of the meat through one foot, so that he may remove the whole hide intact, and not torn. [The prohibition is] because the toil in this [type of] flaying is a great toil, and there is no need for it for the festival. And it is likewise forbidden to make a handle in the meat - and that is when he does it with a knife, such that he not do it in the way that he does it on [weekdays]. But it is permissible to make a sign in the meat. ", 
        "6_Chapter, 8_Halakhah": "9 When craftsmen do any type of work that is for the needs of the festival, they must do it in private. How is that? Hunters, millers and harvesters [who bring their wares] to sell in the marketplace - these surely do [their work] in private for the needs of the festival. And if they did [it] for the needs of the festival, and there was [some] left over, it is permissible.", 
        "4_Chapter, 11_Halakhah": "12 [In a case of] one who invited guests for the holiday: They may not transport portions in their hands to a place where the meal's host may not go. For all of the meal is like the feet of the meal's host, not like the feet of the guests. [This is] unless another [person] acquired these portions for them from the eve of the holiday.", 
        "3_Chapter, 10_Halakhah": "11 A woman may not enter among wood stocks in order to take from them a firebrand with which to roast. And we may not prop up a pot or a door with a chunk of a beam. For [the Sages] only permitted [us] to move wood on a holiday exclusively to make a fire.", 
        "6_Chapter, 19_Halakhah": "20 It is permissible to trim one's mustache on the intermediate days of the festival, as well as to  trim one's nails - even with an instrument. And a woman may remove hair from her underarms and pubic hair - whether by hand or with an instrument. And a woman may engage in all her usual cosmetic treatments: She may paint her eyelids, she may remove unwanted hairs, she may put rouge on her face and she may apply lime and that which is similar to it [onto her skin]. And [the latter is] so long as she can peel it off during the festival.", 
        "1_Chapter, 15_Halakhah": "16 [In a case of] an animal that died on a holiday: If it was in danger [of death] from the eve of the holiday, one may surely cut it up for the dogs. But if not - since his mind was not on it - this is surely <i>muktseh</i>, and he may not move it from its place. One may not move a consecrated animal that has died or priestly tithe that has become impure from its place.", 
        "3_Chapter, 6_Halakhah": "7 We may not blow with a bellows on a holiday so that we do not act in the way that craftsmen do; but we may blow with a tube. We may not make coals; and we may not twist a wick nor may we singe it or cut it into two with a tool. But one may squash it with the hand, soak it in oil, place it across two lamps and kindle [it] in the middle - and it comes out that the wick is split [into two between] the top of the two lamps. ", 
        "2_Chapter, 8_Halakhah": "9 How is one to act with it? He must leave it until the evening and burn it. [But if] it was the holiday of Passover - such that if he left it, it would become leavened - he should not separate the <i>challah</i>-tithe [as] dough; rather he should bake the impure dough and separate the <i>challah</i>-tithe afterwards [as] bread. ", 
        "0_Chapter, 22_Halakhah": "Thus, non-Jews should attend to the burial of one who died on the first day of the festival; but on the second day, Jewish people may attend to it,— — because the second day is regarded as an ordinary weekday as far as the burial of the dead is concerned. This applies even to the second day of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>.", 
        "4_Chapter, 7_Halakhah": "8 [Regarding] anything that is permitted to send on a holiday: When one sends a present [of it] to his friend, he may not send it it with a procession. And a procession is no less than three people. How is this? See that [if] he sent animals or wines to his friend with three or four people together and they all walk in one procession - this is surely forbidden, so that he not act in the way that he does on [weekdays. If] he sent three types [of items] by the hand of three people together, this is surely permissible. ", 
        "2_Chapter, 9_Halakhah": "10 We may not bake in a new baker’s oven, [as a] decree lest it break and make the bread go bad, so that one will be prevented from joy on the holiday. And we may not sweep out an oven or a stove. But one may press down the ash in them. However if it is impossible to bake or to roast unless one sweeps, it is permissible. And we may seal the opening of an oven with mud or slime that is found around the river. And that is so long as he softened it from yesterday; but to knead it on a holiday is forbidden. However it is permissible to knead ash in order to seal the mouth of an oven with it.", 
        "5_Chapter, 16_Halakhah": "Lamentation and fasting are forbidden during the seven days of <i>Pesaḥ</i>, the eight days of <i>Sukkoth</i>, and the other holydays. One is required to rejoice and be cheerful on those days, along with his wife, children, grandchildren, and all his dependents, as it is written: \"You shall rejoice at your festival, you and your son and your daughter, your male and female servants…\" (Deuteronomy 16:14). Although the festivity mentioned here refers to the peace-offering, as we are about to explain in the section concerning the rules of the pilgrim-offering, it includes the appropriate rejoicing of each man and his children and the members of his household.", 
        "0_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "1 These six days on which Scripture prohibited labor - being the first and seventh days of Passover, the first and eighth days of Sukkot, the day of Shavuot, and the first day of the seventh month (Rosh Hashanah) - are called holidays (<i>yamim tovim</i>). The [degree of] cessation of work is equal in all of them, in that all work is prohibited except for labor that is for the sake of eating - as it is stated (Exodus 12:16), \"only anything that is eaten by any person.\"", 
        "5_Chapter, 2_Halakhah": "3 The measure of an <i>eruv tavshilin</i> is not less than a <i>kazayit</i> (the mass of a large olive) - whether it is for one or for thousands. And we do not make this <i>eruv</i> with bread nor with groats, but rather with a dish which is an accompaniment (to the bread) - such as meat, fish, eggs and that which is similar to them. For an <i>eruv tavshilin</i>, one can even rely upon lentils at the bottom of the pot, and even upon the fat on the knife when he cuts the roast - he may rub it off [for this purpose], if there is a <i>kazayit</i> of it.", 
        "4_Chapter, 17_Halakhah": "18 [In a case in which] two people borrow one cloak - the first borrowed it from [the lender] that he should give it to him [in] the morning and the second borrowed it from him that the should give it to him [in] the evening - it is surely like the feet of both borrowers. So they may only take it to a place in which they may both go.", 
        "3_Chapter, 13_Halakhah": "14 [In a case of] one who is making a bonfire on a holiday: When he arranges the wood, he may not place this one on that one until the structure is arranged, since it appears like building. And even though it is a temporary building, it is forbidden. Rather, he may either throw down the wood in a mixture or arrange it with an alteration. How is that? He places a piece of wood above, and [then] places another one underneath it and a [third] one underneath [that and so forth,] until he reaches the ground.", 
        "7_Chapter, 15_Halakhah": "16 We may not move [items] from [one] courtyard to [another] on a festival - neither from an ugly one to a nice one, nor from a nice one to an ugly one. But we may move [them] from [one] house to [another] in the same courtyard. And we may bring vessels [home] from the house of a craftsman that are for the needs of the festival - such as pillows, bedspreads and cups. But we may not bring vessels [home] that are not for the needs of the festival - like a plow from the smith or wool from the dye workshop. However if the craftsman does not have what to eat, he may give him his wage and leave [the items] with him. But if he does not trust [the craftsman], he may leave them in a house adjacent to him. However if he is concerned about them lest they be stolen, he may move them to another courtyard. But he may not bring [them] to his home, except in private.", 
        "2_Chapter, 15_Halakhah": "16 To what are these words applicable? When the food is more than the residue. But when the residue is more than the food, one sorts out the food and leaves the residue. However if there was more toil in sorting the reside from the food than the toil of sorting the food from the residue - even [when] the food is more [than the residue], one sorts out the food and leaves the residue.", 
        "6_Chapter, 14_Halakhah": "15 We may [take care of] all the needs of a dead body on the festival. We may shear his hair, wash his clothes and make a coffin for him. And if they did not have boards, they may bring beams and saw boards from them in private, in the house. And if he was a famous person, we may do [this] even in the marketplace. But we may not chop down a tree in the forest to cut planks from it for the coffin. Nor may we quarry stones to build him a grave.", 
        "6_Chapter, 24_Halakhah": "25 We may hire a wage-worker on the festival to do work after the festival. And [that is] so long as he does not weigh and does not measure and does not count [what he will need to do] in the way that he does on [weekdays]. An Israelite may not allow a gentile who received contract work from him to do it on the festival - even [if] he was outside of the perimeter. For all know that this work is the Israelite's and they will suspect him, that he hired the gentile to do the work for him [then] - as not everyone knows the difference between a wage-worker and a contractor.

        "1_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "A chick that was hatched on Yom Tov is prohibited [to eat on the Yom Tov it was born] because it is Muktzeh. A calf that was born on Yom Tov- if it's mother was going to be used for meat- it is permitted [to slaughter the calf and eat it on Yom Tov] because the animal is considered to be prepared [for Yom Tov] because of its mother's [status] and if one were to slaughter it's mother while it was still inside- it is permitted to eat [the fetus inside] even though it was not born.", 
        "7_Chapter, 17_Halakhah": "18 Hence the fourteenth of Nissan is forbidden regarding the doing of work by the words of the Scribes (rabbinically), like the intermediate days of a festival. However it is less stringent than the intermediate days of a festival. And it is only forbidden regarding work from half of the day and onward - which is the time of the slaughter. But from sunrise until midday is dependent on [local] custom: In a place where they are accustomed to do [work], we may do [it]; in a place where they are not accustomed to do [work], we may not do [it].",

And it is not necessary to say that we may take <i>challah</i>-tithe, the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw to a priest on a holiday. And charity (tsededkah) administrators may raise charity from the courtyards on a holiday. But they may not announce [it] like they announce it on [weekdays]; but they rather collect it quietly, put [it] into their lap and [then] divide [it] to each and every neighborhood individually.",

And likewise may we not feed a fire with vessels that broke on the holiday, because they are <i>nolad</i>. But we may feed a fire with unbroken vessels or vessels that broke on the eve of the holiday, as they were surely prepared for a different type of work [than was first intended, already] from the eve [of the holiday]. Similarly to this, we may feed the fire with shells of nuts and almonds that one ate on the eve of the holiday. But if he ate them on the holiday, we may not feed the fire with their shells. However there are textual variants [of the Talmud] that have written in them that if he ate them from the eve, we do not feed the fire with their shells - as they surely became <i>muktseh</i>.

But those [animals] that graze and sleep outside of the Techum- if they come [within the Techum] on Yom Tov- They are prohibited to be slaughtered on Yom Tov because they are Muktzeh and they are not on the minds of the people of the city [to be considered to be eaten on Yom Tov].

        "6_Chapter, 23_Halakhah": "24 One may not tell a gentile to do anything that is forbidden to do on the festival. But if [a Jew] does not have what to eat, he may surely do what is forbidden to do on the festival - enough to suffice for his sustenance. And he may also engage in enough trade to suffice for his sustenance. And it is permissible for a wealthy person to hire a poor worker who does not have what to eat, to do work that is forbidden on a festival - so that [the worker] can take his wage in order to sustain himself from it. And we may likewise purchase things that are not for the needs of the festival, on account of the needs of a seller who does not have what to eat.",

        "0_Chapter, 23_Halakhah": "24 These two days of the holidays in the Diaspora are two [separate periods of] holiness and are not [considered to be] one day. Hence [in the case of] something that was <i>muktseh</i> on the first day or was born on the first day: If he prepared it for the second, it is surely permissible. How is that? An egg born on the first may be eaten on the second. An animal or bird that were trapped on the first may be eaten on the second. Something attached to the ground that became detached on the first may be eaten on the second. And likewise is it permissible to color the eye with a blue ointment on the second day holiday, even though there is no illness present. To what are these words applicable? To the two day holidays of the Diaspora. But the two days of Rosh Hashanah are one [period of] holiness and are considered to be one day for all of these things, except regarding the matter of the dead body alone. But an egg born on the first day of Rosh Hashanah is forbidden on the second. And likewise anything that is similar to this. [In a case of] a Shabbat that is adjacent to a holiday and an egg was born on one of them - it is forbidden on the second. And likewise anything that is similar to this. And even if it was born on the second day [of the holiday], it may not be eaten on the Shabbat adjacent to (after) it.",

        "5_Chapter, 0_Halakhah": "On a holyday occurring on a Friday, one must not bake or cook food for the next day, the Sabbath. This prohibition is on rabbinic grounds, to prevent one from cooking on a holyday for a plain weekday. It stands to reason: if one must not cook food for the Sabbath, he certainly must not cook for a plain weekday. Accordingly, it is permissible to cook and bake on a holyday for the Sabbath if on the day preceding the festival one prepared a dish upon which to depend. The dish upon which he depends is called <i>eruv tavshilin</i> [a mingling of dishes designed for the Sabbath as well as for the immediately preceding holyday].",

What is the amount of the counting? See that if one owes him for ten pomegranates or ten nuts, he should not say to [the storekeeper] on the holiday, \"Give me ten [more] so that you will have twenty with me [for which I will have to pay].\" Rather he should simply take it and make the calculation on the morrow.

But they must know that another person acquired [it] for them and made an <i>eruv</i> for them; and afterwards they may rely upon it and cook and bake - even though these [people] did not know until the holiday, they are surely permitted. And a person should make an <i>eruv</i> for the whole city and for all that are close to it within the perimeter; and on the morrow, he should announce [it] and say, \"Anyone who did not put down an <i>eruv tavshilin</i> may rely upon my <i>eruv</i>.",

Those who reside in Eretz Yisrael, however, observe only <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> for two days. In the section of this book concerning the rules of the Hebrew calendar, we shall explain the principle of this custom as well as the reason why <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is celebrated for two days everywhere.",

And we may seal a barrel of beer so that it will not go bad. And we may cover drying fruits with straw, so that they will not be ruined. And we may soften clothes with the hands, since it is the work of an amateur. But we may not tie sleeves because it is the work of a craftsman. And likewise anything that is similar to this.",

But  it is forbidden to bake a dough, half of which is Kuthite's and half of which is an Israelite's - since one may divide the dough. [In a case of a foreign] army garrison that gave flour to an Israelite to make bread for them on a holiday: It is permissible to bake it for them, if they are not exacting when we give a bread to an infant - as each and every bread [that is baked] is fit for the infant. A 'dog's dough' may be baked on a holiday at a time when the shepherds [also] eat from it. ",

And even though they [have an] obligation for joy, and a eulogy is forbidden, it is permitted to eulogize a Torah scholar on them in his presence. And it is not necessary to say that we eulogize Torah scholars on the New Moon (Rosh Chodesh), Channukah and Purim in his presence, even though these days are forbidden for eulogizing and fasting. But it is forbidden to eulogize them (on those days) after the burial. ",

And on the second day, he goes back and says, \"If today is a holiday, my words today lack substance; but if today is a [weekday], let this be priestly tithe for that,\" and he reads a name over  it and leaves it - in the way he did on the first [day].

And one may not go out on a chair (borne on poles by other people) - neither a man nor a woman - so that he not act in the way that he does on [weekdays].
