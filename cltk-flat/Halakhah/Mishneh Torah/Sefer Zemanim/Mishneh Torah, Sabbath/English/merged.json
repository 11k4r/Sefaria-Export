        "21_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "Why did the Sages forbid entering a bathhouse on Shabbat? Because of the attendants who would heat hot water on Shabbat and say it had been heated before Shabbat. Therefore they decreed that a person may not enter the bathhouse on Shabbat even sweat. And they decreed that one may not wash all of one's body in hot water, not even in hot water that was heated on the [prior to] Shabbat; but one's face and one's hands, and one's feet are permitted. Regarding what case are we talking? About hot water heated by fire- a decree because of the bathhouse. But the hot waters of Tiberias, and similar, in it, it is permitted to wash one's whole body in them. And it is forbidden to wash in hot water that is in caves, because the caverns have steam, and one will come to sweat, and do it was considered to be like a bathhouse.", 
        "1_Chapter, 21_Halacha": "The one who is traveling in the wilderness and does not know when the Sabbath day is counts from the day that he erred six [days] and sanctifies the seventh and blesses during it the blessings of the day, and separates [i.e. makes havdalah] at the going out of the Sabbath. And on every single day, and even on this day that he sanctifies and separates on, he is permitted to do for himself [what is needed] for his livelihood in order that he does not die. And it is forbidden for him to do more than [what is needed] for his livelihood, in that every single day is a doubtful Sabbath. And if he knew it was the eighth day since he departed or the fifteenth day since he departed, or similar to this count, behold, this one is permitted to do creative work on that day, in that behold, the matter is certain that he did not go out in a caravan on the Sabbath; and the rest of the days, outside of this day, he does only [what is needed] for his livelihood.", 
        "0_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "Resting from labor on the seventh day is a positive commandment, as it says \"On the seventh day you must rest.\" (Exodus 34:21) One who does labor on it has not fulfilled a positive commandment and also has transgressed a negative commandment, as it says \"Do not do any manner of labor.\"(Deut. 5:14)  What is his liability for doing labor?  If he did it with intent and malice, he is liable for spiritual excommunication.  If there were witnesses and warning given, he is (additionally) stoned.  However, if it was accidental, he is liable to bring a Chatat offering.", 
        "11_Chapter, 9_Halacha": "The one who throws from domain to domain or who reaches [from one domain to another], behold this is a derivative [creative labor] of bringing out and he is liable. And similarly, the one who throws or reaches with his hand from the beginning of the four [cubits] to the end of the four [cubits], behold this is a derivative of bringing out and he is liable. And the one who throws backhandedly [i.e. in an unusual way] is exempt.", 
        "29_Chapter, 13_Halacha": "Marital relations are included in the obligation of enjoyment of the Shabbat. Therefore Torah scholars fulfill their marital obligations once a week, on the Shabbat. It is permissible to have marital relations with a virgin, even in the first instance, and there is no transgression of (the Shabbat laws) of \"injuring\" or \"pain\" to her. ", 
        "4_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "The kindling of a lamp on Shabbat is not optional that if one wants, one kindles and if one does not want, one does not kindle. And it is not a commandment that we are not obligated to pursue until one has done it, for example an eruv for courtyards or lifting (i.e. washing) the hands before eating; rather, it is an obligation. And both men and women are equally obligated that a lamp be kindled in their houses on Shabbat. Even if one does not have anything he will [be able to] eat, he begs at the doors [of neighbors] and takes oil and kindles the lamp since this is [included] in the rule of enjoyment on Shabbat. And one is obligated to bless before the kindling: \"Blessed are You LORD our God, King of the universe who makes us holy with His commandments and commands us to kindle a Shabbat lamp\" in the way that one blesses over all things which one is obligated [to do] by the words of the Sages.", 
        "1_Chapter, 9_Halacha": "A sick person who is not in danger, you can do anything he needs through a non-Jew. How is this done? Tell the non-Jew to do for him and he can do it, to cook or to bake or to carry medicine from one domain to another, and so on. And so to he can powder his eyes [for comfort] through the non-Jew on the Sabbath, even though there is no danger. And if there are any non-work actions that need to be done, even a Jew can do them. Therefore we can raise his ears on the Sabbath and raise the cartilage [of his heart], and we can reduce a fracture, and anything along these lines is permitted.", 
        "0_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "Any place that it is said in the laws of the Sabbath of the one who does a thing that this one is \"liable\", behold this one is liable for spiritual excommunication. And if there were witnesses there and he was warned, he is liable to stoning. And if it was unintentional, he is liable for a Chatat offering. ", 
        "28_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "It is biblically mandated positive commandment to sanctify the Sabbath with speech, as it is written (Exodus 20, 7): \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" i.e. Remember through remberance of praise and through Kiddush. And it must be remembered when it begins and when it ends. When it begins - with Kiddush, and when it ends - with Havdala.", 
        "20_Chapter, 8_Halacha": "We may not ride on the back of an animal on Shabbat. It is a decree, lest one will cut off a twig to [prod] it. And we may not suspend [things] on an animal and one may not climb an animal while it is still day [before Shabbat] in order to sit upon it on Shabbat. And we may not lean against the side of an animal. [But leaning on something that is leaning against] the sides of an animal is permissible. One who climbed a tree on Shabbat inadvertently is allowed to come down. [If he did so] knowingly, he is forbidden to come down. And concerning an animal; even [if he climbed on it] knowingly, he should come down because of [the prohibition of] causing pain to animals. And so [too], we may discharge the load from on the back of an animal on Shabbat because of causing pain to animals.", 
        "20_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "Anyone who levels indentations [in the ground], behold this one is liable because of plowing. Therefore, it is forbidden to defecate in a clear field on the Sabbath [as] a decree lest he level indentations. The one who clears the storehouse on the Sabbath because he needs it for a matter of commandment, for example, he brings in guests or he establishes a place to study, he does not complete [the cleaning] of the entire storehouse lest he come to level indentations. Mud that is on his feet, he wipes on the wall or on a beam, but not on the ground lest he will come to level indentations. One may not spit ion the ground and trample it with his foot lest he level indentations. But it is permitted to tread on the spit that is on the ground and walk innocently.  ", 
        "28_Chapter, 28_Halacha": "And why do we bless over the spices at the going out of the Sabbath? Because the soul is saddened at the going out of the Sabbath, we gladden it and settle it down with a good smell.", 
        "29_Chapter, 8_Halacha": "A person is obligated to eat three meals on Shabbat: one in the evening; one in the morning; and one in the afternoon.  And he must be careful with these 3 meals to not lessen from them at all.  And even a poor person who is supported by charity must eat three meals.  And if he is sick from an abundance of eating or he is constantly fasting he is exempt from three meals.  And it is required to establish each meal of the three on wine and to break [bread] on two loaves.  And so too on holidays.", 
        "1_Chapter, 7_Halacha": "If a sick person needed two figs, and they only found two figs on two separate branches and three figs on  one branch, we cut the branch that has three even though we only need two in order to not increase the amount of harvesting. Rather, we only cut one and do not cut two; and so too with other similar situations.", 
        "23_Chapter, 11_Halacha": "The Sages forbade the carrying of some things on the Sabbath in the way that one does it on an ordinary day. And because of what did this prohibition come to pass? And they said: just as the Prophets warned us  and commanded us that your walking on the Sabbath should not be like your walking on an ordinary day and the conversation of the Sabbath like the conversation of an ordinary day, as was said  \"and speak of a matter\", <i>kal v'chomer</i> [i.e. an a fortiori argument] that  there should not be any carrying  on the Sabbath like the carrying on an ordinary day so that it will not be like an ordinary day in one's eyes and one will come to lift and repair items [moving them] from corner to corner or house to house or move stones away, and similar cases, in that behold one is idle and sits in one's house and loosk for something to busy oneself with. And we would find that he did not rest and had nullified the meaning of what was said \"so that one will rest\" (Exodus 23:12).", 
        "28_Chapter, 3_Halacha": "The essential time to make <i>Kiddush</i> is in the evening. If you did not make <i>Kiddush</i> in the evening whether accidentally or on purpose, you make <i>Kiddush</i> at any point in the day time. Similarly, if you did not make <i>Havdalah</i> at night you may make <i>Havdalah</i> the next day or at any point before the end of Tuesday. However, <i>Havdalah</i> with a candle is only made when <i>Havdalah</i> is made on a Saturday night.", 
        "1_Chapter, 4_Halacha": "And so too if he is injured in his body cavity-- from his lips and inward, whether in his mouth or his digestive tract or his liver and spleen, or in other in any other places in his cavity-- this is a dangerously ill person and there is no need to assess if his illness is heavy enough. Therefore, we desecrate the Sabbath for him immediately without assessing [its severity]. An injury on the back of the hand or back of the foot is like an injury of the body cavity and there is no need to assess [its severity], and we desecrate the Sabbath for it. A fever that prickles the skin [causes shivering?] is similar an injury to his body cavity and we desecrate the Sabbath for him. And so to for all illnesses that the doctors say is dangerous, even if it is only outside on the skin, we desecrate the Sabbath by their word.", 
        "1_Chapter, 6_Halacha": "A sick person whose doctors assessed that a fig needed to be brought to him, and ten people ran and brought him ten figs at once, they are all completely absolved [of punishment]. [This applies] even if they brought them one after another, and even if he got better after the first [fig], since they all brought them with permission.", 
        "29_Chapter, 12_Halacha": "We do not besiege cities of worshipers of stars and constellations less than three days before the Sabbath in order to settle down the minds of the men of war and they will not be frightened or distracted on the Sabbath. We do not set sail on a boat less than three days before the Sabbath in order to settle down one's mind before the Sabbath and one is not suffering too much. And for a matter of a commandment one may set sail on the sea even on the eve of the Sabbath [i.e. Friday]. And he interrupts [his journey] with it on the Sabbath, and if it does not rest... From Tyre to Sidon and similar cases,  even for an optional matter it is permitted to set sail on the eve of the Sabbath. And in a place where it is customary not to set sail on the eve of a Sabbath in general, we do not set sail.", 
        "1_Chapter, 5_Halacha": "If someone swallows a leech, we can warm water for him on shabbat and do anything necessary for his healing since he is in mortal danger. And so to someone who is bitten by a rabid dog or by any animal that crawls in the dirt that [is poisonous and] can kill you, even if there is a doubt whether it is poisonous or not, we do anything medically necessary to save him.", 
        "11_Chapter, 8_Halacha": "The one who brings [something] out from domain to domain is not liable until he brings a useful amount out from the private domain to the public domain or from the public domain to the private domain and removes [it] from this domain and places [it] in a second domain. But if he removed and did not place or placed and did not remove or he brought out less than the amount, he is exempt. And similarly, the one who moves [something] from the beginning of the four [cubits] to the end of of the four [cubits] in a public domain is not liable until he removes the amount from this side and places it on this side.", 
        "29_Chapter, 2_Halacha": "Honoring the Sabbath includes wearing clean clothing. One's Sabbath rainment should be distinct from that of the week. If he has no additional set of clothing, he should loosen his garment so that his style of dress is not like that of the week. Ezra established that the people would wash their clothes on Thursday, to honor the [coming] Sabbath.", 
        "20_Chapter, 6_Halacha": "Fruits that fell on the Sabbath - it is forbidden to eat them until the going out of the Sabbath - this is a decree lest one pluck [fruit]. A myrtle that is attached - one is permitted to smell it since it has no benefit other than to smell it, and behold its smell is found [even while attached]. But an citron [etrog] or an apple, and anything appropriate for eating is forbidden to smell it while attached [as] a decree lest one cut it off to eat it.", 
        "29_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "Four concepts were said regarding Sabbath, two from the Torah, and two from the words of the Sages and explicated through the Prophets. From the Torah: \"Remember\" (Exodus 20:8) and \"Observe\" (Deuteronomy 5:12). And explicated through the Prophets: Honor and delight, as it is said, \"And call the sabbath a delight, And the holy of the LORD honourable\" (Isaiah 58:13).", 
        "29_Chapter, 7_Halacha": "One who is affluent and wealthy and for whom every day is like the Sabbath needs to differ his Sabbath diet from his weekday diet. And if it's impossible to change it, he should change the time of his meals: if he usually [has meals] early [in the day], he should [eat] later, and if he usually [eats] late, he should [make the meal] earlier.", 
        "26_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "The one who goes outside the boundary of the city on the Sabbath is lashed, as it is said, \"one shall not go out from one's place on the seventh day\" (Exodus 16:29). This \"place\" is the boundary of the city. And the Torah dod not give the amount [of distance] for this boundary, but the Sages had a tradition that this boundary was 12 <i>mil</i> outside, equal to the Israelites camp. And thus Moses our teacher said to them: do not go outside the camp. And from the words of the [Rabbis], a person shall not go outside the city other than 2000 cubits, but outside of 2000 cubits is forbidden, in that 2000 cubits is the pasture land of the city....", 
        "1_Chapter, 3_Halacha": "Someone whose eyes are worrisome and both [eyes] or one has secretions or tears flowing out of pain, or blood flowing from them, or if they are in piercing pain, or other such illnesses-- this all falls within the category of a dangerously ill person, and we desecrate the Sabbath for him and do anything necessary for his healing.", 
        "29_Chapter, 3_Halacha": "It is prohibited to set a meal and drink on the eve of the Sabbath, because of honor for the Sabbath. And it is permitted to eat and drink [outside of a meal context] until it gets dark. And even so, because of honor for the Sabbath, a person should inhibit himself from setting a meal from [the time allowed to say the afternoon prayer] Mincha and on, so that he can enter the Sabbath with an appetite to eat.", 
        "28_Chapter, 17_Halacha": "Just as we sanctify on the night of the Sabbath and separate upon the going out of the Sabbath, so too we sanctify on the nights of holy days of Festivals and separate upon their going out and upon the going out of the Day of Atonement, in that all of them are sabbaths of the LORD. And we separate upon the going out of holy days of Festivals into ordinary days of the Festival and upon the going out of the Sabbath into holy days of Festivals, but we do not separate upon the going out of Yom Tov into the Sabbath.", 
        "23_Chapter, 9_Halacha": "All the things that are forbidden because of <i>sh'vut</i>: it was not decreed regarding them <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> [i.e. between sunset and twilight], but rather it is during the actual day that they are forbidden, but <i>bein ha-shamashot </i> they are permitted, and [this case] is when there is a matter of commandment or an urgent matter. How? It is permitted for him <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> to climb a tree or to swim in the water to bring a <i>lulav</i> or a <i>shofar</i>. And similarly bringing down from a tree or bringing out from a semi-public domain an <i>eruv</i> that one made. And similarly if one is troubled, hurried, or in need of a thing that is a matter of <i>sh'vut</i>, <i>bein ha-shamashot</i>, behold it is permitted. But if there was not an urgent matter and there was no matter of a commandment there, it is forbidden. Therefore, we do not tithe what is certain [i.e. know to be untithed] <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> even though the separation of tithes on the Sabbath is forbidden because of <i>sh'vut</i>. But we tithe <i>d'mai</i> [i.e. produce that we are unsure if it has been tithed].", 
        "26_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "You find from what was learned that a person is permitted on the Sabbath to walk the entire city, even if it was [as big as] Nineveh, whether it was surrounded by a wall or not surrounded by a wall. And similarly, it is permitted to walk outside the city 2000 cubits in every direction, square, like a square tablet such that one benefits from the corners. And if one went outside 2000 cubits, we lash him with lashes of rebellion until 12 <i>mil</i>. But if he went out and distanced [himself] from the city more than 12 <i>mil</i>, even on cubit, he is lashed from the [law of] the Torah.", 
        "28_Chapter, 7_Halacha": "<i>Kiddush</i> is only done in the place of a meal. How? One does not make <i>Kiddush</i> in one house and eat in another house. However, if one made <i>Kiddush</i> in one corner, one can eat in another corner. And why do we make <i>Kiddush</i> in the synagogue? Because of the guests, who eat and drink there.", 
        "1_Chapter, 11_Halacha": "We don't birth an idolatress on the Sabbath, even for a fee, and we don't worry about creating bad relations [between the Jews and non-Jews], even if there is no violation [of the Sabbath]. But we birth a non-Jew in your midst [i.e. a non-Jew who does not worship idols], since we are commanded to sustain them, and we don't violate the Sabbath for her.", 
        "29_Chapter, 5_Halacha": "Even if one is a very important person, not accustomed to buying things from the market or getting involved in housework, one is required to do things that are necessary for Sabbath with one's body, for this is its honor. Among the original sages were one who would split wood for cooking, one who would cook or cure meat, trim wicks, or light candles, and some who would go out and buy things needed for Sabbath, for eating and drinking, even though he wasn't accustomed to such. And anyone who increases implementation of this concept is praiseworthy.", 
        "28_Chapter, 4_Halacha": "It is forbidden for a person to eat or drink wine from the time when the day became sanctified until he sanctifies the day [with <i>Kiddush</i>]. And similarly from when the day goes out, it is forbidden for him to begin to eat and drink and to do creative labor or to taste anything a until he separates [makes <i>Havdalah</i>] And to drink water is permitted. If he forgot or it passed and he ate or drank before he sanctified or before he separated, behold this one sanctifies or separates after he eats.", 
        "24_Chapter, 9_Halacha": "Any item that has been set aside because it is forbidden , it is forbidden to carry it. For example, a lamp that they lit regarding the Sabbath and the <i>menorah</i> that has the lamp upon it, and the table that has money on it, even though the lamp went out or the money fell, it is forbidden to carry them, in that anything that was forbidden to carry <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> [between sunset and twilight], it is forbidden to carry it during the entire Sabbath even though the thing that caused the prohibition has gone.", 
        "1_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "The Sabbath is pushed off when it comes to danger to life, like the rest of the commandments. Therefore, they do all the needs of a sick person who is in [lifethreatening] danger on the Sabbath, according to the instructions of the professional doctor of that place.  If there is a doubt whether he needs to have Sabbath desecrated for him or not, and so if one doctor said to desecrate the Sabbath and one say he does not need it, they desecrate the Sabbath for him, because a doubt regarding lives pushes off the Sabbath.", 
        "0_Chapter, 6_Halacha": "Whoever performs a forbidden labor on Shabbat, even though his intention is not for the labor itself, is liable for it. How so? If he extinguished a flame because he wants to conserve oil, or the wick so that it should not be finished or burn out, or so that the earthenware of the candle should not break. Extinguishing is a forbidden labor, and even if he doesn't need the extinguishing itself, and he only extinguished it for the oil or the earthenware or the wick, he is liable. So too one who transports a thorn four cubits in the public domain or extinguishes a coal so that people shouldn't be harmed is liable, even though he does not need the extinguishing itself or the transport itself, but he only does so to prevent harm, he is liable, and so too any similar case. ", 
        "29_Chapter, 4_Halacha": "A person should order his table on the day before Sabbath, and even if he only needs an olive's amount, and similarly, he should order his table post-Sabbath, and even if he only needs an olive's amount, so as to honor it as it enters and as it leaves. And he must fix up his house during the day, due to the honor of the Sabbath. And there should be a candle lit, the table set for eating, and the bed spread, for all of these are for the honor of Sabbath.", 
        "4_Chapter, 3_Halacha": "From the setting of the sun until three medium stars appear, this is the time that is called \"<i>bein ha-shamashot</i> in every place. And it is doubtful whether it is day or it is night. And we rule strictly regarding it in every case. And therefore, we do not light during it. And the one who does creative work <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> on the eve of the Sabbath or on the going out of the Sabbath unintentionally is obligated in a Chatat offering in every case. And these stars are not the big ones that appear during the day, nor the small ones that do not appear other than during the night, but rather the medium ones. And from the appearance of these three medium stars, behold this is certainly night.", 
        "0_Chapter, 14_Halacha": "Any labor that one can do alone, and two did it together, whether they each did part of it, for instance: one lifted up the object from a domain, and the second put it down in another domain, or the two of them did it as one from beginning until the end, for instance: they both held the same quill and wrote, or held a loaf together and moved it, they are exempt from punishment.", 
        "4_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "It is permitted to use a Shabbat lamp. And this is [in the case] that the thing [one is doing] does not need much devotion. But if it is a thing that needs to be precise with regard to seeing, it is forbidden to use the light of the lamp for distinguishing - it is a decree lest one tilt [the lamp].", 
        "1_Chapter, 8_Halacha": "If someone cooks for a sick person on the Sabbath, and the sick person eats, and there are leftovers, it is prohibited for the healthy person to the leftovers because of a decree lest he increase for himself the amount he cooks. But if someone slaughters for a sick person on the Sabbath, it is permitted for the healthy person to eat the raw meat from it since there is no additional action upon which a decree could be made \"lest he increase for himself.\" And so on.", 
        "4_Chapter, 2_Halacha": "The one who kindles need to kindle while it is still day, before the sunset. And women are commanded regarding this matter more than men since they are found in the house, and they busy themselves with the labor of the house. And even so, a man needs to take care and check them on this and say to the members of the household on the eve of Shabbat before it gets dark, \"Kindle the lamp!\" If it is doubtful [whether] darkness has fallen and [whether] Shabbat has entered or [whether it has] not, one does not kindle.", 
        "28_Chapter, 13_Halacha": "One may only make <i>Kiddush</i> on wine that is suitable to have been offered on the altar. Therefore, if honey or leaven was mixed with the wine, even if only a mustard seed sized was mixed with a barrel full of wine, one can not make <i>Kiddush</i> on that mixture. That is how we instruct people to act in all of the West. However, there are are those that do permit the use of wine mixtures for <i>Kiddush</i>. They are of the opinion that the suitability of wine mixtures is not based on wine that can be offered on the altar. Rather, the only prohibited wines are those that have a bad odor or were left uncovered or were cooked. On any one of those wines you can not make <i>Kiddush</i>.", 
        "29_Chapter, 6_Halacha": "What is \"enjoyment\"? This is what the Sages said that one should prepare a fatty cooked dish and spiced drinks for the Shabbat, according to ones financial ability. Anyone who increases in his Shabbat expenditures and in preparing many good foods is worthy of praise. If one is unable to afford (these expenditures), even if one only makes fried vegetables or something similar in honor of the Shabbat, this is considered fulfillment of  enjoyment of the Shabbat. One is not obligated to pain himeself or to ask from others in order to increase his Shabbat meal. The early Sages said \"make your Shabbat like a weekday and do not come to rely on people\".", 
        "1_Chapter, 10_Halacha": "A pregnant woman who is squatting to give birth is in mortal danger and we violate the Sabbath for her. We call a midwife for her from one place to another and we cut and tie the umbilical cord, and if she needs a candle at the time of her labor pains we can light a candle. And [this is true] even if she is blind, since her mind will be calmed by the candle even if she can't see. And if she needs oil or anything else, we can bring it for her. And anything that can be changed [about the Sabbath violation being performed] should be changed when being done. For example, her friend should bring her utensil tied to her hair; but if she can't, she should bring it as normal.", 
        "29_Chapter, 9_Halacha": "Eating meat and drinking wine is considered delight (oneg), as long as he can afford it. It is not permissible though to sit down for a meal on wine on Shabbat and festivals at the time of communal learning. This then was the custom of the early righteous ones. They would pray the morning and additional service in the synagogue, then go to their home and eat the second meal, and then return to the study house to read [Torah] and repeat [Mishnah] and pray the afternoon service, and afterwards sit down for a meal on wine and eat and drink until Shabbat has ended.", 
        "1_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "If he is assessed on shabbat and he needs to [receive treatment] and continue [his treatment] for eight days, don't say, \"We will wait until night in order to not desecrate two Sabbaths.\" Rather, start from today which is the Sabbath and desecrate it, even one hundred times, as many times as necessary-- when he is in danger or there is a doubt of danger, we desecrate [the Sabbath]. We can light a candle for him, and extinguish a candle that is before him, and slaughter [food] and bake and cook, and warm up warm water in order to drink or bathe his body. The general rule of Sabbath regarding a dangerously ill person: [the Sabbath should be treated] like a weekday for anything that is necessary.", 
        "29_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "What is honor? It is what the Sages said that it is a mitzvah to wash one's face, hands, and feet in hot water on the eve of Shabbat for the sake of honor for Shabbat. One should wrap Tzitzit, and sit respectfully, waiting for Shabbat to commence just as one does he goes out to greet a king. And the early Sages would gather their students on the eve of Shabbat and wrap themselves and say, \"Come, let us go out and greet Shabbat, the king.\"", 
        "20_Chapter, 2_Halacha": "Women who play with walnuts and almonds, and things similar to them are forbidden to play with them on the Sabbath lest they will come to level indentations. And it is forbidden to sweep the ground lest one level indentations unless it was paved with stones. And it is permitted to spray water on the ground and there is no concern lest one level indentations in that behold there is no intention for such. We do not rub oil on the ground even if it was paved with stones, and we do not blow on it, and we do not wash it even on holy days of Festivals, and all the more so on the Sabbath, so that one will not act in the way the one acts on an ordinary day and come to level indentations at a time that he acts such in a place that is not paved.", 
        "24_Chapter, 8_Halacha": "Any item that one is careful regarding it lest it should decrease in is value, for example, things set aside as merchandise and particularly expensive items that one is careful regarding them lest they deteriorate, it is forbidden to carry them on the Sabbath. And this is what is called <i>\"muktzah</i> because of a monetary loss. For example: the large file, a pin of the plow, a butcher's knife, a knife of a leatherworker, the carpenter's spade, a spice-dealer's mallet, or similar cases.", 
        "23_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "There are things that are forbidden on the Sabbath even though they are not similar to creative labor and they do not bring [one] [to doing] creative labor. And because of what were [they] forbidden? Because it was said \"If because of the Sabbath you refrain your feet from acting on your concerns on My holy day\" (Isaiah 58:13) and it was said, \"And you shall honor it, [refraining] from doing your ways, from finding your desires and from speaking about a matter\" (Isaiah 58:13). Therefore it is forbidden for a person to go [after] one's concerns on the Sabbath, and even to speak about them. For example, if one would speak with one's business partner [about] what he will sell the following day or what he will buy or how he will build this house or regarding which merchandise will go to a certain person's place. All of this and similar cases are forbidden, as it says: \"speaking about a matter\" - speaking is forbidden; thinking is permitted.", 
        "29_Chapter, 11_Halacha": "It is forbidden to fast and to sound trumpets and to supplicate and to beg for mercy on Shabbat. Even for such [grave] troubles that the community would [ordinarily] fast and cry out because of them; on the Sabbath and festivals we do not fast and sound trumpets, aside from a city that is surrounded by non-Jews or a river, or a ship that is shipwrecked. In these [cases] we sound trumpets on the Shabbat to [encourage others to] aid them and we supplicate and ask for mercy for them.", 
        "1_Chapter, 15_Halacha": "We rescue [an endangered] person on the Sabbath, and there is no need to get permission from a court. And the one who is quick to rescue a life, behold, he is praiseworthy. How? One saw a young child fall into the sea. One spreads a net and brings him up despite that one traps fish with him. If one heard that a young child had submerged into the sea and one spread a net to bring him up, but brought up only fish, he is exempt from anything. If he intended to bring up fish and brought up fish and the young child, he is exempt even though he had not heard that he had submerged. Since he brought up the young child with the fish, he is exempt.", 
        "29_Chapter, 10_Halacha": "It is forbidden for a person to walk on  the eve of the Sabbath (i.e. Friday] more than  three <i>parasot</i> from the beginning of the day so that he arrives at his house while there is till much daytime and he can prepare his festive meal, in that behold the people of the household would not know that he is coming that day in order to prepare for him. And there should be  no need to say [such] if he was being a guest at the place of others since he would embarrass them  because they will not have prepared for him the appropriate thing for guests. ", 
        "20_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "In the Torah, it states (Exodus 23:12, et. al.), \"you shall rest.\" [Hence] one is obligated to rest even from things that are not constructive labor (<i>melakha</i>). And there are many things that were forbidden by the Sages and deemed a <i>shevut</i> (a restriction decreed by the Sages regarding Shabbat). Some of them are things forbidden because they are similar to constructive labors, and some of them are things forbidden as a decree lest one go from them to [doing] that which is forbidden [and would result in the punishment] of stoning. And these are them:", 
        "28_Chapter, 5_Halacha": "It is from the words of the Sages to sanctify over the wine and to separate over the wine. And even though one separated during the Prayer [i.e. Amidah], one needs to separate over the cup. And after one separates [during the Prayer] and one says \"between holy and ordinary\", it is permitted for one to do creative labor, even though one has not separated over the cup. And one blesses of the wine first, and after that sanctifies. And one does not wash one's hands until one sanctifies.", 
        "1_Chapter, 2_Halacha": "When you do these things [for a sick person], do not do them through the hands of non-Jews, children, slaves or women, so that the Sabbath should not be taken lightly in your eyes. Rather, [they should be done] through the hands of the greatest of Jews and scholars. It is forbidden to delay desecrating the Sabbath for a person who is dangerously ill, as it is said [Leviticus 18:5]: \"and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them,\" i.e. and not die by [My ordinances]. Learn that the laws of the Torah only exist in the world for mercy, loving kindness, and peace in the world. It is the heretics who say that this is desecration of shabbat and it is forbidden. It is on them that [Ezekiel 20:25] writes: \"Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and ordinances whereby they should not live.\"", 
        "11_Chapter, 7_Halacha": "Going out and coming in from domain to domain is a creative labor from among the fundamental creative labors. And even though this matter is with the entire body of Torah was said from the mouth of Moses from Sinai [i.e. orally], behold, it [also] says in the Torah: \"Man or woman shall not do any further creative labor for the sacred donations, and the people ceased from bringing\" (Exodus 36:6). From this you learn that bringing is called a creative labor. And similarly they learn from the oral teaching that the one who transfers an object in the public domain from the beginning of four [cubits] to the end of four, he is like the one  brings out from domain to domain and is liable.", 
        "5_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "It is forbidden to say to a non-Jew to do labor for us on Shabbat despite that he was not commanded regarding Shabbat and despite that he said to him [to do the labor] before Shabbat and despite that there is no need for this labor other than [until] after Shabbat. And this matter is forbidden according to the words of the Rabbis so that Shabbat will not be light in their eyes and they will come to do [labor] themselves."
