        "0_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "We are bidden by the sages to read the <i>Megillah</i> at its proper time. It is widely known that this reading was prescribed by the prophets. Everyone is required to hear its reading: men, women, proselytes, and emancipated slaves. Minors should be trained to read it.— —", 
        "2_Chapter, 3_Halacha": "All who are obligated with respect to reading the Megillah (lit. Scroll) are obligated with respect to lighting the Hanukkah light. And the one who lights it on the first night says three blessings, and they are: \"Bountiful are You, Eternal One, our God, Sovereign of the Universe, who makes us holy with His commandments, and commanded us to light the light of Hanukkah,\" and \"...who did miracles for our ancestors...\" and \"who has given us life, and sustained us...\" And all who see it, and had not blessed, say two blessings - \"who did miracles for our ancestors\" and \"who has given us life.\" And on the other nights, one who lights says two blessings, and the one who sees [but did not light] says one blessing, for we only say \"who has given us life\" on the first night.", 
        "3_Chapter, 13_Halacha": "If a [poor] person must choose between Sabbath lights and <i>Hanukkah</i> lights, or between Sabbath lights and wine for <i>Kiddush</i>, the lighting of his home takes priority, so as to sustain peace in the house, since even the divine name was erased [in the oath of purgation—Numbers 5:12-31] to make peace between [a jealous] husband and his wife. Great is peace, since the entire Torah has been given to create peace in the world, as it is written: \"Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace\" (Proverbs 3:17).", 
        "3_Chapter, 11_Halacha": "The precept of lighting the <i>Hanukkah</i> lamp is exceedingly precious, and one should carefully observe it in order to acclaim the miracle, ever praising and thanking God for the miracles which he has performed for us. Even if one has nothing to eat except what he gets from charity, he should borrow, or sell his garment, to buy oil and lamps and light them.", 
        "2_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "During the period of the second Temple, when the Greek kings were in power, they proclaimed decrees against the Jewish people, abrogating their religion and forbidding them to study the Torah or to perform the divine precepts. They laid their hands on their wealth and their daughters; they entered the Temple and broke through it, defiling the things that were pure. The people of Israel were sorely distressed by their enemies, who oppressed them ruthlessly until the God of our fathers took pity, saved and rescued them from the hands of the tyrants. The Hasmonean great priests won victories, defeating the Syrian Greeks and saving Israel from their power. They set up a king from among the priests and Israel's kingdom was restored for a period of more than two centuries, until the destruction of the second Temple.", 
        "2_Chapter, 7_Halacha": "How do we skip [during Hallel]? We begin from the beginning of Hallel until (Psalms 114:8) \"Flint from a pool of water,\" and skip, and say (Psalms 115:12) \"May Hashem who remembers us, bless...\" until (Psalms 115:18) \"Halleluyah,\" and skip and say (Psalms 116:12), \"How shall I repay Hashem...\" until (Psalms 116:19) \"Halleluyah,\" and skip and say (Psalms 118:5) \"From the depths I called Yah!\" until the end of the Hallel. This is the simple custom. And there are some who skip another way. ", 
        "2_Chapter, 2_Halacha": "Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i> should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called <i>Hanukkah</i>, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of <i>Purim</i>. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of <i>Hanukkah</i> is a religious duty imposed by the sages, like the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> on <i>Purim</i>.", 
        "3_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "How does this work? Suppose the people of the house were ten. On the first night, one lights ten candles; on the second night, twenty; and on the third night, thirty; until the result is that one lights on the eighth nigh eighty candles. ", 
        "3_Chapter, 0_Halacha": "How many lights do you kindle on Chanukah?  It is a commandment that one light be kindled in each and every house whether it be a household with many people or a house with a single person.  To exalt the mitzvah, one may kindle light according to the number of people in the household, a light for each and every person, whether they are men or women.  One who wishes to further glorify this and performs the mitzvah in the most choice manner kindles a light for each person on the first night and adds on following nights one light.", 
        "1_Chapter, 13_Halacha": "Residents of villages and open towns are bidden to make the fourteenth day of <i>Adar</i>, and residents of walled cities the fifteenth, a day for rejoicing and feasting and sending presents to one another and gifts to the poor. Work is permitted; nevertheless it is improper to work on <i>Purim</i>. The sages have declared that anyone who works on <i>Purim</i> will never see a sign of success in that work.— —", 
        "2_Chapter, 9_Halacha": "Each day when we complete the Hallel, we say a blessing beforehand. In a place where it is the custom to bless afterwards, we bless. How do we say the blessing? \"May they praise You, Hashem, our  God, all of Your doings, and the righteous and the pious who do Your will, and Your entire people the House of Israel with song acknowledge Your name, for You are Hashem, it is good to acknowledge You, and it is pleasant to sing to Your name, and for ever You are God. Bountiful are You, Hashem, the Sovereign, praised, glorified and beautified in song, eternally living and extant, may You rule for ever and ever.\"", 
        "2_Chapter, 11_Halacha": "The custom of reciting the Hallel in the days of the Sages was a such. After one says the blessing, the great one who is reciting the Hallel begins and says \"Halleluyah\" and all of the people respond \"Halleluyah\" and he would resume \"Praise, servants of Hashem\" and all of the people would respond \"Halleluyah,\" he would resume \"Praise Hashem's name\" and all of the people would respond \"Halleluyah,\" and he would resume \"May Hashem's name be praised now and always,\" and all of the people would respond, \"Halleluyah,\" and thus for each verse. [They would do this] until they have responded in each Hallel \"Halleluyah\" one hundred and thirty times, a symbol for the years of Aaron.", 
        "0_Chapter, 3_Halacha": "On what date should it be read? The sages prescribed several dates for it, because it is written: \"At their appointed times\" (Esther 9:31). These are the dates of reading the <i>Megillah:</i> Every town in Eretz Yisrael or abroad that was surrounded by a wall since the time of Joshua the son of Nun should read it on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, even if it has no wall at the present. Such a town is referred to as a walled city. Every town that was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua, even if it has a wall now, should read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fourteenth of <i>Adar</i>. Such a town is referred to as an open city.", 
        "2_Chapter, 5_Halacha": "And not only is Hallel on Hanukkah alone from the teachings of the Scribes, but rather the recitation of Hallel in general is from the teachings of the Scribes for all days where we complete the Hallel. And there are eighteen days of the year where it is a commandment to complete the Hallel. And they are: the eight days of the Festival. And the eight days of Hanukkah. And the first day of Passover, and the day of Shavuot (lit. Atzeret). But Rosh Hashanah and Yom HaKippurim have no Hallel recitation, because they are days of Turning, and Awe, and Fear, not days of extra joy. And they did not establish Hallel on Purim, because the Reading of the Megillah is the Hallel.", 
        "1_Chapter, 4_Halacha": "If a man read the <i>Megillah</i> without due intention, he has not discharged his duty. If, for example, while copying the <i>Megillah</i>, or expounding it, or proof-reading it, he intended to fulfill his duty with this reading, he has discharged his obligation; if he did not so intend, he has not fulfilled his duty.— —", 
        "2_Chapter, 6_Halacha": "In place where they do a festive day for two days, they complete the Hallel on twenty one days. The nine days of the Festival. And the eight days of Hanukkah. And the two days of Pesach. And the two days of Atzeret, but on Rosh Chodesh (i.e. the new month) the recitation of Hallel is a custom, and not a commandment. And this custom is for public recitation, therefore it is recited with skipping [certain portions]. One does not say a blessing on it, for one does not says a blessing for a custom. And an individual does not recite it at all. And if one begins, one should complete it, and recite it with skipping in the manner that it is done in public. And thus on the rest of the days of Pesach, we recite with skipping, like on Rosh Chodesh.", 
        "2_Chapter, 10_Halacha": "There are some place where they have the custom to double from (Psalms 118:21) \"I thank you for You have answered me\" until the end of the Hallel, doubling each and every word two times. In a place where they have the custom to double, one doubles, and in a place where they don't double, one does not double.", 
        "1_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "If he found a community that already read half, he must not say, \"I will read the latter half with the community and go back and read the first half,\" since this is reading it in its reverse order. Instead he must read it from its beginning to the end in the proper order. If he read and paused briefly and went back to read it, even if he paused long enough to finish all of it, since he read it in the proper order, he has fulfilled his obligation.", 
        "0_Chapter, 13_Halacha": "If, for example, the fourteenth falls on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of open towns should read the <i>Megillah</i> on the preceding Friday, while the inhabitants of walled cities should read it on Sunday, their normal time. If the fifteen occurs on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of fortified cities should read it earlier, on Friday, which is the fourteenth, while the inhabitants of open towns should read it on the same day, which is the normal time for them. In such a case, all will be reading the <i>Megillah</i> on the fourteenth.", 
        "0_Chapter, 4_Halacha": "Although the castle-city of Shushan was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua the son of Nun, the <i>Megillah</i> is read there on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, because it was there that the miracle occurred, as it is written: \"They rested on the fifteenth\" (Esther 9:18). This was made to depend on the days of Joshua in deference to Eretz Yisrael which was in ruins at that time. The inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael were to be considered residents of walled cities so as to read the <i>Megillah</i> at the same time as the residents of Shushan. Although Eretz Yisrael is still desolate, its residents are to read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i> in localities that used to be surrounded by defense walls during the period of Joshua. Eretz Yisrael is thus remembered in connection with the miracle of <i>Purim</i>.", 
        "1_Chapter, 12_Halacha": "On these two days, namely the fourteenth and the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i>, lamentation and fasting are forbidden to anyone anywhere: to residents of walled cities who observe the fifteenth day only, and to residents of open towns who observe the fourteenth day only. Lamentation and fasting are forbidden on these two days of the first <i>Adar</i> and the second <i>Adar</i>.— —", 
        "0_Chapter, 12_Halacha": "The <i>Megillah</i> must not be read on the Sabbath. This is a precautionary measure, lest someone might take the <i>Megillah</i> to a skilled reader, transporting it four cubits or more through a public domain; for, though everyone is required to read the <i>Megillah</i>, not everyone is a skilled reader. For this reason, if the date for the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> falls on the Sabbath, it should be read prior to the Sabbath, while on the Sabbath itself the rules concerning <i>Purim</i> should be thoroughly discussed as a reminder that the day is <i>Purim</i>.", 
        "2_Chapter, 1_Halacha": "When, on the twenty-fifth of <i>Kislev</i>, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil.", 
        "3_Chapter, 12_Halacha": "Therefore, if one has only a limited amount of money, and the mitzvot available to him are either kiddush of Shabbat or lighting the Hanukkah candles, preference should be given to buying oil for lighting the Hanukkah candles over buying wine for kiddush, since both are mitzvot instituted by the Sages. One gives preference to Hanukkah candles, as they have an additional component of recalling the miracle.", 
        "1_Chapter, 16_Halacha": "One should rather spend more money on gifts to the poor than on his <i>Purim</i> banquet and presents to his friends. No joy is greater and more glorious than the joy of gladdening the hearts of the poor, the orphans, the widows, and the strangers. He who gladdens the heart of these unhappy people imitates God, as it is written: \"I am … to revive the spirit of the humble, and to put heart into the crushed\" (Isaiah 57:15).", 
        "2_Chapter, 4_Halacha": "On each day of these eight days, we complete the Hallel, and say a blessing before it, \"who makes us holy with His commandments, and has commanded us to complete the Hallel,\" whether it is recited as an individual or a community. Even though reciting the Hallel is a commandment from the teachings of the Scribes, we say a blessing \"who made us holy with His commandments and commanded us...\" like the way one says a blessing over the Megillah, and over the Eruv. For every clear teaching of their teachings, we say blessing over it. But a matter which is from their teachings, and the essence of doing it is from doubt, such as tithing doubtfully tithed produce, we do not say a blessing on it. And why do we say blessings over the second days of a festive day? Did not they decree them for no reason other than doubt, so that people who not desecrate them?", 
        "1_Chapter, 14_Halacha": "What is the nature of our obligation for this feast? A person should eat meat and prepare as attractive a feast as his means permit. He should drink wine until he becomes intoxicated and falls asleep in his intoxication. And similarly a a person is obligated to send two portions of meat or two types of cooked food or two types of food to his friend, as it says (Esther 9:22) \"and send portions one man to another\" two portions to one man. And all that increase to send to others is praiseworthy. And if he has no [money] he should exchange with his friend: this one sends to this his meal and this one sends to this his meal in order to fulfill (Esther 9:22) \"and send portions one man to another\".", 
        "1_Chapter, 3_Halacha": "If the <i>Megillah</i> is written in Aramaic or in some other foreign tongue, except Greek, only a person who is familiar with that tongue fulfills his duty by hearing it read.— —", 
        "1_Chapter, 15_Halacha": "One is required to distribute charity to the poor on <i>Purim</i>.— — The applicants for <i>Purim</i> money should not be scrutinized; it should be given to anyone who holds out his hand. <i>Purim</i> money must not be diverted to any other charity.", 
        "3_Chapter, 4_Halacha": "One may not light Chanukah candles before the sun sets, but rather [light] with its setting - not after, and not before. [If] he forgot or intentionally did not light with the setting of the sun, he can light until pedestrians leave the marketplace. And how long is this time? Like a half hour or more. If this time passes, he [may] not light. And he needs to put enough oil in the candle so that it will continue to be lit until the pedestrians leave the marketplace. If he lit it and it became extinguished it, he is not required to light it another time. If it stayed lit after the pedestrians leave the marketplace, he can extinguish it or take it away, if he wants.  ", 
        "1_Chapter, 17_Halacha": "All Prophetic Books and the Sacred Writings will cease [to be recited in public] during the messianic era except the Book of Esther. It will continue to exist just as the Five Books of the Torah and the laws of the Oral Torah that will never cease. Although ancient troubles will be remembered no longer, as it is written: \"The troubles of the past are forgotten and hidden from my eyes\" (Isaiah 65:16), the days of <i>Purim</i> will not be abolished, as it is written: \"These days of <i>Purim</i> shall never be repealed among the Jews, and the memory of them shall never cease from their descendants\" (Esther 9:28).", 
        "1_Chapter, 2_Halacha": "If a man read the <i>Megillah</i> by heart, he has not fulfilled his duty. If a speaker of a foreign tongue heard the <i>Megillah</i> read from a copy written in the Hebrew language and in Hebrew script, he has fulfilled his duty, even though he did not know what they said. Similarly, if the <i>Megillah</i> is written in Greek, and he heard it read, he has discharged his duty, even though he knows no Greek, and even if the listener is familiar with Hebrew.", 
        "2_Chapter, 8_Halacha": "The entire days of suitable for reciting Hallel. The one who recites the Hallel back ways has not fulfilled [their obligation]. One who recites and pauses, and returns to reciting, even though they paused long enough to complete all of it, they have fulfilled [their obligation]. One days when we complete the Hallel, one may pause between each chapter, but one may not pause in the middle of a chapter. And one days when we recite the Hallel with skipping, one may even pause in the middle of a chapter."
