When he says, \"In the exodus of Israel from Egypt\" - all of the people repeat and say, \"In the exodus of Israel from Egypt.\" [Then] the reader says, \"the House of Jacob from a people of foreign speech\" - and all of the people answer, \"Halleluyah.\" Until he says, \"I have loved that the Lord hears my voice in my supplications\" - [then] all of the people repeat and say, \"I have loved that the Lord, etc.\" And likewise when the reader says, \"Praise the Lord, all of the nations\" - all of  the people repeat and say, \"Praise the Lord, all of the nations.\" ",

Even though the reading of the Hallel is a commandment from the words of the Scribes (rabbinic), one recites the blessing, \"who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us\" - in the [same] way that we recite the blessing on the Scroll and on the <i>eruv</i> (which are also rabbinic). For we recite a blessing over any definite [commandment] from their words.  But we do not recite [this] blessing upon something from their words when its main doing is on account of a doubt. For example, we do not recite a blessing on the tithe of <i>demai</i>. So why do we recite a blessing on the second day, given that [the Sages] only ordained it because of a doubt?

But on Rosh Chodesh, the reading of the Hallel is a custom and not a commandment; and it is [only practiced] in the community. Hence we read it with skipping; and we do not recite a blessing over it - since we do not recite blessing over customs. And an individual should not read [it] at all.

They laid their hands on their wealth and their daughters; they entered the Temple and broke through it, defiling the things that were pure. The people of Israel were sorely distressed by their enemies, who oppressed them ruthlessly until the God of our fathers took pity, saved and rescued them from the hands of the tyrants. The Hasmonean great priests won victories, defeating the Syrian Greeks and saving Israel from their power.

This was made to depend on the days of Joshua in deference to Eretz Yisrael which was in ruins at that time. The inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael were to be considered residents of walled cities so as to read the <i>Megillah</i> at the same time as the residents of Shushan. Although Eretz Yisrael is still desolate, its residents are to read the <i>Megillah</i> on the fifteenth of <i>Adar</i> in localities that used to be surrounded by defense walls during the period of Joshua.

        "3_Chapter, 10_Halakhah": "11 A guest for whom they light in his home does not need to light for himself in the place in which he is a guest. [But if] he does not have a home in which [they] light for him, he must light in the place where he is a guest; so he participates with them in [the cost of] the oil. But if (as a guest) he had his own house - even though they are lighting for him in his house - he needs to light in the house he is in because of the passersby.", 
        "1_Chapter, 16_Halakhah": "One should rather spend more money on gifts to the poor than on his <i>Purim</i> banquet and presents to his friends. No joy is greater and more glorious than the joy of gladdening the hearts of the poor, the orphans, the widows, and the strangers. He who gladdens the heart of these unhappy people imitates God, as it is written: \"I am … to revive the spirit of the humble, and to put heart into the crushed\" (Isaiah 57:15).", 
        "3_Chapter, 5_Halakhah": "6 All oils and all wicks are fit for the Chanukah lamp - even if the oils are not drawn well by the wicks or the fire does not sit well on those wicks. And even on Shabbat night that is during Chanukah, it is permissible to light with oils and wicks with which it is forbidden to light on Shabbat. For it is forbidden to use [the light of] the Chanukah lamp - whether on Shabbat or on [a weekday]. And it is forbidden even to check coins or to count them with its light.", 
        "0_Chapter, 7_Halakhah": "8 [Regarding] a village [that could otherwise] preempt and read on the day of the assembly: When they do not [actually] assemble on Mondays and Thursdays, they may only read it on the Fourteenth. And any city that does not have ten fixed idlers in the synagogue (ready to help) for the needs of the community, is surely like a village. So they can preempt and read on the day of the assembly. And if there are not ten men [in a village], its improvement is its ruin and they are surely like residents of a large city. So they can only read on the Fourteenth. ", 
        "0_Chapter, 10_Halakhah": "11 A city which is a doubt - and it is not known whether it was surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua bin Nun or it was surrounded afterwards - reads on both days, which are the Fourteenth and Fifteenth and on their nights. And they recite the blessing on its reading only on the Fourteenth, since that is the time of its reading for most of the world.", 
        "0_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "2 It is the same [for both] the reader and the one who listens to the reader - he has fulfilled his obligation. And that is so long as he hears [it] from someone who is obligated in its reading. Hence if the reader was an infant or one mentally incapacitated, the one who listens [to it] from him has not fulfilled [his obligation]. "
