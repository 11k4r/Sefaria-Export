        "1_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "It is pious behavior to redeem the second tithe in this time for the same [value] as they redeemed it when the Temple [stood]. Geonim teach that if a person wants to redeem a <i>maneh</i>'s [worth] for a <i>p'rutah</i>, he may so redeem as an initial [measure], [because] one need not be more stringent [with this produce] than with consecrated [produce]. The <i>p'rutah</i> is discarded in the Mediterranean Sea. ", 
        "8_Chapter, 11_Halakhah": "If a person planted a plant between the beginning of Tishrei and the fifteenth of Shvat, he counts three years from day to day for <i>orlah</i> and [four years] from day to day for <i>reva'i</i>. I saw Geonim [who] have a [different] accounting of <i>orlah</i> and <i>reva'i</i>. It isn't appropriate to to elaborate or rebut them. Certainly, [their] errors are scholarly and the true path has already been explained."
