        "2_, 379_Mitzvah, 3_Paragraph": "If you ask why they are not completely equal, as the verse does expressly state with respect to the second Paschal offering, \"according to all the laws of the Paschal offering shall you make it,\" you should know that the Sages already raised this question (Pesachim 95a) [and answered] that the verse refers only to details that pertain to the body of the Paschal offering, such as eating it with matza and marror, not leaving any over, and not breaking bones, as we have explained.  They derived this from the fact that the verse singled out a few laws, while if the laws were truly identical it would have been sufficient to simply state, \"perform it according to the laws of the Paschal offering.\"  They said, \"Just as the bone is remakable in that is part of the body, so too anthying, etc.\"", 
        "2_, 6_Mitzvah, 0_Paragraph": "<b>Not to eat the Pesach sacrifice uncooked or boiled</b>: Not to eat from the meat of the Pesach sacrifice uncooked or boiled, but rather roasted with fire, as it is stated (Exodus 12:9), \"Do not eat any of it raw (<i>na</i>), or surely boiled with water, but only roasted with fire.\" The content of this is not to eat it before it is completely cooked, even if roasted. And this is the explanation of <i>na</i> (Pesachim 41a), as the meat that the process of heating has begun upon and is roasted a bit but is not [yet] fit for a person to eat is still called <i>na</i>. But when it is completely raw, whereby the heating process has not begun upon it at all, it is not included in the prohibition of <i>na</i>, such as to administer lashes, because of \"Do not eat any of it <i>na</i>.\" But [it] is [still] prohibited by the Torah; as the Torah prohibited more generally anything that is not roasted with fire. And the explanation of \"boiled\" (literally, cooked) is that it is boiled in water or in any liquid or fruit juice, as it is stated, \"surely boiled\" - [to] include all [of these].", 
        "2_, 586_Mitzvah, 0_Paragraph": "<b>To return the surety to the owners at the time that he needs it:</b> That we were commanded to return the surety to its Israelite owners at the time that it will be needed by him; meaning to say that if the surety is something that a person needs during the day - for example, the tool for his work - he should return it to him during the day, and the borrower brings it back to him during the night, and if it is a vessel that he needs during the night - for example, bedding or a blanket - he should return it to him during the night, and the borrower brings it back to the creditor during the day. And the language of Mekhilta, Mishpatim  186 is \"'You must return it to him before the sun sets' (Exodus 22:25) - this is the clothing of the day, that you must return it to him [the whole day. That you must return the clothing of the night] for the whole night, from where [do I know it]? [Hence] we are taught to say, 'You must surely return the pledge to him at sundown' (Deuteronomy 24:13). From here they said, we take the clothing of the day for surety during the night and the clothing of the night during the day.\" And the proof that this is from the count of positive commandments is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said in the gemara in Makkot 16a that the negative commandment of \" you must not enter his house to seize his pledge,\" is a negative commandment that is removed by a positive commandment - and [that] positive commandment is \"You must surely return.\"",

        "2_, 386_Mitzvah, 3_Paragraph": "The mitzvah always applies to men and women.  One who transgressed and dedicated his mental energy to the topics we described, those that cause a person to abandon the knowledge of our perfect, pure Torah and to pursue the views of the heretics that are bitter and evil, or if he strayed after his eyes, that is, he chased the passions of the world and attempted to gain physical pleasure without any attention paid to some positive gain that could be realized from it (for example, to be healthy and able to strive in the service of the Creator), but just to enjoy the pleasures, anyone who follows this path has transgressed this prohibition in perpetuity whenever he does what we have said.  One is not flogged for this because there is no specific deed for which the transgressor be can be warned, as people are made in such a way that it is impossible for them to see only exactly what they need, and similarly to never overreach in their speculations, so it is impossible to define precisely what the boundaries for conduct should be.  Also, this ca be transgressed without any deed at all, and I wrote earlier (Sefer HaChinukh 346) that for any prohibition that can be transgressed without a deed, even if a person does a deed in his particular transgression it seems he is still not flogged", 
        "2_, 20_Mitzvah, 2_Paragraph": "From the roots of this commandment are that which we have written about the Pesach sacrifice. And it is no wonder if there are many commandments that came about this - positive commandments and negative commandments - since it is a great foundation and a strong pillar in our Torah and in our faith. And therefore we always say, \"in memory of the exodus from Egypt,\" in our blessing and in our prayers\" - since it is a sign and a total proof for the creation of the world and that there is a primordial God that has will [and] ability. He controls all of what exists and it is in His hand to change them according to what He desires at any time, as He did in Egypt when He changed the natural processes of the world for our sake, and made for us novel, great and powerful signs. Does this not silence all that deny the creation of the world and support the faith with the knowledge of God, may He be blessed, and that His providence and power is upon all of the general categories [as well as upon] the particulars!", 
        "2_, 399_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "Because of this the Sages taught (Bava Batra 126b) that if the estate holder says that he wishes to disinherit his son or daughter, or that his daughter should inherit instead of his son, or anything similar, his words are irrelevant, as he has no power to change the Word of HaShem concerning inheritance.  Even though we said that a person owns his property for all purposes, to give whatever he wishes to whomever he wishes, even to destroy his property, this is an exception, as this statement counter-indicates the words of HaShem and His laws.  HaShem determined which heir precedes, and a person has no power to change that.  This is reflected in the Mishnah (Bava Batra 130a), \"One who says, “So-and-so, who is my firstborn, shall not receive a double portion,\" [or] “So-and-so, my son, shall not inherit with his brothers,\" has said nothing, for he has stipulated against what is written in the Torah. Rabbi Yohanan ben Baroka says: If he refers to one who is qualified to inherit from him, his words are valid, but if he refers to one who is not qualified to inherit from him, his words his words are not valid.”\"  This means that if he selected on son among his sons daughter among his daughters to inherit the entire estate, it stands.  This is derived in the Talmud from the verse, \"And on the say that he gives his inheritance to his sons\" (Deut. 21:16), which implies that the Torah gav the father permission to select among his potential heirs.  The law is decided according to the view of Rabbi Yochanan for most cases, but not for the first born; the father has no power to disinherit the firstborn in this way.",

Since it is written about it, \"[he] shall surely die\" - and in the explanation, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 52b), \"Any death penalty stated in the Torah undifferentiated is only strangulation.\" We have learned that those that are liable for the death penalty do not have repayment, as it is stated (Exodus 21:11-12), \"there is no money. He who strikes a man and [that man] dies, etc.\" - Mekhilta.", 
        "2_, 41_Mitzvah, 3_Paragraph": "And the commandment is practiced by males, but not by females - as a woman does not acquire a Hebrew slave (Bava Metzia 71a). And [this is] specifically when Israel is dwelling on its land - as so does the accepted explanation (Arakhin 29a) come [to tell us], that [the law of] a Hebrew slave is only practiced when the Jubilee is practiced. And it is explicit (Arakhin 32b) that the law of Jubilee is only in the land. And one who transgresses it and does not do to the slave that which is written about him, nullifies the positive commandment and also teaches his soul to be cruel. And it is almost as if he testifies about himself that he is not from the Children of Israel, since they are merciful ones [who are] the children of merciful ones (Shabbat 97a; Yevamot 79a).", 
        "2_, 536_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "About the roots of the commandment is what they, may their memory be blessed, mentioned in the mishna in the chapter [entitled] Nigmar Hadin (Sanhedrin 46b). As there they said that one who is hung is a curse to God, meaning to say that the creatures should not say, \"Why was he hung? Because he cursed the Name [of God].\" And it will come out in their mentioning of this and their bringing the thing up in their mouths, that they will be profaning the Name of the Heavens and causing evil to themselves.

And so [too] synagogues and study halls, because they are not made for residence. And [also among its laws is] that which they, may their memory be blessed, said that if the public domain is higher than his roof, it is not in need of a parapet, as it is stated, \" if the faller should fall from it\" - and not into it. And the measurement of the height of the parapet is ten hand-breadths.",

And there, we elucidated the root of this commandment and all of its matter, as is our custom in this book - see it there (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 272).", 
        "2_, 378_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "Nachmanides wrote that it is not true that the mitvzah was moved to the Kohanim, God forbid that we should ever say that any mitzvah in the Torah changed, and that the Levites should be disqualified from carrying the Ark.  He seems correct, and we see that the Levites did carry the Ark during the tome of King David, as it is written, \"And HaShem assisted the Levites who were carriers of the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem\" (I Chron. 15:26), and it says, \"And all the Levites were carrying the Ark ...\"  In truth, even though both the Koahnim and Levites are accpetable for carrying the Ark as far as the Torah is concerned, as they are all called Levites, as in the verse \"the Levitical Kohanim\" (Ez. 44:15), and also \"And the Kohanim and Levites sanctified themselves to carry the Ark of HaShem the Lord of Israel and Moshe had commanded by the word of HaShem, with the poles on their shoulders\" (I Chron. 15:14-15).  The Sifrei explains, \"Where was the command?  [From the verse] \"and to the sons of Kehat was not given any other ....\" as they are all called the descendants of Kehat.  Nachmanides also wrote that Maimonides' proofs from Joshua and Samuel are not so clear, and in fact indicate the opposite, as it is written there, \"and he commanded the people saying, 'When you see the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem that is carried by the Kohanim, Levites\" (Joshua 3:3).  The truth is as we have said, that the whole tribe is eligible to carry the Ark, and this is explained further is the Talmud (Sotah 33b) where the Sages say, \"How did the Israelites cross the Jordan?  Every day the Levites carried the Ark, and on this day it was carried by the Kohanim.\"  That is, on the day that they crossed the Jordan the Kohanim carried it alone, as it is written, \"And Joshua said to the Kohanim, 'Carry the Ark of the Covenant'\" so that the miracle would be done by the Kohanim, as they are the holiest members of the tribe.",

        "2_, 570_Mitzvah, 2_Paragraph": "The laws of the commandment are that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Temurah 29a, see Mishneh Torah, Things Forbidden on the Altar 3:8) that the fee is that which he says to the woman, \"Behold this thing is to you for your wage.\" And it is one whether the prostitute is a gentile or a slave or an Israelite that is sexually forbidden to him, or from those that are prohibited by negative commandments. And so [too], the fee of a male is included in the fee of prostitute, but the fee of his wife when she is menstruant is not within the prohibition of the fee. And one who resolves with the prostitute to give her one lamb; if he gives her another  - even if he does this with a thousand lambs - they are all forbidden as the fee (see Mishneh Torah, Things Forbidden on the Altar 3:11). And there is no prohibition of the fee and the price except with their bodies - therefore, the prohibition only applies to something that is fitting to offer on top of the altar (see Mishneh Torah, Things Forbidden on the Altar 3:14, 15). And if one gives her a sanctified animal as a gift, it does not become forbidden, as the holy realm already preceded and took possession of it. And what is the price of a dog? This is the one that says, behold this lamb for that dog. And even if he gave him several lambs for one dog, they are all forbidden. And the remainder of its details are elucidated in the sixth chapter of Terumah (see Mishneh Torah, Things Forbidden on the Altar 1).", 
        "2_, 392_Mitzvah, 3_Paragraph": "The mitzvah applies in Israel, just like the mitzvah of sanctifying the first born animals which only applie sin Israel (according to some authorities), and both when the Temple is standing and when it is not, as it is written, \"And you shall eat before HaShem you Lord your tithes ... and the first born of your cattle.\" (Deut 14:23)   The Sages derived (Temura 21b) that from the place that you bring your tithes (meaning Israel) you must bring your cattle.  If one brought a first born animal from the Diaspora it may not be offered as a sacrifice, as it is completely unsacred.  Everyone is obligated in this mitzvah, Kohanim, Levites, and Israelites, as it says, \"Any firstborn that is born.\" (Deut 15:19)  Even though the Kohanim and Levites are exempt from redeeming the firstborn sons and donkeys, as we have written elsewhere, they are obligated in this.  One who transgressed redeemed his forstborn kosher cattle, even though it is not effective and the animal remains sacred, has violated a negative commandment.  The efficacy of a violation is not generally relevant to the transgression, as we see in the first chapter of Temura (Temura 4b), in the debate between Abayei and Rava.  He is not flogged as he could transgress without a deed.",

        "2_, 42_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "From the roots of this commandment is that God had mercy on the poor one that is sold and upon her father who needed to sell her. And [so] He commanded the one who acquires her to marry her as a wife and to make her a patroness - as He is a graceful and merciful God. And if the acquirer does not want her for himself, [he is commanded] to marry her to his son, as she will also be happy and rejoice [to be married] to the son of her master; or - in any event - to reduce her redemption [price] and help her that she should go out from slavery. And, in any case, he should not cause her to stay under his hand until the time of her sale [is completed] - even if her word is very straight in his eyes.

This is the accepted explanation of the verse (Talmud, Kiddushin 24a) \"You shall work them forever.\" (Lev. 25:46)  Our Sages said (Talmud, Gittin 38a), \"Rav Yehuda said, 'Anyone who manumits his slave is in violation of a positive commandment, as it says \"You shall work them forever.\"'\"  Canaanite in this context includes any non-Jewish person who was acquired by a Jew as a slave; all slaves are attached to Canaan because he was cursed with slavery for him and his progeny.   Even though this section is clearly discussing actual Canaanites, as it says, \"from the peoples that surround you you may purchase a slave or maid-servant,\" and earlier it says, \"As I give you the Land of Canaan,\" our Sages still knew that this really applied more broadly to all people, and there are no differences in law between Canaanites and others.", 
        "2_, 338_Mitzvah, 8_Paragraph": "The mitzvah applied to men and women in Israel when the inhabitants were there, as all the rules of the Jubilee only applied when the land was fully inhabited, as we wrote above.  One who transgressed and sold a field permanently, or purchased a field in this way, if flogged even though their actions are not effective.  This is true if they performed some deed, as one cannot be flogged unless there is a deed.  This is the view of Maimonides.  Nachmanides held that there is no flogging in this case, as I wrote above.",

And to what do these words apply? When he had the intention of having sexual relations. But if he did not have the intention of having sexual relations, he did not acquire [her in marriage]. And from the words of the scribes (Yevamot 52a) is it that the levirate husband should not have sexual relations with his levirate wife until he has betrothed her in front of witnesses, and this is what is called, <i>'maamar'</i> in the gemara. And this <i>'maamar'</i> does not [constitute] a complete acquisition regarding a levirate wife; as the Torah stated, \"the levirate husband shall have sexual relations with her\" - behold, that the matter of levirate marriage depends on sexual relations.",

Brothers and sisters (if there are no borhters) precede uncles, and uncles and aunts (if there are no uncles) precede other relatives.  The general rule is that the offspring of any heir precedes the next relation, and the father always precedes his offspring, and in this way we continue until the beginning of the lineage.  Therefore, there is not anyone in Israel who was no heir.", 
        "2_, 385_Mitzvah, 0_Paragraph": "We are obligation commanded to put fringes on the clothes that we wear, as it is written, \"and they shall make fringes for themselves.\" (Num. 15:18)  This obligation applies to garments with four or more corners, as it is written, \"on the four corners of your garment\" (Deut. 22:12)  'Four' includes five or more, provided that the garment is large enough that the head and most of the body of a child who is old enough to walk in the marketplace unescorted can be wrapped in it.  It seems that this age is around six or seven years old.  The garment must be made of wool or linen to be obligated in tzitzit when it is worn.  If it is missing one of these conditions, i.e. if it has fewer than four corners or is not as large as described, or it is or made from some other material, it is exempted from tzitzit on a Torah level.  Silk, camel hair, rabbit hair, and goat hair are all exempted from tzitzit on a Torah level, as 'garment' in the Torah refers only to those made from sheep's wool or linen, as is also the case for tzara'at of clothing.",

The law follows the view of Rav who said, (Menachot 42a) that tzitzit is an obligation n the wearer, meaning that the obligation is for a perosn to put tzitzot on a garment when he wears it, but a garment that is sitting in a drawer does not need tzitzit.  The law does not follow the other view that it is an obligation on the garment itself, which would mean that is a person owns many four cornered garments he would have to ensure that they all have tzitzit.  This is not the case, as thr law follows Rav.",

And one who is lenient to them not to cause them pain in these matters, will find life, blessing, and honor. And one who transgresses this and pained his fellow with words, with the ones our sages of blessed memory specified--with a penitent or a sick man or those like them--he transgressed this negative commandment, but he does not get lashes, since there is no specific action.

        "2_, 310_Mitzvah, 4_Paragraph": "They said there (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 16b), that four behaviors can tear up the [bad] decree for a person: charity, crying out, changing one's name, and changing one's deeds.  The idea of changing a name seems to be that a person should think of himself as if he is someone else (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Repentance 2:4) and improve all of his ways.  Thus anytime he is called he will remember this change and pay attention to it.  They also said that three books are opened on Rosh HaShanna, one for the truly righteous, one for the truly wicked, and one for the people in between.  The idea of opening books seems to be a parable to describe the attentiveness that HaShem has to people.  The Sages always used familiar expressions to allow their ideas to penetrate the ears of the listener.  The righteous are immediately written and sealed for life. (My teacher explained that 'truly righteous' in this instance means 'totally innocent', and 'truly wicked' means 'totally guilty') [The wicked are] therefore sealed immediately for death, since they have no merits to protect them.  [The judgement of] those in between are left suspended until Yom Kippur, at which time a final verdict is sealed.  They also said (in close proximity to the preceding), \"Beit Shammai said, 'there are three groups of people on the Day of Judgement (meaning after death of each person, which is called the Day of Judgement): the truly righteous, the truly wicked, and those in between.  Here they explain that 'truly righteous' and 'truly wicked' reflect the result of the judgement, which resolves any great questions about the issue.  If you merit, my son, you will be sensitive to this and my efforts will put you at ease.", 
        "2_, 342_Mitzvah, 4_Paragraph": "The mitzvah also includes the prohibition against lending with land as a collateral, such that if the money is not returned by such and such a day the land will belong to the lender (Talmud, Bava Metziah 66a), because the acquisition is not binding as it is not performed with certainty.  That is, a person made the assumption that the money would be returned on time and he was not able to fulfill his intention; this is akin to an accident.  In any similar case it is forbidden to reap the benefit because it is interest.  The Talmud provides many examples of uncertain arrangements in matters of interest and other areas.  My teacher (may HaShem guard him) taught us that any punitive condition, that is, if it is not fulfilled a financial penalty will  be applied, is called uncertain, and concerning this the Sages said \"uncertain arrangements are not binding.\"  Another expression they use is \"any 'if not' is not binding.\"  Any condition, however, that a person makes with his fellow in the form of \"if you do such and such, I will do such and such,\" as people commonly create conditions, is not uncertain, for if it were how could we ever make conditional arrangements (as they all must be dependent on 'if' statements).  Moreover, what could we say about the many conditions that pertain to marriage and divorce?  They are all 'if' statements!  Rather, it must be as we said, that only punitive conditions are considered uncertain, such as \"if I don't pay you by day X the field will be yours,\" or whatever the collateral is, but not for the great many other conditions that people stipulate, such as \"if you go to place X I will give you sum Y,\" or \"If you do X for me I will give you 200 zuz\" etc.  Understand this, my son, give heart to it, and through this a heavy fog will be lifted from before your eyes in many issues in the Talmud.",

The performance of the mitzvah is expressed in the verse, and that is that the Kohanim and Levites would carry the Ark on their shoulders whenever it moved form place to place, such as during war or some other time, and it would not be put on a wagon or the back of an animal.

And so the one who swears to do something and afterwards does not do it is, behold, also among the rebels against light, the deniers of truth. As the understanding of \"swore,\" is, according to my opinion, that he concludes in his heart and says with his mouth to fulfill that thing that he swore about and that he will never change it, [just] as God, may He be blessed, exists and does not change forever and ever.

According to the best explanations we learned that even if he says that this will take effect retroactively, that is, \"My property is yours, and after you so-and-so will have it from now,\" the latter still has no claim as the first is a legitimate heir.  If the first is not an heir and he formulates this retroactively, the latter has rights to the property itself, and the first one receives the income in his lifetime.

And I have already said to you that according to the arousal of a man and his acts will he always be acted upon towards things. And from this root did they, may their memory be blessed, say in the Gemara (Pesachim 106b), that if bread is more beloved to a person, he should sanctify [the day] over bread - since then his nature will be more aroused by that which he craves. And even though in the departure of the day, they did not say this, but rather obligated him to recite Havdalah with wine nonetheless, they were correct with this as well; since they, may their memory be blessed, as well as the perfect Torah, will always choose to go according to the majority. And in truth, the majority of the world will desire drinking over eating at the conclusion of Shabbat; since they have already [eaten] a large meal during the day in honor of the Shabbat. And there is no need to give a reason for their obligating us that there be a <i>reviit</i> of wine in the cup; since less than this amount is not fitting and will not arouse the heart of a man upon it. And that which they obligated us in rinsing the cup (Berakhot 51a), and not to drink anything until he recites the sanctification (Pesachim 105a) and that he recites the sanctification at the location of his meal - all of [these] are branches of the root of arousal that I [discussed].",

And after the confession of his mouth about this, the sage recognizes and sees that there is substance in his words that something new happened to him that if he had had to agree to it at the time that he swore, he  would not have sworn and that this is why he regrets [it]; he accepts his confession and he releases him from his oath. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berachot 32b), \"He cannot forgive [it], but others can forgive it to him.\" Therefore it is never possible  to annul an oath, except with the reason of something new to the one who swore - for example, that he will say, \"If I had known thing x, I would never have sworn.\" As this is like duress.

And the king accepts it while he is standing and if he wants, he sits, and he opens it and makes a b'racha like the manner that everyone who reads from the Torah in the shul does; and he reads the topics which we said, and makes a b'racha after it as they do in shuls, and he adds seven, and these are they: R'tzei, Modim, Ata B'chartanu (until m'kadeish Yisrael)--these are three b'rachos like their nature. the fourth he davens for the Mikdash, and finishes \"Shochein b'tziyon.\" the fifth he davens for Yisrael, that their kingdom should stand, and finishes \"haBocheir b'Yisrael.\" The sixth he davens for the kohanim.

Hence (it is fitting) [in order] to fix this matter in our hearts and that His awe should be in front of us to give us life and merit, it obligated us in this commandment that we not mention His holy name pointlessly; and punished with lashes the one who is lenient and transgresses it.

This mitzah is the responsibility of the father (Kiddushin 29a).  If the father refused to redeem him, the mitzvah devolves upon the son, who then must redeem himself when he becomes an adult.  The amount of the redemption is five Selah, whether it be in cash or commodities (though property rights are insufficient, i.e. land and slaves are not satisfactory).  The five Selah may be given to one Kohen or to several Kohanim, and the obligation is to give it to a male Kohen as the verse says 'Aharon and his sons' in the context of redeeming the firstborn.  If the Kohen wishes to return the redemption money after it is given he may do so, so long as the money is not given with this stipulation in mind.  If he did give the money with this condition the son is not redeemed until he gives it as a full gift.  If he specified that the money was given with the condition that it be returned, and the Kohen was appeased by the child is redeemed.",

Because it serves only as a reminder we take some leniencies with the law, such as only separating a small amount from a large dough, and discarding of it in fire, and not giving it to any kohen, child or adult.  I have heard that in some places they still separate Challah according to the old proportions, and they give it a pre-pubescent kohen boy or girl, or even to a an old kohen who is passed the age of virility. Even though he is impure due to contact with the dead, he may still eat it according to those practices.  It also seems that another leniency outside of Israel is that one may deliberately be cancelled by majority, as the Talmud explains (Bekhorot 27a).  I do not believe the same applies to other prohibitions in the Torah, with the exceptions wood that fell into a fire pit on a festival which can have other wood added to it to cancel those, as they said (Beitzah 4b), \"a person may add wood to them permit them.\"  they explained that the reason is the prohibited portion is consumed by fire, and we can therefore be lenient.",

Yet the death of an individual body should not end the gifts that HaShem had given, but they should propogate on their own to the body that extends from this one, i.e. a son or daughter.  If some misfortune causes him to die without children, it is proper for the blessing of HaShem to revert to some other relative, as this blessing was either due to his own merit or that of his forebearers, or perhaps his close relatives taught him some skill that caused him to amass wealth.

And afterwards, the judges ask the levirate husband if he is thirteen years and a day old and has produced two [pubic] hairs, and they also find out clearly that the woman being released is the wife of the dead brother of this releaser - as Rava said (Yevamot 106a), \"We do not release if we do not recognize.\" And when they know all of this with certainty and the matter is clear to them, they also ask the woman if she ate that day. And if she ate, we do not release on that day, [as] we are concerned lest she ate things that bring her to spitting; and we need the spitting to be from her - as Rava said (Yevamot 106b), \"[If] she ate garlic and spit, [or] if she ate a clod of dirt and spit, it is nothing; 'and she spits' - we need it to be from her and [this] is not.\" Nonetheless, this thing does not impede [it], and if they released her in this way, their release is fit, ex post facto; as behold, the spitting being from her does not impede [it].",

And it is the way of the Gemara to always ask about a matter like this and to say, \"We have heard the punishment, from where is the warning?\" For here too, we have a warning: as behold, we are warned (Makkot 9a) for every person not to strike him, as it is written about one who is liable for lashes (Deuteronomy 25:3), \"Forty shall he strike him, he shall not add.\" And it is a fortiori (<i>kal ve'chomer</i>) about someone who is not liable - and the father is included in Israel, and [so] the warning [for the commandment] is from here. And [this must be the case] even though this negative commandment of \"he shall not add,\" is considered a separate negative commandment on its own; since we have a rule in our hands that anything that has for it excision or a death penalty must also have a negative commandment, except for the Pesach offering and circumcision, and behold with the striking of father and mother, [we know] that there is excision without witnesses and the death penalty with witnesses! And therefore, we have to say that we nonetheless learn the warning for it form the Scripture of \"he shall not add,\" as we did not find it in [any] other place. And the main idea of the warning will be [about] all of Israel, and included in it, we learn about the one who strikes mother and father. And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 85b) that the case of this liability for death of the one that strikes is specifically when he brings out blood from them.

If they estimated about him that he could take twenty, we do not say to lash him twenty-one - since they are divisible by three - but rather we lash him eighteen. And [regarding] one who was estimated for lashes, and when they began to lash him, he broke down and defecated or urinated, we do not lash him any more, as it states (Deuteronomy 25:3), \"and your brother be degraded before your eyes\" - from when he is degraded, he is exempted. If the strap split before they finished lashing him - even after the first strike - he is exempted. [If] they tied him to the column and he took off the strings with his strength and ran away, he is exempt. Anyone who has sinned and is lashed goes back to being [considered] proper, as it states, \"and your brother be degraded\" - once he is degraded, he is your brother.

        "2_, 373_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "From the root of the mitzvah: I already wrote in the introduction to this work that this world was created by HaShem with something that combines physicality and intellect, and that is Man. It is therefore fitting for the dignity of HaShem that this creature attain the most complete level of understanding that can be achieved, as I wrote above.  There is no doubt that without this reason that the intellect is forced to combine with the physical, which is in a state of perpetual sinful baseness, the intellect should be close to HaShem and in praise of Him, recognizing His Honor like one of the ministering angels.  Still, since the intellect does live within the physical it must occasional tend to the needs of its landlord, for a house of sticks and stones cannot stand without a person minding it.  If so, as man is created in the manner described, whenever the intellect can suppress the physical and focus on the service of its Master it is good for it, so long as it does not completely ignore the  work of the house and destroy it.  This would also be considered sinful as the King wished the creature to function in this way.  It is like the saying of Rabbi Yosi, (Ta'anit 22b) that a person may not afflict himself on a fast day, which Rav Yehudah explained in the name of Rav as stemming from the verse \"and man was a living thing\" (Gen 2:7), which implies that the soul should be allowed to live.  On the same basis the wise king said, \"Do not be overly righteous; do not be overly wise.  Why should you be desolate?\" (Ecc. 7:15)  This is the holiness of the Nazir as he departs form the physical.  On this Simon the Just1 said: In the whole of my life, I ate of the guilt-offering of a defiled nazirite [only once].  This man who came to me from the South country, had beauteous eyes and handsome features with his locks heaped into curls. I asked him: 'Why, my son, didst thou resolve to destroy such wonderful hair?' He answered: 'In my native town. I was my father's shepherd, and, on going down to draw water from the well, I used to gaze at my reflection [in its waters]. Then my evil inclination assailed me, seeking to compass my ruin,  and so I said to it, \"Base wretch! Why dost thou plume thyself on a world that is not thine own, for thy latter end is with worms and maggots. I swear  I shall shear these locks to the glory of Heaven!\"' Then I rose, and kissed him upon his head. and said to him: 'Like unto thee, may there be many nazirites in Israel. Of such as thou art, does the verse say, When a man shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite to consecrate himself unto the Lord.' [trans Soncino - http://halakhah.com/nazir/nazir_4.html#PARTb]  Therefore, in order to suppress the evil inclination, the Nazir is told to shave his head and not to fix it up to the way it was before.  He must shave it all for there is no doubt that both very long hair and shaven heads are destructive to the appearance of a person.",

They taught, \"I might have thought that I only confess when they brought offerings, hence the verse teaches, 'the children of Israel will confess.'\"  This  implies that they had a tradition to understand the verse in this way.   Still, I might have thought that confession only applies in Israel, that is, even though one may confess without the sacrifice it is still limited to Israel, as that is the locus of atonement.

And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote about this matter, \"Do not answer me with words from the statement of the sages [in] which they say, 'To the bird's nest, etc.' since this is the reasoning of the one to whom it appears that there is no explanation for the commandments, except for them being the will of the Creator. But we maintain the second reasoning, which is that there is an explanation for all of the commandments.\" And [Ramban] challenged him from that which is found in Bereishit Rabbah 44a, \"And for what would the Holy One, blessed be He, care if an animal is slaughtered from the [front of the] neck or from the back?

And the matter is beautiful, also according to our [understanding], since \"as he has done so, shall it be done to him\" (Leviticus 24:19) - since the intention of the killer was to kill the murdered quickly, as from [the killer's] fear of him, he will quicken his death with all of his might. And so too was the Torah lenient with his judgement to kill him with strangulation, which is a quick death penalty; and not with stoning and burning, which are with great pain. (In the other editions, it is written, \"The truth is that the death penalty of the murderer is with the sword, [whereas] he who hits his father and mother has a death penalty of strangulation.\") However with the statutes of licentiousness, in which the transgressors derived pleasure from the sin and the pleasure continued a bit, they sometimes get burning and sometimes stoning.",

And maybe we shall say that it is from the vineyard being a very important thing and having a very strong nature, that one other type together with it would always be negated and [so] it would not be considered as a forbidden mixture or as anything. And therefore, the verse required two types besides the vineyard. And maybe from the strength of this explanation, we shall also say that the two types that the verse required must be types of grain, which are important for their functions, [just] like hemp and arum, which are important for their functions.

That is the view of the secular scholars, but we are taught that the rights of the heir are entwined with the property of the estate, and when the rights of the estate owner are revoked by death, the rights of the heir become active, in the manner of the continuous chain that HaShem devised for this.  Our Sages referred to this right of assertion of inheritance as 'touching' as in their statement, \"Inheritance touches and continues\" (Bava Batra 115b).

He should then seek atonement and extend his words in this matter according to his fluency.  The Sages taught that even sins that require the bringing of a sin-offering still demand confession with the offering, and on this the verse says, \"Speak to the children of Israel [saying], a man or woman who cimits any sin and rebels against HaShem, that soul is guilty and they should confess the sins that they did.\" (Num. 5:6)  The Sages taught in the Mechilta, \"Since it says 'confess the sin' (Lev. 5:5) it means that the sin must be extant, that is alive and not slaughtered.\"  This mean that the animal to be offered must still be alive.

From the confession of Aaron [which reads] 'for all their sins'.\"  The Sages used this verse to include all negative commandments, and the 'that they did' to include positive commandments, that is, any tome a person has the opportunity to fulfill a positive commandment and does not do so he must confess.  The also derived in the Mechilta from the verse \"all the sins of man\" that sins like theft and gossip also require confession, though he must also make amends, and if he does not do so it would be better not to confess. \"To rebel\" includes all those sentenced to death who must also confess.  I might have thought to include even those falsely convicted, that is, the condemned maintains hos innocence, and to demand that they confesss.

The Sages (Tanchuma, Korach 12) wrote that 'tzitzit' alludes to the 613 commandments when combined with the eight strings and five knots.  I also feel that there is another reminder here that the soul and body of Man belong to HaShem.  The white portion corresponds to the body which is from the land that is made of snow, as we find in the Midrash (Pirka D'Rebbi Eliezer, 3), “Where is the land from?  From the snow that is under the Holy Throne.”  The threads also allude to the body, as they said that the initial formation of a body is but threads, as we find in the Talmud (Niddah 25b), “Rabbi Amram taught: the two legs are like two strands of silk, as are the arms.”  The blue portion which looks like the sky hints to the soul which is from on high,which the Sages implies when they said (Menachot 47b), “What is so unique about t'chelet?  T'chelet is like the sea, and the sea is like the sky, and the sky is like the Holy Throne, as it is written, 'And they saw the Lord of Israel …' (Ex 24:10) and 'The throne appeared as sapphire' (Ezek. 1:26).”  The souls of the righteous are stored underneath the throne and this is why the Sages said (Menachot 39a) that the t'chelet is wrapped around the white, as the soul is above and the body below.

And so did Onkelos translate, \"and a man should not groom with the adornments of a woman.\" And that which they, may their memory be blessed,  said (see Mishneh Torah, Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12:10) that a <i>toomtoom</i> and an <i>androginus</i> (two categories of people the sex of which is uncertain) should, like a woman, not wrap their head and should, like a man, not shave their head, and [that] if they do so they are not lashed - and so in every place, we give them the stringencies of men and of women, but if they transgressed, they are not lashed - is because they [represent] a doubt. But if they transgressed a prohibition that a man and a woman are equal in, it is not necessary to say about this that they are lashed for it.

And if he does not want to desist with words from doing the sin, and we are able to save from his hand the man or woman pursued, with one of his limbs, we must chop it off. And if it is impossible for us to save the pursued if we do not kill the pursuer, we must kill him. And about this comes the prevention to us, that we should not have compassion upon him; but rather we should kill him nonetheless - if it is impossible for us to save the pursued in any other way than by [taking] his life. And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 25:12), \"You shall cut off her hand; show no pity.\" And the language of Sifrei is \"'You shall cut off her hand' teaches that you are obligated to save him with her hand.

And behold, my son, I will write for you the Seder in short, exactly as I have heard it from the sages of the generation: In the beginning, we bring water and wash one hand for the sake of the cup of Kiddush which needs to be held. And this is how it is in Berakhot 43a in the Chapter [entitled] Keitsad Mevarkhin - that with the cup, washing one hand is sufficient. And we do not recite a blessing on this washing. And if he wants to wash two hands for the cup, he washes them without a blessing. And afterwards, he washes both hands and recites the blessing, \"upon the washing of the hands,\" and dips with a vegetable (the vegetable, according to the Vilna edition) and recites the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the ground,\" before [eating it]. But he does not recite the blessing, \"who creates souls, etc.\" after it, since he waits until he eats the marror; and then he recites the blessing, \"who creates souls,\" upon the marror and upon the vegetable. And everything that he did is not an interruption, as we will explain. And after they ate from the vegetable in charoset (a thick sweet dip), we pour a second cup and read the Haggadah with two chapters of Psalms and recite the blessing, \"who has redeemed us, etc.\" upon the second cup, and we drink it. And we do not recite the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the vine,\" upon it, nor \"upon the vine,\" after it. And after they drink the second cup, we wash our hands and recite the blessing, \"upon the washing of the hands.\" And [then] we take half of a matsah and we place it on the complete one and recite the blessing upon the half, \"who brings forth\" and \"to eat matsah.\" And we take bitter herbs and we recite the blessing, \"to eat marror,\" and eat from it dipped in charoset; but we do not recite the blessing, \"who creates the fruit of the ground,\" upon it, since he is exempted by the blessing that he recited upon the vegetable at the beginning. As this is how it is concluded in the Gemara (Pesachim 103b) - that it is never [considered] an interruption unless there is [one of] two things: That he removes his thoughts from the matter, for example when they say, \"Let us bless (say Grace after the Meal),\" and similar to it. And also that [he be engaged in something else, such] that it not be possible to do the two things together - for example that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 87a and Rashi there), \"Drinking and blessing together is not possible.\" And after we eat from the marror with the dip, we wrap some of it on top of matsah and eat a little bit, in memory of the Pesach sacrifice that was eaten upon satiation. And we do not eat more the whole night, so as not to remove the taste of matsah from the mouth, as it is written (Psalms 113:103), \"than honey to my mouth.\" But we can certainly drink water, since water does not spoil the taste. And we also drink the two cups of the commandment, as we do not push off the commandment, [for the sake of] this reason. And afterwards, we wash our hands, but we do not recite the blessing, \"upon the washing of the hands.\" And we pour the third cup and recite over it the Grace after the meals and \"who has created the fruit of the vine,\" but not,\"upon the vine\" after it (see Baal HaMeor on the end of Arevei Pesachim). And afterwards, we pour the fourth cup and finish Hallel over it. And we do not recite the blessing, \"who has created the fruit of the vine,\" upon it; but we do recite the blessing, \"upon the vine,\" after it. And that is if he does not have in mind to still drink a fifth cup. It comes out according to this that we only recite the blessing, \"who has created the fruit of the vine,\" twice - on the cup of Kiddush and on the cup of the Grace. And [we only recite the blessing,] \"upon the vine,\" once, after all of the cups. And the four cups and the matsah of the commandment requires leaning.",

Similarly, a  field may not be allowed to revert to meadow, nor vice versa, etc.  They may not be altered in any way.  The concept is well understood, for the Torah commanded (Num. 35:2-7) that the other tribes cede certain cities to the Levites, and these are the 48 cities with the six cities of refuge included.  The Torah also commanded that each city be surrounded by 1000 cubits of meadow (area that provides opportunity for leisure and aesthetic to the city), and 2000 cubits beyond that for fields and vineyards, which also has aesthetic value for the city and provides some of its needs (see Talmud, Sotah 27b).  This law teaches that those states can never be altered, and concerning this it says, \"The fields, meadows and cities shall not be sold.\" We understand the word 'sold' in this context to mean 'altered', for if it were addressing actual sales it would be contradictory as the verse explicitly says that the Levites can always redeem their lands from a buyer, which implies that they may sell them.",

That is, unless he explicitly states that the proscription be rendered unto HaShem, or to improve the Temple, as the Sages said, \"unspecified proscriptions are to to the kohanim\" (Talmud, Arakhin 28b).

And in the fourth chapter of Ketuvot 46b it appears to be the opposite, that in the entire Torah (including rape) there is no difference whether it is according to its [standard] way or not according to its way regarding lashes and [other] punishments, except for only the one who puts out a bad name. And there is no obligation for the fine until she is a full three years old; but from three full years to when she matures, there is a fine for her. And she is called an adult (mature woman) after six months from [when] the lower sign appears, which are two [pubic] hairs, and during those six months, she is called a maiden (see Mishneh Torah, Marriage 2:2). And this is what they, of blessed memory, said (Ketuvot 39a), \"The difference between maidenhood and maturity is only six months.\" And after she matures (see Mishneh Torah, Virgin Maiden 1:8), there is no fine for her, as it states, \"a virgin maiden\" - and the explanation that came for it is (Ketuvot 38a), \"a virgin\" and not one who has had sexual relations; \"maiden,\" and not an adult, or a child bride (<i>memaenet</i>) or a barren woman (<i>aylonit</i>). And the matter of the signs of an <i>aylonit</i> are known. And anyone who has not seen the lower sign and is thirty-five years old and a day - even though she does not have the signs of an <i>aylonit</i> - is assumed to be an <i>aylonit</i>.

And anyone that has a fine, has [payment for] embarrassment and damage [in the case when] she is seduced. But if she is raped - even if she doesn't have a fine - she has [payment for] embarrassment, as it is not [any] less than one who injures his fellow [and] who is obligated [to pay] for five things (one of them being embarrassment).

Therefore, as long as Israel maintains the Torah and serves HaShem only goodness will come to them, and the flow of blessing and a pure benevolent spirit will support them, and the opposite, the curse and the 'proscription' will come to their enemies and antagonizers. As such, if one of them gets angry and pronounces words f curse and proscription on his property or land, which are included in this blessing, the verse teaches that one cannot remove the rights to it from the blessed one to another authority.  Everything that is owned by Israel, who is the portion of HaShem, is really His, as whatever a slave comes to possess belongs to his master (Talmud, Pesachim 88b).

And also because maybe the main merit is to the dead brother, since he is like the owner of the field and the living brother is like a sharecropper - and like the well-known matter about sharecroppers, that there are some that provide their own seed. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 22b) that any time that his brother has any memory in the world - a son or a daughter or grandchildren from another woman, and even an illegitimate son (<i>mamzer</i>) or daughter - that they exempt his wife from levirate marriage; [such] that it appears from this that the matter is only to memorialize his name and to give him a portion and merit in this physical world (see Guide for the Perplexed 3:49). And behold, with my knowing that there is a major principle and a correct explanation about this commandment with the Kabbalists, I will rely upon what I wrote at the beginning of my book. And there I penned my apology, that I do not silence myself from writing my thoughts about the simple understanding of the explanations of the commandments, in order to stimulate the spirit of the children to ask questions about them to their elders and their teachers.

That is the view of Maimonides (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Shemitta and Yovel 11:1).  Nachmanides (commenatary on the Torah) wrote that this would then be analogous to the Tallmud's discussion in Temura (Talmud, Temura 4b) where Rava said that anything that the Torah proscribed is ineffective and subject to flogging, as he has violated the edicts of the king.  Nachmanides explained it differently, and that is that the lnad cannot be sold to non-Jews, that is, we may not sell to them as a permanent sale.  He explained the verse to mean that we may not sell the land to one who will hold it forever, and that is a non-Jew.  It cannot apply to a Jew because he will return it.

Some blemishes disqualify a priest from performing the service, and if similar blemishes were to be found on an animal, the animal would be ineligible to be offered as a sacrifice.   Some other blemishes disqualify a person from the service but do not disqualify an animal as a sacrifice.  And some other blemishes disqualify neither a man nor an animal, and our only concern is the perception of a blemish.  Any priest that shows any of these blemishes may not serve.  Only external blemishes disqualify a person, but blemishes that are inside of his body, like a missing kidney or spleen, or a punctured intestine, even though they render him terminally ill, his service is still valid.  This is because of the verse, \"a broken leg or hand\" just as those are external, so too must all disqualifying blemishes be external.  The Sages enumerated (Rambam, Laws of Biat Mikdash 7:8) 50 blemishes that disqualify both people and animals, 23 that are unique to animals, for a total of 73 in animals.  There are also 90 blemishes that are unique to people, for a total of 143 blemishes in people.  The categories of the 90 that are unique to people are as follow: eight in the head; two in the neck; four in the ears; five in the  shoulders; four in the eye lids; eleven in the eyes; six in the nose; three in the lips; three in the abdomen; three in the back; six in the hands; four in the genitals; fifteen in the thighs and legs; four in the general form of the body; eight in the skin tone.  Four more significant blemishes apply to people that are not external, and these are: deaf-mute; mental retardation; malnutrition (even temporary); and a person who produces a foul odor (even if the timing is predictable).  In addition to these there are two more that present problems of public perception, and these are: One whose eyelashes have fallen off, even though a meaningful amount remains at the root, and one who removed his teeth.",

The five types of grain that are obligated in Challah are wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye, for it says, \"and whe you eat from the bread of the land.\" 'Bread' refers only to doughs made from these, and they all may be added to the necessary volume.  If one did not separate Challah from the dough he may take it from the bread, as it says, \"when you eat from the bread,\" implying that bread is still obligated.  Even if one first kneaded a quantity that was insufficient to be obligated in Challah, if he then kneaded another batch such that the two combine to the requisite volume, if they are then put into the same vessel they are obligated in Challah.  I heard from my teacher, May God protect him, that this is only if the bread was taken from the oven and put into a vessel that has a trench, but if it was placed on a board or on the floor, or anything else that has no inside, even though they were subsequently placed into a basket, they are already exempt from Challah.  This is what they meant when they said, \"one who removes it into a basket;\" it is only if it went from the oven to the basket.

The soul that the Lord has given to us prevents us, to its ability, from sin. But as it resides here on earth, far removed from the boundaries of heaven, it is often unsuccessful, and the physical will often defeat it.  It therefore needs many guards to protect it from its malevolent neighbor, lest it rise up and kill it, as it is in its environs and under its control.  HaShem wanted to help us, the holy nation, and He commanded us to set up mighty guards around [the soul], and they are: the command to perpetually study Torah day and night, and to wear fringes on the four corners of our garments, and a mezuzah on our doorpost, and the tefillin on our arm and head.  All of this is to remind us to avoid the crimes that we can commit with our hands and to not stray after our eyes or the passions of our hearts.  Therefore, the Sages said (Zevachim 19a) that the Kohanim and Levites were exempt from these things when they performed the Temple service.   As the foundation of the tefillin is as we have said, we are also instructed (Menachot 36b) to not allow our thoughts to wander from them.

And so also with the price of a dog, for this reason: As a sacrifice brings a man to the atonement of his soul, and like the matter that when his sacrifice is slaughtered and cut into pieces, it is fitting for the owner of the sacrifice to think that it was fitting to do to him such, to his [own] body, for the matter of the sin; were it not for the kindness of God, may He be blessed, that was upon him, to take from him a little of his money as atonement. And with this action, it is fitting for him to soften his heart and soften his soul about its sins, to the point that it repents and has regret about what it has done, and agrees to not continue to sin any more - and like I wrote in its place about the matter of sacrifices and in the Order mentioned. And it is known that dogs are brazen-souled, and maybe from his thinking about them and their strong nature, his soul will strengthen itself, and he will become stiff-necked [against] regretting his sins, as is fit for him.

For them His concern is for the species as a whole, and we are therefore forbidden from destroying the tree and its offshoots at once, to hint to this.

As one can answer you, and it is [perfectly] true, that everything that comes in Scripture similar to these matters is all stated from the angle of the receivers, which are people. As God forbid to Him and for our hearts to believe that the Master of all would need to swear about something, or that He would need to annul it and negate it afterwards. Rather this thing is said from the angle of receiving punishment which comes to the one punished - that if a man is liable, due to the greatness of his sin, that he be punished regardless, to the point where it is not fitting to give him [the possibility] of repentance, the notion of an oath of God will come upon such a man; meaning to say [that] his punishment and decree is strongly upon him as if there were an oath on the thing. And so [too], for the good: if a man merited, from his great significance, to receive good - he and his children - the verse will also state that God, may He be blessed, swore to benefit him.",

They also said (Talmud, Arachin 29b) that if one sells his field, whether it is ancestral land or purchased land, he may not redeem it for two years, even with the permission of the buyer, as the Torah commands that it stay with the buyer for two years in the verse \"for two harvests it is sold to him.\"  That is directed to the seller; the buyer is included in the verse, \"for a number of years it is acquired\", which must be at least two.  It seems that the idea is that any sale of land must be an act of distress, and a person should not think that he can sell his land and redeem it immediately. He should know that there will be at least two years from the time of the sale that he will miss.  The Sages also said that the buyer must receive two years of harvest from the land, and if one of his years is a year of drought and disease, or a Sabbatical year, it does not count.  [A lean year, however, is counted.]  If he sold it in the Jubilee itself, the sale is invalid, and the money is returned.  If he sold just the trees, they may not be redeemed for two years, and if they are not redeemed they are not returned in the Jubilee, and it says, \"he will return to his portion\" and not to trees.  If he sold it to A and A sold to B and B to C, even if there are 100 buyers, the field returns to the original owner at the Jubilee, as it is written (Lev 27:24) \"to he who is the inheritor of the land.\"  Other details are explained in Tractate Arachin.",

This is their, may their memory be blessed, always saying in the expressions of vows (Nedarim 15a), \"Behold, it is upon me\" - or (Nedarim 13b), \"my mouth\" for speech - meaning to say that he distances that thing from him. And he has the power to bind himself with a prohibition of that thing, [just] like he has the power to forbid his possessions. And that is itself the law and the reason why [only] an oath can rest upon something of substance [as well as] something that is not of substance (Nedarim 15b), since the oath lodges upon the body of the person, meaning to say that his body is obligated to do that thing - and behold, the body has substance. However a vow only rests upon something that has substance, as it is like him placing something into the category of other things that are forbidden; meaning to say that thing x will be forbidden to him like the category of the sacrifice that is forbidden to him.

And the text of the blessing is this: Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the Universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and has separated us from the sexual prohibitions and forbade us the engagements and permitted us marriage through canopy and betrothal. Blessed are You, Lord, Who sanctified His nation, Israel, through canopy and betrothal (see Mishneh Torah, Marriage 3:23). This is is the text of the blessing over engagement that we are accustomed to say in our land. And our custom is to arrange it over a goblet full of wine, and to recite it after the act of betrothal. And they said that the explanation of this is that since the act of betrothal is dependent upon the consent of another - and that is the woman - it is not fitting to recite the blessing over the commandment before the commandment, as with other commandments. However, Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Mishneh Torah, Marriage 3:24), that if he betrothed her, and did not recite the blessing first as with the other commandments, he should not recite the blessing afterwards, as it will be a blessing in vain.",

So it is written, \"When a person proclaims an oath of valuation of people to HaShem.\" (Lev. 27:2)  Valuations are part of the system of sacred oaths, and one is therefore obligated to keep thme from the general command of \"do not profane his words\" (Num. 30:3) and \"do not hesitate to fulfill it\" (Deut. 23:22) and \"do as you speak.\" (Num 30:3)",

If the fetus is not developed enough to make the mother impure the next son is a firstborn.  In Tractate Niddah (Niddah 21a) this distinction is explained, and in Tractate Bekhorot the Sages describe which firstborn children are considered first for inheritance and which are first for the Kohen.

This is the concept of 'recalling the shofar sound' that is mentioned in connection with this day, because the shofar sound is a broken sound, and it hints to the need for each person to break his evil inclination and regret his evil deeds, as I will explain at length on the mitzvah of Shofar (Sefer HaChinukh : Mitzvah 405), with HaShem's help.  It is for this reason that the Sages did not establish the recitation of Hallel on this holiday, as they said, \"It is not proper for a person to sing songs of praise while he stands in judgement.\"  Rabbi Abahu also said in the final chapter of Rosh HaShanna (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 32b), \"The ministering angels said the HaShem, 'why do the people of Israel not say Hallel on Rosh HaShanna and Yom Kippur? et al.\" as you will find there.",

Understand my son, and let it be your slogan, that the Sages said, \"One sin leads to another, and one mitzvah leads to another\" (Avot 4:2).  If you allow yourself to fulfill your evil fantasies even one time, you will inevitably do so many times.  If you merit to be a hero in the land and to conquer your evil inclination and close your eyes to the evil sights even one time, it will be easier for you to do so many times.

The rest of the tribe serves to assist, as the verse says, \"And HaShem spoke to Aharon saying, 'You, your sons, and your patriarchal lineage shall bear the burden of the Temple.'\"  That is, while the entire tribe must guard the Temple, this family would carry the burden of the priesthood, the primary service.  The verse continues, \"Also your brthren, the tribe of Levi, of your father, shall be brought close with you and accompany you and serve you.\"  This implies that you are primary, and not them.  It also says elsewhere, \"The levites are given to Aharon and sons.  They are truly given.\" (Num. 3:9)  Since the Kohanim are the primary doers in the service of HaShem they receive 24 gifts that are described in the verse and enumerated by the Sages (Chullin 133b): ten in the Temple, four in Jerusalem, and ten elsewhere.  The rest of the tribe that is chosen to assist Aharon is also given a life of luxury without toil through the produce tithes that they receive from all Israel.  To encourage them to contemplate that all of their portion, and that of their brethren, is due to their service of HaShem, they are commanded to give a tenth of all they receive from Israel to the 'greater ministers'.  This will remind them that someone is above them, and One is above all of them, He Who Guards All.

And for this reason, there are some of our rabbis that say in the gemara (Gittin 90a) that he can divorce her even if she burnt his cooked food - meaning to say, even for a small thing - since she is only like a valuable vessel in the home. And there are some of them that say that since this vessel is in His image and His likeness, and God granted to her - for his need and his honor - eyes to see, ears to hear and an intelligent soul, it is only fit for him to put her out and send her away from him for a large claim, and as the matter that is stated in the verse, \"because he finds something lewd about her.\" However, according to everyone, if he finds a big thing, it is fit for him to divorce her for the reason that I mentioned - since she was only created for his sake.

Neverhteless, the Talmud concludes (Talmud, Chullin 79a, according to the proper understanding) that if we conclusively know that this is the father it may not be slaughtered on the same day as the offspring, because the law follows Rabbi Yehuda.  Rabbi Yehuda seems to be uncertain if we concern ourselves with the male parentage, because he says that a mule may not be mated with a horse or a donkey, but only with another mule.  If he truly believed that the male parentage is not followed he would not have said that, instead he would have said the mule may be mated with another mule that shares a maternal type.  Instead he is in doubt, and when he said that we do not concern ourselves with paternity he meant that we cannot be lenient on that basis, but we must be strict when relevant.   In any place that a stringency will result from ignoring paternity, then we ignore it, because it is a case of doubt so we must be strict in every place.

And the explanation of the matter is [that it is] because the verse forbids <i>shaatnez</i> with an expression of wearing, meaning to say in the way of wearing is it forbidden and not in another way. And for this reason our teacher, God protect him, permitted us to put hats that are made from felt on our head to guard against the sun, since they are also very hard. And therefore, even though they have a forbidden mixture in them, they permitted them, as it is not the way of wearing something so hard. And there is one who wants to be stringent upon himself with this, and they did not protest against him. And for this reason that it is the way of wearing that the Torah forbade, they also permitted the sellers of cloth to sell according to their way (to put the cloth on top of themselves) but only when they do not have any intention at all to warm up from it. And nonetheless, the modest and good wholesalers extend clothes from forbidden mixtures on a stick behind them, so that they not touch them.

One who did not redeem his son at the proper time, that is after 30 days, if he dies before he is redeemed he has failed to fulfill this mitzvah, and woe unto him for he carries his sin with his soul.  Even though there is no specified tiome for this mitzvah, as any time after 30 days have elapsed is appropriate, still the wise of heart will pursue mitzvot and perform the mitzvah at the first available moment.

If there is persecution, even in private and even for his benefit, even for a trivial mitzvah he should be killed. A trivial mitzvah is like what TOBM said, \"even a shoe lace,\" which means a Jew should not wear his shoes in the idolatrous fashion, because he should not look like an idolater.  This is a subcategory of idolatry, anything that is prohibited by a unique prohibition is the field of idolatry, like that TOBM said (Talmud, Pesachim 25a), \"One who is in peril may be healed by anything except for asheira wood.\"  The Yerushalmi said on this (Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 14:4) that is not only if the doctor says, \"bring me those asheira branches\" which would then seem like deifying it.  It even applies is he says, \"bring some leaves of that tree\" and they can only find the asheira, martyrdom is still required.  Even though when he is healed in this case it is not truly idolatry, for he did not worship it, it is still prohibited because of the prohibition of \"keep nothing of the banned in your hand\" (Deuteronomy 13:18), which is a unique prohibition in the category of idolatry.

If a person says to his fellow, \"lend me a manah [=100 zuz]\" and the other responds, \"I have no manah, but I have a manah worth of wheat.\"  If he then gives him the wheat and buys them back for 90, this would certainly be legal, but the Sages forbade it because it allows for a ruse of interest.  It is apparent that this is like usury, as this one gave 90 but will receive 100 in return, but if it was already done the court would extract the full 100, as this is not even the 'dust of interest'; it is only prohibited as a safeguard.  Also, if one had a field as collateral he may not rent it to its owner as this is also a ruse.  Similar cases are described in the Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 68a).  Even though these are only forbidden as ruses, some other activities are permitted even though they seem like genuine usury.  The Sages permitted them because they could not lead to other transgressions.  For example, a person may sell debt at a discount, and he may also pay an agent to procure a loan from another Jew on his behalf.  The general principle is that the Torah only forbade interest that goes from the hand of the borrower to the lender.  This is because the Torah usually describes the dominant case and leaves out the details, and as the standard case is funds transferring directly from the borrower to the lender this is the command of the Torah.  Even though all this is true, any moral person should stay as far from any kind of usury ruses as possible.  Anyone who pursues vehicles to extract interest payments from another Jew will eventually see his fortune dwindle, as the Sages said, \"Anyone who deals in interest shrinks his portfolio.\"  (Talmud, Bava Metzia 71a)  They also said, \"A peruta of interest causes a loss of storehouses full of cash.\" (Talmud, Bava Metzia 75b)  Many more details are explained in the fifth chapter of Bava Metziah.",

If he loaned with a rabbinic form of 'the dust of interest' he has transgressed a rabbinic edict, but the money cannot be retrieved by the court.  If the borrower seized the interest amount from the lender we do not take it back from him.  If the interest was in the category of the ruse ,we obviously don't force the lender to return it and we even retrieve the money from the borrower if he seized it, as this was the arrangement that they agreed to.

If he puts out a bad name about her and she is [now] an adult, even though he brings witnesses that she was unfaithful to him, [if they testified about the time] when she was a maiden (before full legal adulthood), behold, he is exempt from lashes and from the fine.

The law is that a stolen Sukka is valid, as land cannot be stolen.  Even if one stole wood and made a Sukka out of them it is valid, as the Sages passed an edict that he is only repsobsible to pay for the wood.

It emerges that a person should be mindful of what he orders his Hebrew slave to perform, and this is part of the principle that the Sages said, \"one who acquires a Hebrew slave has acquired a master for himself.\" (Talmud, Kiddushin 22a) Nevertheless, the verse says that he will be a \"laborer and a worker with you,\" which implies that he may be ordered to perform all customary forms of work.  In general a free laborer is not employed for degrading work, nor is a migrant worker, who stays with the master and performs his work at will.  Therefor the Torah said that he should be like a worker, because these men, even though they do work, are usually not employed in slave-style labor.

And in this way exactly did they, may their memory be blessed, expound the annulment of the oath of God, may He be blessed: They wanted to say that He is 'graceful and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness,' and atones for sins, even though their sins are great and strong to the point that if a man sinned to another so much, [the one offended] would swear never to forgive [the other]. And upon this approach, they, may their memory be blessed, said that Moshe annulled it; meaning to say that it was the merit of Moshe's good prayer that caused God, may He be blessed - who is the Listener to prayer - to have forgiven their sin. And this is [why] you will not find that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed,  expound about the matter of the annulment of an oath of His, may He be blessed, except with a great sin - such that every listener will [understand] that it not given to atonement; meaning to say it is fitting to swear about it that it should not be atoned.

And what is its time? A day wage-worker collects the whole night; and about this is it stated, (Leviticus 19:13), \"the wages of a laborer shall not remain with you until morning.\" And a night wage-worker collects the whole day; and about this is it stated, \"You must pay him his wages on the same day.\" And a day hourly wage-worker collects the whole day and a night hourly wage-worker collects the whole night. A monthly wage-worker, a weekly wage-worker, a yearly wage-worker, a seven-year wage worker - [if] he leaves during the day, he is paid [that] whole day, [and if] he leaves during the night, he is paid [that] whole night.

But if he did not return the work to its owners, [the employer] does not transgress [by delaying payment].

There is also a benefit for the owner of the field, that he acquires through this a goodly soul; for truly through the trait of generosity and a blessed soul that does not place its heart upon the forgotten sheaf and leaves it to the destitute - on those with such a soul - does the blessing of God descend forever.",

Therefore, He, blessed be He, did command to render ownerless all that the land produces in this year, in addition to resting during it (i.e. during the year), so that a person will remember that the land which produces fruits for him every year does so not by its might and virtue, for there is a master over it and over its master, and when He wishes He commands him (i.e. the master of the land) to render them (i.e. the fruit) ownerless. And there is another benefit in this matter, to acquire the trait of letting go (i.e. of one's possessions), for there is no one more generous than he who gives without hope for recompense. And there is another benefit, the outcome of this is that a person will add to his trust in God, may He be blessed, since anyone who finds it in his heart to give and abandon to the world all of the produce of his lands and his ancestral inheritance for an entire year, and educates through this himself and his family for all of his days, will never have the trait of stinginess overcome him too much nor will he have a deficient amount of trust.",

But mercy for Him is from His simple desire - that His wisdom loves to have mercy, because it is a good trait, and all good traits are found with Him. And they said [that] in His commanding us about this, it was not by force of the trait of mercy that He commanded us in the thing, as behold, He permitted their slaughter, since all the species are created for the needs of man.

As since it is written, \"Do not eat [...] but only roasted with fire,\" why do I [need] \"raw and boiled?\" It is understood from it that we should give lashes for each one of the components. And he, may he blessed, said that the count is like this with all of the commandments - that any that are specified individually, which are two separate things, are each counted in the count of the commandments. [An] example is this of 'uncooked and boiled'; and so [too], 'the wage and the price'; and 'leaven and honey,' and others [besides them].",

And that which is similar [is also prohibited]; since this is the reason that [Onkelos] explained Scripture as regarding weapons - because they are vessels that are completely unique to men, as it is not the way of a woman in the world to go out with weapons. But the same is true, that it is forbidden from the Torah, for them to go out with clothes that it is the custom of the men of that place to use - for example, that she should place a turban on her head or other vessels that are unique to a man (see Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 22:5).",

And even if he muzzled it with [his] voice, he is lashed - for example, [if] he prevents the cow from eating with the call of his rebukes. As the twisting of the lips in this is considered a major act, to give him lashes upon it, as is apparent from Sanhedrin 65b. (And it is a wonder: what is different here from other places where we do not lash for a negative commandment that has no [true] act.) And one who rents an animal and muzzles it is lashed and repays the owners - four kav-measures for a cow and three kav-measures for a donkey.",

And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 14a) that only when he makes the vow with a thing that is vowed (that changes status) does his vow stand, and not in another way. As if he says, \"Thing x is forbidden to me like a sacrifice,\" as we have said; in this [way], the vow will stand (Nedarim 13a). But if he says, \"like the meat of a pig,\" this is not a vow; as the Torah stated (Numbers 30:3), \"If he vows a vow,\" meaning to say, \"if he vows with something that is vowed.\" And so, one who forbids something to his fellow or to himself like the matters of a sacrifice that God, may He be blessed, forbade, is like this matter (like something vowed); since it is as if he said [that] thing x will be forbidden to him or to his friend, [just] like God, may He blessed, forbade us the matters of a sacrifice. And this matter that we have the power to forbid the permissible is because the Torah taught us this, from that which is written (Numbers 30:3), \"If [...] he creates a prohibition [...], he may not break his word.\"",

And when three pilgrim holidays have passed by him and he has [still] not fulfilled his word, he has transgressed the negative commandment of 'do  not delay,' and [it is] as we will write in this Order with God's help (Sefer HaChinukh 574). And in our day, one who vows charity and does not pay it to the beadles or the poor - if there are some there - on the day that he vows it, he has negated this positive commandment and also transgressed 'do not delay,' immediately - according to the opinion of a few commentators.

And since he divorced her, she is not fitting to bring her back any more - therefore he is lashed. And know that if he was an Israelite and he divorced the one he raped and she died before he could take her back or she married another [man], that behold, since he can no longer fulfill the positive commandment, he is lashed in any event. And even though he did not truly negate the negative commandment with his [own] hands, but rather it was negated by [another] cause, he is obligated in [getting] lashes - since he is no longer able to fulfill the positive commandment.

And that which it stated, \"in Our image,\" about the intellectual side of man is because all intellect is in Him, blessed be He. But there is no other comparison between Him, Blessed be he, and any creature (that preceded its matter) of His creatures, God forbid.

And we remember once a week, every week, that the universe was created in six distinct days, that nothing was created on the seventh day, and that different [types of creations] were brought into being each day. [All of this confirms the Torah's philosophical idea of God's] Simple (Single) Will, which differs from the philosophers' view, that disgusts us in their idea regarding this matter that [alongside] the Blessed One['s existence] was everything. And through our rest on the seventh day we are reminded of the universe's creation; because, when everyone simultaneously  rests once a week, curious people will ask what is the point of this rest?  And the answer will be \"because [in] six days God created, etc.\" (Exodus 31:17). [And through that answer], everyone will be  strengthened in the true faith. And in addition to remembering the universe's creation, there is in [Shabbat] also a remembering of the miracle of [the Exodus from] Egypt - that we were slaves there and we were not able to rest whenever we desired to rest, and God saved us from their hands and commanded us to rest on the seventh day (Shabbat). Therefore, the second root is mentioned in Deuteronomy (lit. the repetition of the Torah), as it states in the [context of] the commandment of Shabbat \"And you should remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, etc. therefore the Lord, your God, commanded you to [observe] (lit. make) the day of Shabbat\" (Deuteronomy 5:15).",

And this matter is that anyone who takes a vessel in which we make life-sustaining food as surety transgresses a negative commandment, as we shall explain; and one who takes many vessels - all of with which we make life-sustaining food - as surety is liable for each and every vessel; for example, if he takes as surety a vessel for grinding and a vessel for bread and a vessel for kneading. And this is like one who takes in pawn the garment of Reuven's widow and the garment of Shimon's widow and the garment of Levi's widow - that he transgresses for each and every garment. However the law in question is about one who takes in pawn two vessels - and he makes life-sustaining food with all of them - but the cannot suffice with (use) one without the other, and [so maybe] he should [only] be liable for one vessel; or perhaps we should say that since they are two vessels, he should be liable for each and every one by itself. And they elucidated for us that he is liable for two vessels, and even though the work is done through the gathering of both of them - for example, a handmill and an upper millstone, with which one cannot grind without the other. Such that if he takes in pawn a handmill and an upper millstone, it will be like he takes in pawn a vessel for the dough and a slaughtering knife - and they are two vessels, each of which has its [own] work.

And this is the language of Sifrei about this matter that I have elucidated to you - they said, 'Just like a handmill and an upper millstone are two distinct vessels but serve for one work and  we make liable for this on its own and for this on it own; so too all two vessels that serve for one work, one is  liable for this on its own and for this on it own.'

Also, if after he dies the court affirms his statements, they have similarly negated this mitzvah, in addition to transgressing the negative commandment of perverting justice.

He established this difference in the 'golden fountain,' because this is the reason for the existence of people, besides being a completion of the physical body as we mentioned. God wanted to complete his plan with the chosen nation.

        "2_, 385_Mitzvah, 6_Paragraph": "If one has a linen garment he should place linen tzitzit in it, for the law does not follow the view of Beit Shammai who taught (Menachot 40a) that linen garments are exempted from tzitzit.  They held that since a linen garment could never have t'chelet on it because of sha'atnez (as t'chelet must always be wool for the dye to absorb properly, which is the Torah's intention), even white linen strings are not put on.  This is what they meant when they said that Beit Shammai exempts linen in tzitzit, but the law does not follow them.  They did not derive laws from adjacent verses, but we follow Beit Hillel who did, and they therfore held that there is no problem of sh'atnez in tzitzit, as the Torah says, “Do not wear sha'atnez.  Make fringes for yourself” (Deut 22:11).  This implies that you may make your tzitzit from ?sha'atnez, and Beit Hille therefore believed that linen garments are obligated in tzitzit, and the law follwos them.  Still, we do not put t'chelet on a linen garment due to a concern about indigo, that is, lest a non-t'chelet dye be used and then it would be sha'atnez without the performance of a mitzvah.  The Talmud asked why it is not enough for the white strings to be the fulfillment of the mitzvah?  That is, even if it is indigo the sha'atnez problem is still surmounted by the white strings, as it is acceptable to use tzitzit that are sha'atnez!  They answered that Beit Hillel permitted sha'atnez in tzitzit on the strength of the verse only in cases where there are no alternatives, e.g. placing wool t'chelt in a linen garment, which is necessarily a combination of wool and linen.  In such cases Beit Hillel rely on the verse and obligated the use of t'chelet in a linen garment.  If however, there are other options, such as a case where one wishes to use white strings without t'chelet in a linen garment, it is not acceptable to use wool on the strength of the verse, as those white strings can be made of linen.  This follow the principle of Reish Lakish who said that in any case where it is possible to maintain both the positive and negative commandments it is ideal, an only otherwise do we say that the positive commandment supersedes the negative.  In this case it is possible to  maintain both commandments, for if you do not wish to place t'chelet with the white, linen suffices, and if you elect to use wool you have violated the law of sha'atnez and nothing else.  Because there are many interpretations of this discussion I have spent some time on it, and from what I found in my trap I have set the table for you.  If you merit you will understand the truth, and if you perhaps find valid reason to challenge my words in this matter my son you should not mind the honor of your father, and I will then read your destruction of the building.",

The same is not true of coins, which can neither be bartered for or with, because people always think about the face value and it may be devalued by governmental action.  Thus, it is not of constant predictable value and people do not have faith to acquire with it, and it cannot be used for barter.

Five double knots are tied, and between each knot three spaces are left, and between the final knot four spaces, so that there are a total of thirteen spaces.  The strings are made long so that at least two thirds of the length are free hanging.  This is the ideal fulfillment of the mitzvah.

And this is also a trunk from the root mentioned, for it is not honorable for the sons of kings and the advisers of the land to drag the bones and break them like dogs. It is not a proper thing to do this, except for the impoverished among the people and the starving. And therefore, as we began to become the chosen of all nations, \"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\" (Exodus 19:6), and in each and every year at that time, it is proper for us to do acts that show in us the great stature which we achieved at that hour. And in the act and reenactment that we do, this thing is placed in our souls for eternity. My son, do not think to pounce upon my words and say why would God, may He be blessed, command us to do all of these commandments to commemorate that miracle; would we not remember it with one commemoration, [such that] it not be forgotten from the mouth of our offspring? You must know, that it is not from wisdom that you would [question] me about this, and it is your youthful thoughts that leads you to this. And now, my son, \"If you have understanding\" (Job 34:16), \"incline your ear and hear\" (Proverbs 22:17), and I will teach you to benefit from Torah and the commandments. You must know, that a man is acted upon according to his actions; and his heart and all his thoughts always follow after the actions that he does - whether good or bad. And even he who in his heart is a complete sinner and all the desires of his heart are for only evil, if his spirit shall be enlightened and he will put his efforts and actions to persist in Torah and commandments, even if not for the sake of Heaven, he shall immediately incline towards the good. And from that which is not for its own sake comes that which is for its own sake [as opposed to personal gain], for the hearts are drawn after the actions. And even if a man is perfectly righteous and his heart is straight and innocent, desiring of Torah and the commandments, if he shall constantly deal with improper things, you could compare it to someone who was forced by the king to work a wicked craft; if he constantly works in that wicked craft, eventually from his righteousness he shall have become completely evil, for it is known and true that every man is acted upon according to his actions, as we have said. And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said about this (Makkot 23b), \"God wanted to grant merits to Israel, therefore he gave them many laws and commandments,\" to occupy all of our thoughts and all our deeds, to benefit us at our end [i.e. in the world to come]. Because from the good actions we are acted upon to be good and we merit eternal life. And the Sages hinted at this (Menachot 43b) with their statement that anyone who has a mezuzah on his door, tsitsit on his garment and tefillin on his head is promised that he shall not sin - for these are constant commandments, and [so] he is constantly acted upon by them.",

And there are many such statements in their words - and in the Torah and in Scripture very many. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, mentioned some of them. But [as far] those homiletic teachings (<i>aggadot</i>) with which the teacher was challenged, according to [Ramban's] opinion, they are about a different matter: that they wanted to say that there is no benefit in the commandments to the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself, may He be blessed. Rather, the benefit is for the person, himself, to deter him from harm or a bad belief or an ugly trait or to remember wonders of the Creator, may He be blessed, [so as] to remember God. And this is [what was meant by] \"to refine them with them\" - that they should be like refined silver. As the action of the one who refines silver is not without explanation, but [rather] to remove all the dross. So too are the commandments to remove from him any bad belief and to inform him of the truth and to always remind him. And the language of the <i>aggadah</i> itself in Yilamdenu in the section, 'This is the animal ' (Midrash Tanchuma, Shmini 8): \"And for what would the Holy One, blessed be He, care if one  slaughters a beast and eats or stabs [it] and eats? Does it help Him or hurt Him at all?  Or what would He care whether one would eat pure foods or eat carcasses? 'And if you have been wise, you have been wise for yourself.' Behold, the commandments were only given to refine the creatures with them, as it states (Psalms 12:7), 'The words of the Lord are pure words; 'The word of the Lord is refined' (Psalms 18:31). Why? So that it will a shield for you.\"",

If he borrowed and returned the money, and then sent gifts in recognition of the fact that his money was idle, this is late interest.  Some authorities also said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Creditor and Debtor 6:7) that if one lends money to his fellow with land that constantly produces value (like a courtyard, bathhouse or market stall), if it is done withut a discount it is genuine usury, and if there si a discount it is 'dust of usury'.  But if the loan is made with the land that does not constantly produce value (like a field or vineyard, as sometimes the expense involved exceeds the revenues) without a discount it is not usury, and with a discount it is permitted.  Other authorities say that the Sages even prohibited this latter case, and the only permissible form of collateral is the Syrian style, in which they would write, \"at the end of these years the land will transfer without funds.\"  In truth it seemed from the Talmud to our teachers (HaShem should keep them) according to the best explanations, that any collateral that is made with a discount, whether it is a house or bathhouse that produces profits, or a field or vineyard, it is all permitted with a discount.  This is the custom in our regions based on their words, and one who is concerned for the view of the great sages who were strict in this matter will be blessed from heaven. ...",

But with the labor of others - even though he is warned about them with a negative commandment - he is not liable for them; [not] even with lashes, as lashes are never for the act of others. And from the language of Rambam, may his memory be blessed, (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sabbath 20:1) it is implied that he holds that this prohibition of \"do not perform any labor, you [...] and your animal,\" comes upon letting an animal work (<i>mechamer</i>) while being behind it - for example, that he is using it to plow. As, according to his opinion, letting an animal work by itself is only a prohibition [embedded] in a positive commandment. And hence, according to his opinion, they said in the Gemara (Shabbat 154a) that this negative commandment of letting your animals do work is a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court - meaning to say, that a man is killed for it, and [so] there are no lashes for it. But Ramban, may his memory be blessed, (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Shorashim 14) wrangles with him greatly on this explanation, and says that this negative commandment of letting your animals do work is only about walking behind his animal laden with his load, while the man does not do any act with his hands. And therefore neither lashes nor the death penalty would ever come to him; and it is as that which has been established for us, we do not administer lashes for any negative commandment that does not have an act. [And it is] like they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Shabbat 154b), \"'You [...] and your animal' - let it write, 'do not perform labor and your animal'; why do I need 'you?' [To tell you] that when he performs labor, he is liable, but for the labor of his animal he is not liable.\" Rather, he is [just] warned about it with a negative commandment, like with the labor of his young child and his Canaanite slave. But for his own actual labor - for that there was no reason to say that he is liable, as behold, his punishment is explicit (Exodus 34:2), \"any one who performs labor on it shall die.\" And according to the opinion of Ramban, may his memory be blessed, the explanation of that which they said in the Gemara about the negative commandment of letting your animal do work, that it is a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court, is that since it also includes the other [types of] labor which [come] with a warning of a death penalty from the court - even though with letting your animal work there is certainly only a negative commandment, as there is also not [even] lashes with it - nonetheless, this negative commandment is [called] a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court because of those things that it includes that have death penalties of the court. And similar to this did they, may their memory be blessed, say in the first chapter of Eruvin 17b about the negative commandment of \"let no man leave his place\": Since it also includes carrying out from one domain to another - like the teaching that they expounded, [read, do not go out (<i>yetseh</i>), as] do not carry out (<i>yotsee</i>) - that it is from now a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court in some of its matters. And since it is so, we can say that we do not administer lashes for it, in all of its matters.

And so we find that Chananiah ben Achai, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Akiva ben Yosef did so in this regard (Berakhot 23a). But without these conditions, no one of Israel is permitted to establish the months or intercalate. And if you ask: If so, how do we conduct ourselves today, when we lack ordained sages? Know that thus we have received [our calendar], since Rabbi Hillel the Prince, son of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who was the greatest of his generation and ordained in the Land of Israel—he was the sage who fixed for us the calculation of intercalation, sanctified future months, and intercalated  future [months into] years until the coming of Eliyahu (i.e. until the Messianic Era), and it is upon this that we rely today. That which we have said all follows the opinion of Rambam. However, Ramban (in the Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 153), considers the sanctification of the month as one commandment and intercalation a separate commandment. His proofs (for dividing these into two separate commandments are) in his Book of Commandments. And so [too] the Ba'al Halakhot (considers these separate commandments). And the verse that teaches about the commandment of intercalation, that is, that we calculate the seasons in order to make the holidays in their (proper,) established times, is \"\"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time,\" (Exodus 13:10) and so, \"Observe the month of Spring,\" (Deuteronomy 16:11) as we have written.",

And one who transgresses it, and lays with an unattached women, is obligated in [getting] lashes - [both] he and her - even if the man having sexual relations with her can have betrothal with her, according to the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed. But according to Ramban, may his memory be blessed, an unattached man and an unattached woman who have sexual relations are not obligated, except if she is sexually forbidden to him, to the extent that betrothal is not effective for him with her, as we have explained. And included in this prohibition is also that it is upon a court, that knows that there is among them a woman who has abandoned herself, to eliminate this evil from among them. But they do not have an obligation in [getting] lashes, as they are not doing an act; but their punishment is very great - since the entire degradation of the generation is attributed to one who has the ability in his hand to protest and does not protest.",

Some explain (Talmud, Sukka 11b) that the Israelites made physical huts in the wilderness.

As God created His world and built it upon the foundations of the principles of nature and decreed that fire should burn and that water puts out the flame. And so too, nature requires that that if a large stone falls on the head of a man, that it will smash his brain; or that if a person falls from the top of a high roof to the ground, that he will die. And He, may He be blessed, graced the bodies of people and blew into them a living soul with a mind, to protect the body from all incidents, and [then] placed the two of them - the soul and the body - within the sphere of the [natural] elements, and [these elements] will move them and act upon them. And since God subjugated the human body to nature - as so did His wisdom require - from the angle of its being physical, He commanded him to guard [himself] from an accident.

The truth is that their dear wisdom that they would eventually come to realize was hidden and stored in the verses, and even though the primary verses are not intended to teach these laws.  The Sages also said that on a Torah level money is effective even for movable properties, but the the reason they required dragging the item was as a safeguard to avoid the seller saying \"your wheat burnt in the loft.\"  Because of this enactment the Sages said that (Baba Metzia 49b) if the object was in the buyers possession, even if he rented the space to the seller, since the domain is the buyer's and he is always attentive to the state of the object, if something should happen to the object he could recognize the risk rescue it as the seller could, in this case the sale is enacted only through money as the Torah prescribed, and not through dragging it.  Also, i the buyer rents the place that the object is located, dragging et al become ineffective.   The Sages said (Talmud, Baba Batra 85b) that just as a a person's person can acquire for him, so too his belongings can acquire for him in any place that he may leave them.  Once the object is placed inside a vessel neither can retract; it is as if it was lifted or placed inside his house.  In a place where the buyer may not place his vessel, his vessel will not acquire for him, such as the seller's property, or the public domain.  Nevertheless, the Sages said that in the seller's domain if the seller says, \"acquire with this vessel\" or even if he doesn't say it but the buyer acquired another vessel by lifting it and then placed the produce intended for purchase into the vessel, he has immediately acquired the produce.  The pleasure that the seller receives from the sale of the vessel causes him to forgive the place that it sits, and it is as if the vessel is in the buyer's domain.",

For example, [if] he would say, \"Behold, you are my wife,\" or \"my fiancee,\" or \"acquired by me\" or \"Behold, you are mine,\" or \"Behold, you are in my domain,\" or \"obligated to me,\" \"taken by me,\" \"pledged to me,\" or all that is similar to this - the understanding of which is that he is acquiring a wife - behold, she is betrothed with all of these expressions.

And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrote the opposite of this (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 198) and said that this negative commandment is not considered [a separate commandment] among the negative commandments, but rather is one of the many negative commandments [included in the prohibition] of leaven and chamets. And this prohibition (of \"All that is leavened\") is coming to teach about that which the sages, may their memory be blessed, said in the Gemara (Pesachim 28b), \"I only [know] if it became leavened on its own. From where [do I derive] if it became leavened due to another substance?

And if there is not a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i>, one who eats it is exempt [from the prohibition], but [still doing something] forbidden.

And anything that is a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i> is called a complete leavened grain product.

However we do not betroth with less than the value of a small coin - as so did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Kiddushin 3a), \"Since she does not transfer herself for less than this,\" which means to say that she does not consider such a small act to be anything. And [this is the case] even though she is acquired by a contract - [as] even though it does not have the value of a small coin, it is an important act in her eyes; as so [too] are most acquisitions in the world preformed with a contract.

And the children of the brothers with each other are called the second with the second; and the sons of the sons of the brothers are called the third with the third. And it is established for us that a third with a first is [a] proper [witness], and, all the more so, a third with a second - and it is not necessary to say that a third with a third is proper. But a second with a second is disqualified - and it is not necessary to say that a second with a first is disqualified. And according to this, the father is disqualified with his son and with his son's son; but he is proper with the son of his son's son - as he is a third with a first. But there are a few commentators (Rashbam on Bava Batra 128a:18), the opinion of which is to say that that all those that come from the 'thigh' of  a person are disqualified for him. And the brother with his sister are likewise called a first with a first, like with brothers. And in the same way that we count with males, the first generation and the second and the third, so [too] is it counted with the females (see Mishneh Torah, Testimony 13:6).",

They would separate the Kohen who would burn it for seven days in a manner similar to separation that the Kohen Gadol would endure before Yom Kippur, as we know from tradition.  Each day they would sprinkle him with existing ashes, and this would be done by someone who had never experienced impurity in his life, as the sprinkler must be pure.  You might wonder why they could not have simply used someone who had been impure and subsequently purified.  This would not have been adequate, as there was the possibility that the person may have not been purified by a pure person.  Also, any vessels that wee filled to be poured on the Kohen who would burn the heifer were all stone, so that they are not susceptible to impurity.",

And the verse in Kings that says, \"And the Kohanim brouh the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem to its place, to the Holy of Holies\" (I Kings 8:1) should also not pose a problem, because the Levites were not permitted to enter the Holy of Holies; that was limited to thew Kohanim.  The main point seems to confirm the view of Nachmanides, that the entire tribe may carry the Ark, as is clear from the verse, \"And he said to the Levites ... place the Holy Ark in the Temple that was built by Solomon son of David, the king of Israel, there is no longer a burden on your shoulders\" (II Chron. 35:3).  Furthermore, this indicates that the people would have no more need to carry the Ark form one place to another, but it does not indicate that if it were to move it would not be done by the Levites, and this is clear and obvious to all.  The Sages said (Chullin 24a) that blemishes disqualify the Kohanim but years do not - it is only the priestly duties that are not affected by age, but age does indeed disqualify for  the labor of carrying, as is the rule for the Levites.",

But if he does not perform the positive commandment and it is also impossible to perform it any longer - and for example, [if] the thing were lost or burnt - he is lashed. And the example of this is with the corner of the field, the reaping of which is a negative commandment (Sefer HaChinukh 217): And if he reaps it, he is not obligated in [getting] lashes for the reaping; as behold, he is able to fix what he distorted [by] giving it to the poor in its sheaves. And even if he threshed the wheat and ground and baked it, he can give the required amount of 'the corner' to the poor from the bread; and behold, it is still in his hand to fix [the sin] and [so,] he is not lashed. But if an accident happens that all of that wheat gets lost or it gets burnt, he is lashed; as behold, it is impossible for him to still perform the positive commandment in it. And [so,] he has already  transgressed the negative commandment and he can not fix [it]. And this is called in the gemara, 'he did not fulfill it.' And if he lost the wheat in his [own] hands or ate all of it, all the more so is he obligated in [getting] lashes for it. And this is called, 'he negated it,' in the Talmud, as he was the cause for the negating of the negative commandment in his hands - a negation that no can longer be fixed. And [about] that which they said in Makkot 16a at the end of the chapter [entitled] Elu Hen HaLokin concerning the commandment of sending away the nest regarding 'he fulfilled it and he did not fulfill it,' \"We only have this and one other [case]\" - and it is known that the other is 'the corner' - as it is concluded there, \"But rather 'this and one other' is about that,\" meaning to say, [about] 'the corner,' and the matter stays like that - their intention is not that it wants to say that only sending away the nest and 'the corner' have this law of 'he fulfilled it and he did not fulfill it.' But rather their intention was to say 'the corner' and all that have a similar law - such as fallen grapes, that which is forgotten, the fallen sheaves, and the bunchless grapes - as each one of these is a negative commandment that [involves] an act, and it is [just] as likely with them to have all that is likely with 'the corner,' regarding 'he fulfilled it and he did not fulfill it' or 'he negated it and he did not negate it.' As the verse from which we learned that in 'the corner' there is a positive commandment, is that which is written about it (Leviticus 19:10),  \"you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger.\" And with the sheaf of what is forgotten and the others mentioned, there is likewise about them, \"you shall leave them for the stranger and the orphan and the widow,\" or \"it shall go to the stranger, the orphan, and the widow.\" And take this matter and understand it, as it is a little hidden, in that the language in the gemara is somewhat unclear - in that which they said, \"We only have this and one other [case].\"",

The language of proscription [therefore] applies to them.  (This is the explanation of Nachmandies on this verse (Ramban on Leviticus 27:29)  (Even though there are many midrashic explanations, there are 70 faces to the Torah, they are all correct for the person who can understand these things.)  For this same reason the Sages said (Tamud, Arakhin 28a) that any property of the kohanim and levites is not subject to proscription, that is, even if the kohen or levi says that his field should be come proscribed, it has no effect.  He is like a person who dwells in his master's house, which is the place of blessing and kindness and good, as all his property already belongs to HaShem.

Other forms are rabbinically prohibited, which the Sages called 'the dust of usury'.  There is also another level which is lower than these first two, and this is really permitted as it is far removed from Torah level interest and is not suited for an edict, but the Sages were very strict in this matter for they saw that the Torah is very strict on it.  They passed these restrictions so that a person would not try to work around the law, and not for some other reason.  [Returning to] the three types of interest: Torah level interest describes a case in which a person says to his fellow, \"lend me a manah and I will give you a peruta every day\" or 30 perutas a month, or some other amount, until I pay you back.  Or if he says, \"lend me 100 dinar and i will pay you back 120 after a year,\" or if he lends money and takes a house or courtyard as collateral with the stipulation that he will hold the land and reap the benefit of the produce until the loan is repaid, without subtracting something from the repayment amount, this is definite usury and is prohibited from the Torah.  The general rule is explained by the Sages as \"any case of payment for the time [that the money is kept] is prohibited from the Torah\" (Talmud, Bava Metziah 63b), if the money comes from the borrower to the lender.  In this case the Sages said, \"Definite usury can be extracted by the court\" (Talmud, Bava Metziah 61b). That is, the court may seize assets from the borrower, as is the law for theft and torts.

If he did not spread out he is not flogged, but they would administer the 'rebel's beating.'  Within the context of actual idolatry there is no distinction between spread out and not spread; as soon as one bows his face to a foreign god he incurs the penalty of stoning Talmud, Horayot 4a).  The Sages also said (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Idolatry 6:7) that if he placed rugs on the stone and covered them, he may then prostate there.  They also said that the prohibition applies everywhere except the Temple, for in the Temple one may prostate one's self to HaShem on stones, as it says, \"do not place in your lands\" [which implies that] it is in your lands that you may not prostate, but you may prostate on the stone surfaces in the Temple.  This distinction may be understood based on the reason we have given, that people will suspect the prostrater of deifying the stones, and as the Temple is chosen for the service of HaShem, and it is as clear as day that the only worship that is performed there is directed to Him, there is no room for suspicion.  If, however, we follow Maimonides' rationale, that it is to distance us from what was an idolatrous practice, we should be even more careful in Temple to avoid corrupting the thoughts of the one who comes to prostrate himself to HaShem.  Still, I know that Maimonides had sound reasons for everything he said, and sometimes the inadequacies of the reader can confuse the matter.  More details are explained in Tractate Megillah.",

A man who willfully did not fulfill this mitzvah and did not bring the second Paschal offering after he was unable to offer the first, incurs Spiritual Death, as this is the view of Rabbi [Yehudah HaNasi] in the mishnah (Pesachim 93a). Rabbi Natan, Rabbi Chaninah and Rabbi Akiva ll exempt him from Spiritual Death as he was not willful in the first case.  We need not say that of he deliberately did not offer the first time,, and he was also did not bring the second offering, whether willfully or not, that he incurs Spiritual Death according to all, as he deliberately failed to offer the sacrifice to HaShem in its proper time.  This is one of two positive commandments for which the punishment is Spiritual Death, as we explained in Parashat Bo (Sefer HaChinukh : Mitzvah 5).",

And he, may his memory be blessed, wrote that this whole verse of \"You shall have no,\" is considered one negative commandment [that] warns not to concede the divinity of anything besides Him; whether he accepts it as a god - meaning to say that he says to it, \"You are my god\" - or bows down to it, or worships it in one the four forbidden worships or worships it with the worship that is particular to it. Rather, he wrote that the [prohibition] of making idols and their preservation is extrapolated from the verse (Leviticus 19:4) of \"Do not turn to idols or make molten gods for yourselves.\" And I wonder about that which Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote that there is no difference if he made it with his hand or if he commanded to make it - as behold, the one who commands is a dispatcher, and it is an established [principle] for us that a dispatcher is exempt.",

The law is that one may build his Sukka between trees and allow the trees to serve as walls, and one may build a Sukka on a wagon or a boat.  The law is that one may cover over a porch that has door-frames, whether they are onside or outside.  The roof must be made of something that is not susceptible to ritual impurity, such as the leftover stalks and bramble, but not from something that is susceptible to ritual impurity.  The law also considers a case where invalid cover is placed in the middle or on the side.  The law is that three [hand-breadths] of airspace invalidates the covering,  whether it is in the middle or on the side in a small Sukka.

And that is when they were standing in the vineyard by his will, once he knew about them, in the measure that they increased one two-hundredth from what they were at the time that he knew about them. As they, may their memory be blessed, said (Pesachim 25a), \"[If] it is planted from its start, with the taking root; [if] it has already been planted and increased, with the [further] increase.\" And, they, may their memory be blessed, explained from the tradition that this increase is one two-hundredth. And that which we say that they have not become set aside unless he wants their existence is because it is written about them, \"which you have planted\" - meaning to say, according to his will. And the explanation for this thing is elucidated in the root of forbidden mixtures on inter-breeding and of witchcraft that I have written in their place in the Order of Kedoshim (Sefer HaChinukh 244) and Mishpatim (Sefer HaChinukh 62). And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 100a), \"[If the] partition of the vineyard is breached (such that a forbidden mixture is created), we say to him, 'Fix [it].'\" [This] means to say that even though it increased one two-hundredth while he was still attempting to make the fence, it did not become set aside; since it did not become breached, and it did not stay breached, according to his will. And so [too] they, may their memory be blessed, said that one who suspends his grapevine over the produce of his fellow, behold, this one set aside his grapevine, but the produce did not become set aside (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 5:8). And for this reason, they also said that - since a person cannot set aside something that is not his - this prohibition is only [operative] by the will of the owners. And because of this, they also said that one who suspends the grapevine of his fellow over the produce of his fellow did not set aside any one of them. And for this reason, one who plants his vineyard on the seventh year did not set it aside, since in the seventh year the land is ownerless to everyone (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 5:8). And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Kilayim 5:5) that one who plants vegetables or produce in a vineyard or leaves it until it increased one two-hundredth, behold, he has set aside sixteen ells in every direction around the grapevines. And one who comes to plant vegetables or produce next to a vineyard must distance it four ells from it. And five vines is called a vineyard, and this is when they are planted in this order: two across from two and one sticking out as a tail. And they said that we distance produce and vegetables three hand-breadths from a single grapevine in every direction, because the grapevine is soft and the roots of the produce go into it and there is in this a prohibition of [forbidden] grafting. But with other trees which are hard, this concern is not there and one does not need to distance [other plantings] from them at all.

This is the opinion of some of the commentators. But there are some of them that said that we are obligated with charity, when he does not pay it immediately, even about 'do not delay.'

He appointed food and drink for him, honey and milk to bring him joy, and appointed to angels to protect him in his mother's womb, as it is written, 'with life and kindness ..' (Job 10:12).  His mother says, 'this is my firstborn, with which HaShem opened the walls of my abdomen' and his father says, 'this is my firstborn and I am commanded to redeem him, as it is written, \"and all the first born of your sons you shall redeem\" (Ex 13:13)'.  May it be Your Will that as You have allowed this father to merit to redeem this child, may he also merit to [bring him] to Torah, marriage, and good deeds.  Blessed are You HaShem, who sanctified the first born of Israel to be redeemed.\"  The father then makes two blessings, 'on the redemption of the first born\" and \"You have allowed us to live\".

But the one who is involved with what is attached - for example harvesting and reaping - only eats when he has finished his work. For example, the harvester and the reaper, would eat after they have filled the basket (see Mishneh Torah, Hiring 12:2). This is the law of the Torah, but the sages said [that] because of returning a lost object to the owner - meaning to say, that they not idle form work - that they should eat while walking form one row to another and in their returning [from the vat]. And one who idles during the time of work, and eats, transgresses a negative commandment. And about this is it stated, \"you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain,\" as we will write in this Order adjacently in its negative commandments with God's help (Sefer HaChinukh 577).

And [also] that which they said (Bava Metzia 89a) that the worker does not eat from something, the production of which is completed concerning tithing and challah-tithing. One who harvests and one who threshes and one who winnows and one who separates and one who reaps olives or grapes and one who crushes and all that is similar to these [types of] work eat from [the law of] the Torah. And the guardians of threshing floors and mounds and anything that is detached from the ground, the production of which has not been completed regarding tithes, eat from the laws of [what is practiced] in the state, but not from [the law] of the Torah, since a guardian does not do an act (see Mishneh Torah, Hiring 12:8,9). And with someone who does an act, there is no difference between when he does it with his hand or his foot or even with his shoulder - all of them eat from [the law of] the Torah. If he was involved with figs, he cannot eat grapes, as it states, \"in your neighbors' vineyard, and you may eat grapes\" - meaning to say, and not something else. And one involved in this grapevine should not eat grapes of a different vine. And it is forbidden for the worker to suck the grapes, as it states, \"and you may eat [grapes]\" - and not sucking.

Also, the betrothed bride of a priest would have been eligible to eat, but the Sages decreed that she may not until they are fully married, as is explained in the beginning of the fifth chapter of Ketubot (Talmud Ketubot 57b).  A Hebrew servant does not eat, because the Torah forbids both the perennial worker and the annual worker, as it is written, \"The boarder of a priest and his worker may not eat the sacred\" (Leviticus 22:10).  But a non-Jewish slave does eat, because he is his acquired property.  Also, if the slave acquires other slaves they may eat because of his rights. This is because implicit in the expression, \"when he acquires with an acquisition\" (Leviticus 22:11), that the acquired is acquiring.  If, however, the second-tier slave acquires a third-tier slave, that slave may not eat, because it is 'when the soul acquires,' the Torah allows only one level of acquisition.  Any priestess who had relations with someone who disqualifies from the priesthood is permanently forbidden from eating teruma (Talmud, Yebamot 65a).  The same is true for an androgynous priest, whether the androgynous individual filled the role of the male or the female in the relations.

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 23:18), \"No daughter of Israel shall be a prostitute.\" And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 355) and this is his language: \"The negative commandment about this matter has already been duplicated with a different language in the verse (Leviticus 19:29), 'Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot' - and the [following is the] language of Sifrei Kedoshim 7:3, '\"Do not desecrate your daughter\" - this is one who gives over his unattached daughter not for the sake of marriage and also [a woman] who gives herself over not for the sake of marriage.' And hear from me for what [reason] this negative commandment of strong language was duplicated, and for what was it added to (see Mishneh Torah, Virgin Maiden 2:17): That which He already made precede from His laws that one who has sexual relations with a virgin - whether it be a seduction or a rape - is not obligated any one of the punishments, except only to [give] money and to marry the woman with which he had sexual relations, as it is explained in the verse, would let it come into our thoughts that since this thing only requires the payment of money, that this law goes according to the procedure of financial law. And [if so, just] like a person has the right to give whatever of his money to his fellow and he leaves it to him to do his will with that which is [now] his; so too has [the father] the right to take the maiden with him and to give her to a man to have sexual relations with her, since that is his law that is fitting to him - meaning to say the fifty shekel-coins of silver that go the father of the maiden. And this [father] will also give her on condition that he takes from him such and such dinar-coins. And he is prevented from this [thought] and it is told to him, 'Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot.' Since that which is My law with her to only take money, however, is only when there is an incident when a man seduces or rapes [her]; but when the matter is with the consent of both of them together and it is public, there is no permissibility to this at all from any angle. And He showed the explanation for this and stated (Leviticus 19:29), 'lest the land fall into harlotry and the land be filled with depravity.' [This is] since the existence of seduction and rape is limited, but when the matter would be by choice and consent, it would spread and fill the land. And this reason is very nice and it enhances the verse. And similar to this is all that which the sages have mentioned and all that they agreed upon regarding the Torah laws.\" To here is his language, may he be blessed. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, tackled him on this (in his critique of Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 355) and said that this negative commandment of the prostitute is not coming to warn one having sexual relations without a wedding contract and betrothal, as the wedding contract is neither a commandment nor a form of acquiring a woman, at all, according to the Torah. But [rather] the main negative commandment [here] is coming to warn not to have sexual relations with a woman that is forbidden [in marriage] to the man having sexual relations in such a way that betrothal would not be effective for him with her. As they, may their memory be blessed, elucidated in the gemara (Yevamot 61a), that the harlot (<i>zonah</i>) that is mentioned in every place in the Torah is none other than a woman who an Israelite has sexual relations with, when betrothal would not be effective for him with her. And this is the harlotry that the Torah distanced and loathed forever and [here] it warned the [man] and the [woman] about it. And so too from the foundation of this matter is that the verse warns the court that they should not let a woman be abandoned among them, since her end will be to have sexual relations with men that she is forbidden to [in marriage], to the point that betrothal is not effective for them with her. As there is no doubt that a woman abandoned to the many will not be exacting afterwards 'between a piece of permissible fat and a piece of forbidden fat.' And so too does it warn the father of the girl about this explicitly in another verse; that he should not abandon her to harlotry and not to give her over to one who cannot have betrothal with her. And about this is it stated, \"Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot.\" And it is all from the reason mentioned - since she will have sexual relations with one who she is forbidden to [in marriage]; not from the reason of marriage contract and betrothal, as is the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed.", 
        "2_, 356_Mitzvah, 3_Paragraph": "From the laws of the mitzvah:  The Sages said (Talmud, Arakhin 28b) -  What distinguishes proscriptions that go to the kohen form those that go to HaShem?  The latter are sacred and are redeemed with their value, and the money then goes to the Temple treasury, and the object loses its sanctity.  The  kohen proscriptions, which are any unspecified proscription that automatically goes to the kohen, can never be redeemed, and they must be given to the kohen like termuah.  Concerning the proscriptions of the kohanim the verse says that they \"shall have no redemption.\"  They cannot be sold to another, and they cannot be redeemed [and retained] by the original owners.  Both land and movable property were given to the kohanim in the current service cycle at the time of proscription.  During the time that the original owner reatins the proscribed article it is treated as sacred for all purposes, as it is written, \"Anything proscribed is totally holy to HaShem.\" (Num 18:14)  Once it is given to the kohen it is completely ordinary, as it is written, \"All proscription in Israel shall be for you.\"  A field that is proscribed and given to a kohen never returns to the owners.  More details are explained in the eight chapter of Tractate Atrakhin and the first chapter of Tractate Nedarim.", 
        "2_, 543_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "I have written about the roots of the commandment and a few of its laws and all of its matter in its positive commandment in this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 545) - see there. And there we also spoke about this negative commandment; that it is removed by the positive commandment of \"you shall surely send away the mother.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, have already taught us in Tractate Makkot 15a in the chapter [entitled] Elu Hen HaLokin [about] all negative commandments that have a positive commandment (that reverses the result of transgressing the negative commandment), that if he fulfilled its positive commandment, he is exempt [from punishment]; [but] if he did not fulfill the positive commandment and it is [now] impossible to fulfill it, he is obligated in [getting] lashes. And as it is stated over there, \"As Rabbi Yochanan said to the teacher, 'It is taught, \"He fulfilled it and he did not fulfill it.\"'\" And that is the correct textual variant (like the variant of Rif and Ramban). And from this opinion we learned that any time the mother dies or another man has sent it away - and even though he has now not negated the positive commandment with his [own] hands, as behold, he did not kill it, but rather it died on its own; and there is no need to say if he killed the mother with his [own] hands - that he is obligated [to get lashes] according to everyone. But any time that he sent it before it died - even though he did not send it when he took it [with] the nest - he has not negated the negative commandment nor the positive commandment, since the Torah removed it with the positive commandment, and behold, he [now] fulfilled it. And [this is so] even though it is not fitting to do so, as maybe the mother will die or the sender [will die] before the sending and he will not be able to fix [it]; and also since 'enthusiasts are prompt with commandments,' and 'how good is a thing in its time.'", 
        "2_, 12_Mitzvah, 2_Paragraph": "And it is practiced by males and females at the time of the Temple, where there was a Pesach sacrifice. And the one who transgresses it and feeds a 'foreigner' from it transgresses this negative commandment. And there is no lashes for it, since it has no act (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Paschal Offering 9:7).", 
        "2_, 6_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "From the roots of this commandment are that which we have written about its slaughtering - to remember the miracle of the exodus from Egypt. And that which we have been commanded to specifically eat it roasted is because such is the way of the children of kings and ministers, to eat roasted meat - as it is a good and tasty food. And the rest of the people only eat the little meat that they [are able to acquire] boiled, in order to fill their stomachs. And it is certainly fitting for us, that eat the Pesach sacrifice [to remember] that we went out into freedom to be a nation of priests and a holy nation, to behave in a manner of freedom and lordship in its eating. [This is] besides (Guide for the Perplexed 3:46) that the eating of roast indicates the haste [with] which they left Egypt and could not delay, that it should cook in a pot.", 
        "2_, 39_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "From the roots of this commandment is that we should fix into our souls from the day that we make [the altar], that [through] it afterwards will come forgiveness of iniquity, blessing and peace. And hence to remember this thing, we were commanded to not do anything upon it with tools that are fit for destruction - and that is [those made from] iron that cuts and is constantly ready to spill blood. And I have already prefaced for you at the beginning, that man is acted upon according to his actions, and [that] his thoughts always follow his deeds. Therefore, it is fitting for us to do symbolic actions, according to the intention of the things. And when the fool who is [too] rushed hears these things, he will not know nor understand [them].", 
        "2_, 602_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "About the roots of this commandment are to put into our hearts that anyone who distresses Israel is despised in front of God, blessed be He; and that according to his evil and his great deceptive damage, will be his downfall and bad [occurrences], as you find with Amalek: That due to [the fact that] he committed a great evil to Israel - that he began to harm them - blessed be He, commanded us to 'destroy his memory from the earth' and root it out after him, until its end (see Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 189)", 
        "2_, 43_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "From the roots of this commandments is that which we have written about [the previous commandment of] designation (Sefer HaChinukh 43). And its details are also there in Kiddushin.", 
        "2_, 392_Mitzvah, 0_Paragraph": "It is forbidden to redeem the first born of out kosher cattle.  Since the Torah had commanded that the first born donkey be redeemed on might have assumed that the kosher cattle should also be redeemed with another animal.  Therefore we arrive at this prohibition, that they never be redeemed.  Even is one trangressed and attempted to redeem it, it is not redeemed.  On this the verse says, \"However, the first born of your ox, sheep, or goat should not be redeemed.  They are sacred.\" (Num. 18:17)  The Torah specified the three types of kosher cattle that are subject to this command, as the seven varieties of wild animal are not included, as I explained in Parashat Bo. (Sefer HaChinukh 17) ", 
        "2_, 338_Mitzvah, 3_Paragraph": "Nachmanides explicitly wrote that (commentary on Makkot, 3b) that if one stipulates that the field will  not return in the Jubilee the condition doe not stand and the field does return.  The same is not true for the Sabbatical year, where if one loans on the condition that it will not be cancelled by the Sabbatical the condition does stand, as this relates to money.  He explained that regarding the cancellation of debts the Torah only prohiibitied the activity of the lender, as it says \"Every creditor should cancel all that his fellow owes him\" (Deut. 15:2).  The borrower, however, retains the right to repay if he so desires.  In the context of the Jubilee both the seller and the buyer are included, as we have written, the Torah says \"shall not be sold\" to both of them, as the land belongs to HaShem, and no person has the right to sell it permanently.  Therefore, neither has the authority to forgive the rule, and land is forcibly returned to the ancestral owner, even if they make a thousand conditions that it should not return.  This is a good reason.",

        "2_, 556_Mitzvah, 1_Paragraph": "About the roots of this commandment are [that] it is in order to restrain the villains from this evil deed, and that the daughters of Israel should not be as if abandoned. Since if the rapist thinks he can fill his desire with her and [just] walk away, it will be light in his eyes to do so many times. But if he has in mind that she will be tied to him and he will be [held] responsible for the obligation of [her] sustenance, clothing and appointed times, all of his days; and that even if he gets sick of her, he will never have the option of divorcing her; and that he he will have to give to her father fifty silver [shekel-coins] immediately - he will truly suppress his [evil] impulse and prevent himself from doing this villainy that comes with such a penalty. And there is also in this a little comfort for this poor embarrassed woman in that she will stay with him forever, lest another man would embarrass her with this evil thing that happened to her. 'And the ordinances of the Lord are straight, they rejoice the heart.'", 
        "2_, 551_Mitzvah, 3_Paragraph": "From the laws of the commandment are that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 2a), that the one who betroths with money or with monetary value, is required that there be the value of a small coin in it - since, anything that is less than the value of a small coin is not money and a woman is not acquired by it. And he says to her, \"Behold, you are betrothed to me with this money or with this monetary value,\" or \"Behold, you are engaged to me,\" or \"Behold, you are a wife to me.\" And all of Israel is already accustomed to saying, \"Behold, you are betrothed to me with this thing like the law of Moshe and Israel.\" And he gives it to her in front of witnesses. And if there are no witnesses there - and even if they both, the man and the woman, say that he betrothed her - it is not a betrothal (Kiddushin 65a). And it is the man that must say these words - the understanding of which is that he acquired her - and give her the money (see Mishneh Torah, Marriage 3:1, 7). But if she gives anything to him and said, \"Behold, I am betrothed to you\" or any other expression of transferal, she is not betrothed. And so [too], if she gave [it] to him and he said [the betrothal declaration]. But if he gave [it] and she said [the declaration], behold, she is betrothed [from] a doubt [about the actual law] (Kiddushin 6b). ",

He should also recognize that just as this slave was sold because of his desperation, the same could happen to him, or to one of his sons (if they should be sinful), and through honoring his slave he will certainly recognize this, and through this though he will avoid sin.  Another purpose if to instill the values of kindness and compassion, and to distance us from the evil trait of cruelty, and through establishing good characters we will receive goodness, as HaShem wishes to bestow His blessings on His creations, as we have said many times before.

One who transgresses and does not [sanctify the new month or intercalate the month], if he be a sage for whom it is appropriate, has nullified a positive commandment, and his punishment is very great since he causes the ruining of the holidays. And now, when in our sins we no longer have intercalation by ordained [scholars], our calculation relies on the accepted calculation from Rabbi Hillel, as we have said. "
