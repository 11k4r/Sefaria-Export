        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 3_Seif": "This is the mitzvah of \"Santifying G‑d's Name,\" in which all Jews are obligated. This means that allow ourselves to be killed by a tyrant for love of G‑d (exalted be He) and belief in His Oneness. [This is] similar to the actions of Chanaya, Mishael, and Azaryah in the days of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who forced people to bow down to a statue, and everyone — including Jews — bowed down. There was nobody there to sanctify G‑d's Name, and this was a tremendous shame to the Jewish people. Everyone did not fulfill this mitzvah, and there was nobody to fulfill it; everyone was afraid.", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 4_Seif": "This commandment is obligatory only in such an awesome setting, when all inhabitants of the world were terrified, and it was then necessary to spread and announce His Unity.2", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 1_Seif": "The biblical source of this commandment is G‑d's statement1, \"Sanctify Me amidst the Jewish people.\"", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 2_Mitzvah, 5_Seif": "The meaning of this Sifri: Avraham, as a result of his deep understanding of G‑d, acquired love for G‑d, as the verse testifies, \"Avraham, who loved Me\"5. This powerful love therefore caused him to call out to all mankind to believe in G‑d. So too, you shall love Him to the extent that you draw others to Him.", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 5_Seif": "But G‑d had already promised through His prophet Isaiah that the Jewish people would not be completely disgraced on that difficult occasion; and that a few young men3 would be present who would not be afraid of death, and would give up their lives and publicize faith in G‑d, sanctifying G‑d's Name in public as we have been commanded through Moses. This promise is in the verse4, \"Now, Jacob will not be afraid, nor will his face turn white; for he will see in his midst his children, the work of My hands. They will sanctify My Name, the Holy One of Jacob, and strengthen the G‑d of Israel.\"", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 2_Mitzvah, 1_Seif": "[We can see that meditation is the way to create this feeling of love1 from] the Sifri: \"From the statement, 'You shall love G‑d your Lord'2, can I know how to love G‑d? The Torah therefore says, 'and these words which I command you today shall be upon your heart'3; i.e. that through this [meditation about His commandments] you will understand the nature of 'the One Who spoke, and thereby brought the world into being.' \"", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 0_Seif": "The 9th mitzvah is that we are commanded to sanctify G‑d's Name.", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 9_Seif": "The details of this commandment have been explained in the 7th chapter of the tractate Sanhedrin.", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 154_Mitzvah, 0_Seif": "The 155th Positive Mitzvah is that God commanded us to sanctify the Sabbath and to make verbal declarations when it enters and goes out.  We recall at these times the Exodus from Egypt...", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 205_Mitzvah, 0_Seif": "My mercy and love for my brother [my fellow Jew] should be exactly like the mercy and love I have for myself; [specifically in regards to] his money, physical welfare, and everything that will ever be in his possession or he will want. And, everything that I wish for myself, I should desire for him. [Conversely,] anything that I would hate for myself or for anyone who associates with me, I should find hateful to him in the exact same fashion. This is what the Torah stated: “… and you shall love your neighbor as yourself", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 2_Mitzvah, 3_Seif": "Our Sages also said that this mitzvah includes calling out to all mankind to serve G‑d (exalted be He) and to believe in Him. This is because when you love a person, for example, you praise him and call out to others to draw close to him. So too, if you truly love G‑d — through your understanding and realization of His true existence — you will certainly spread this true knowledge that you know to the ignorant and the foolish.", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 2_Mitzvah, 0_Seif": "The 3rd mitzva is that we are commanded to love G‑d (exalted be He), i.e. to meditate upon and closely examine His mitzvos, His commandments, and His works, in order to understand Him; and through this understanding to achieve a feeling of ecstasy. This is the goal of the commandment to love G‑d. [We can see that meditation is the way to create this feeling of love1 from] the Sifri: \"From the statement, 'You shall love G‑d your Lord'2, can I know how to love G‑d? The Torah therefore says, 'and these words which I command you today shall be upon your heart'3; i.e. that through this [meditation about His commandments] you will understand the nature of 'the One Who spoke, and thereby brought the world into being.' \"From this it is clear that meditation will lead to understanding, and then a feeling of enjoyment and love will follow automatically [since the second verse explains the way to reach the goal of the previous verse.]Our Sages also said that this mitzvah includes calling out to all mankind to serve G‑d (exalted be He) and to believe in Him.

        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 8_Seif": "They bring proof that this is counted among the mitzvos from the verse, \"Sanctify Me amidst the Jewish people.\"", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 7_Seif": "In the end of tractate Sanhedrin, they ask, \"Is a non-Jew commanded to sanctify G‑d's Name or not? Here is a statement which proves it: 'The seven commandments of the non-Jews.' If you include this one [i.e. to sanctify G‑d's Name], there would be eight!\" From this we see that, for Jews, [sanctification of G‑d's Name] counts as a mitzvah.", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 8_Mitzvah, 2_Seif": "This mitzvah requires us to publicize the true religion to the masses. This must be done without fear of retribution, to the extent that even if a powerful tyrant tries to force us to deny G‑d (exalted be He), we may not obey him. We must rather unquestioningly submit to death, not even allowing him to think that we have denied G‑d (exalted be He) [by outwardly denying Him], even if we still maintain belief in Him in our hearts.",

This is what the Torah said \"make for me a Temple.\"", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 169_Mitzvah, 0_Seif": "This commandment is to hear the sound of the shofar on the first day of Tishrei, as He, the prasied One said, \"A day of [shofar] blasts it should be for you\". The details of this Mitzvah are expounded in tractate Rosh Hashana. Women are not required to fulfill this Mitzvah.",

        "3_Positive Commandments, 108_Mitzvah, 0_Seif": "And our intention in writing that immersion is a positive commandment is not that it is a commandment upon everyone impure to become purified regardless, like anyone who is covered by a cloak must make fringes (tsisit), and so [too,] all who have a roof are obligated to make a parapet for it. [Rather,] the matter is that the Torah informed us that one who wants to become pure from his impurity will not have a possibility to do this without immersion in water. And [so] it commanded us to accept the matter and to do it like this when we want to become pure. But if one wants to stay in in his impurity and not to enter the encampment of the Divine Presence for a long time, the option is in his hand.\" ", 
        "3_Positive Commandments, 9_Mitzvah, 0_Seif": "That which He commanded us to read Shema in the evening and morning and he said [in the torah] \"and you shall speak of them\". And the laws of this of this mitzvah were already explained in tractate Berakhot (page 21) and there it explains that reading the Shema is a biblical commandment. And in the Tosefta is states \"just as when the torah was given the reading of the shema was established, so too  the sages established times for prayer\", this means to say that the times for prayer are not biblical, rather the obligation of prayer itself is biblical, as we explained, and the sages, may their memory be a blessing, organized times for them. And this is the concept that was stated (TB Berakhot 26b) \"The prayers were established according to the Tamid offerings\", which means to say that they established times [for prayer] according to the times for the sacrifices. And women are not obligated in this commandment. (Parshat Va'etchanan; Rambam Sefer Ahava, Hilchot Keriat Shema Chapter 1)."
