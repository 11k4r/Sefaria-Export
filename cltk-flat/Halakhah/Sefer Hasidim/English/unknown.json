        "722_Chapter, 0_Verse": "One must not cause a person to not die rapidly, for example if one was goses, and there was one close to that house chopping wood, and the neshomoh is unable to exit - they must remove the chopper from there, and they must not put salt on his tongue, in order that he will not die. But if he is goses and says that he is unable to die until they put him in another place – they must not move him from there.",
