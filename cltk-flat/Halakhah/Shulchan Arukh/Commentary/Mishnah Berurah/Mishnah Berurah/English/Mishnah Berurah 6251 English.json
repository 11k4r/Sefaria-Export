        "2_, 624_Siman, 1_Seif Katan": "For I have caused them to dwell in Sukkot: These are the clouds of glory. And as an example of them, He commanded us to make sukkot to remember His awesome and wondrous deeds. And even though we left Egypt in Nissan, He did not comman us to make Sukkot at that time for that is summer time, and everyone makes Sukkot then for shade, and it would not have been noticeable that we are doing this as a commandment, therefore He commanded us to do this in the seventh month, when it begins to rain and all people leave their Sukkot and go into their homes. And we go out from our homes and sit in the Sukkah and thus show that we are performing a mitzvah for God.",
        "2_, 624_Siman, 2_Seif Katan": "Some aharonim (recent rabbis) have written that when one enters the sukkah he should have in mind that God commanded us to sit in the Sukkah as a remembrance of the Exodus and also as a remembrance of the clouds of glory that he surrounded us with then to protect us from hot winds and sun. This is all in order to fulfill the mitzvah exactly as it should be performed, but ex post facto if he intended to fulfill the mitzvah he has done so."
