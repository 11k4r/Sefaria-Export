It is also the opinion of the Mechaber (Rav Yosef Caro) in seif 3 that eating chicken in milk is a rabbinic prohibition and is permitted for receiving benefit even rabbinically. This is also the opinion of HaRav Aharon HaLevi in the Sefer HaChinuch Mitzvah 113. It is also the opinion of the Rambam in chapter 9 of Hilchot of Forbidden Foods explained there, he also explains in his commentary of the Mishnah in Chapter All the Meat (Hullin). It is also explained by HaRav HaMaggid (Vidal of Tolosa in the Maggid Mishneh commentary on Mishneh Torah). It is also understood by Maharshal in Chapter These Forbidden Things (אלו טריפות) siman 100. And the remaining Acharonim hold like the Rambam, and not like the Bach who held that the Rambam actually thought that chicken in milk is prohibited for receiving benefit rabbinically just like eating. And HaMordechai held this in chapter אין מעמידין and noted in the final chapter of Avoda Zara that through pickling or salting it is permitted to receive benefit. and this is how the Mechaber below holds.",
        "0_, 86_Siman, 2_Seif, 0_Paragraph": "\"But meat of a pure animal in milk that is impure etc.\" The Tur says, 'but pure meat (of a kosher animal) in impure milk (milk from a non-kosher animal) or impure meat in pure milk, and meat of a chicken and non-domesticated kosher animal in pure milk is only a rabbinic prohibition for eating and are permitted to cook and receive benefit.' And the Beit Yosef writes, '[the Tur] did not intend to write this language since we don't see this language, that it is only rabbinic, for the first two cases, but only for the non-domesticated animal and chicken in pure milk. This is because in the case of pure meat in impure milk or the opposite, the Rabbis did not prohibit to eat because of mixing meat and milk. They did not establish any Rabbinic prohibitions [in this case], since it is already a Torah prohibition to consume impure meat or impure milk.' This is the corrected way to understand the text [of the Tur] and it is the proper understanding. However, the Bach understands the Tur as is written, that the first two cases are rabbinic prohibitions of mixing meat and milk. The practical reason being 'the piece becomes carrion'/ChaNaN (חנ\"נ\\ חתיכה נעשית נבילה explained in siman 92) which only applies in the case of mixing meat and milk and also to the case of 'the piece that is proper for serving' look there. This is the opinion of the Perisha. According to this, which is how we hold, ChaNaN applies to all forbidden foods, as the [Rema] writes in siman 92 seif 4 see there and search. This is also clear from Rashi and the Ran (Chapter All the Meat - Chullin 113a in the mishna) that [ChaNaN] is not a prohibition based on mixing meat and milk at all even rabbinically, and there is no reason at all that the Rabbis would prohibit on the basis of mixing meat and milk. It makes sense that the Rabbis prohibited mixing chicken with milk, lest one think they can also eat other meat milk, as the Rambam states there. However, the notion to prohibit pure meat with impure milk or vice versa has no reason to worry  about transgressing another prohibited act. This seems to be the intention of the Beit Yosef in not prohibiting [pure meat and impure milk or vice versa] on the basis of mixing meat and milk, unlike the Bach, since it is already forbidden by the Torah and there is no reason to make a decree [fence to protect against another act]. The Beit Yosef is saying that there is no practical case to prohibit on the basis of mixing meat and milk. And this is also the ruling for the case of 'the piece that is proper for serving' which explained later in seif 110. Also the Drisha writes at the end there that there is no place that pure meat and impure milk or vice versa has a rabbinic prohibition and is considered carrion on a rabbinic basis.",
        "0_, 86_Siman, 3_Seif, 0_Paragraph": "\"Meat of a wild animal and of fowl...and even eating etc.\" It is the thought of the Mechaber (Rav Yosef Caro) that meat from a wild animal and chicken is not forbidden to eat [with milk], even cooked, [from the Torah,] but only Rabbinically. And is permitted for benefit or to cook. The Maharshal and Bach relied on the Maharai (HaRav Isserlin of Temurat Deshen) on his Commentary on Shaarei Dura (Siman 76) who states that it is difficult to be lenient because of the Tosafot (Chullin 104a). Therefore, they held that meat from a wild animal and chick with milk is a Torah prohibition. In my book, I brought sources proving it is Rabbinic from the Talmud, and I brought there many opinions supporting this. Even the Maharai actually held that is only difficult to be lenient based on Tosafot regarding eat cheese immediately after chicken, but he generally agreed that mixing chicken and milk is Rabbinic. As he wrote in his Commentary of Shaarei Dura (Siman 69) that fully developed eggs are permitted to eat with milk since mixing chicken and milk is only Rabbinic [thus allowing us to be] lenient.....",

Everyday it is common practice to cook fish with milk and eat it. Also the Darchei Moshe rejects the Beit Yosef [the danger is only in cooking together, but eating one after another is fine see Darchei Moshe on the Tur Yoreh De'ah 116] as does Be'er Sheva daf 100 and other Achronim reject him in this, as does the Talmud in Chapter How do we roast (Pesachim 76b).

And the Rama goes according to his own reasoning, in that he writes in those places that we are not accustomed to rely on the tasting of a non-jew. Therefore he writes <i>\"And one needs to measure against the whole pot\"</i>.<br>And although it is implied in many places that that there is not in the volume of the amount contained in the utensil (the pot) sixty times the whole utensil (the walls and floor of the pot), one might answer that nevertheless, he is saying that one needs to measure it against the whole pot, and that therefore it will (always) be forbidden.<br><br>Alternatively, we find sometimes that the width of the pot is so big that it holds an amount of water that will be sixty times it (the walls and floor of the pot). For example if the copper (the material the pot is made of) is thin, but very wide, and like the Beis Yosef writes.<br><br>But in any case, this that we would need to measure (the contents of the pot) against the whole (walls and floor of the) pot, is by a used pot, that we don't know how much it has absorbed. But if we know how much it has absorbed, one need only measure against that amount that it had absorbed, as is said in 92:5 in the Rama, and in 94:6 and many places. And the same goes for when it was used, and we don't know how much was absorbed, but we know how much was cooked in it within 24 hours from the cooking of this milk, since what was cooked in it before 24 hours is <i>nosein ta'am lifgam</i>.

However if he cooked meat in it WITHIN 24 hours of cooking milk in it, it's obvious that the food will be forbidden (even after the fact). But if he cooked milk it's obvious that it will be permitted after the fact. <br><br>However, other things that aren't of meat or of milk (pareve items), such as vegetables and fish and things like that, are permitted to cook in it even from the outset.<br><br>And later in 94:5 the Rama writes that the custom is to forbid a utensil that had been left for 24 hours even for other things (pareve), even when one had only dipped a spoon that had been used within 24 hours.

However Maharshal in his book of Issur Veheter siman 35 rejects another similar reason, and through his rejection rejects this reason as well, see there.<br><br> And he writes (quote) that it is only with those covers that are short (confined) on top, and which have in them something like a cavity as there is in many covers, and are therefore impossible to to clean well enough to be pure of any steaming or simmering that ascended there. But those that are wide (easily accessible) on top, and one's hand is able to reach in them to scrub them well, we do not say that there is physical issur (leftover), and it is permitted, end quote. <br><br> And according to his words we are forced to say that even though that which is in the confined space is a small amount (which should generally be batul beshishim), nevertheless the steam of the meat rises above (into that confined space) less than 60 times it, until it makes the physical amount (in the confined space) neveila, and subsequently the cover itself becomes neveila, as in 98:5, that there may not be 3660 times, minus a bit, the physical amount (in the confined space), and it is similar to what we said earlier in 92:5, see there. <br><br> But at any rate one definitely need not be so stringent when dealing with a cover, just as the Rama says here.
