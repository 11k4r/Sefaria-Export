        "86_Siman, 1_Seif": "2. In the Tur it is written [as] \"...but Kosher meat in impure milk or the opposite...and wild animal meat, etc.\" - these prohibitions are rabbinical and it is permitted to cook them. The Beis Yosef concludes that if one Min (kind) is tamei, this is forbidden to be eaten according to Torah law. And why was a gezeirah enacted on it to make it forbidden to eat meat and milk...",
        "86_Siman, 2_Seif": "3. In the Beis Yosef it is written, that in any case one should not eat fish with milk because of the danger [associated with it]. And this is done to limit the danger. And it was needed to be said \"with meat\" as that was mentioned in Orach Chaim Siman 173, and such was also written in the Darchei Moshe, in that the Beis Yosef intervenes meat and milk here with the old ways, as it was in the Beis Yosef['s time] and this is not correct.",

This is not the case by mourning [one's parents] which in all cases requires [a full] twelve months. If one were to say, \"part of it is like all of it,\" one would only be required to mourn a small part of the last month, and this is obviously not correct."
