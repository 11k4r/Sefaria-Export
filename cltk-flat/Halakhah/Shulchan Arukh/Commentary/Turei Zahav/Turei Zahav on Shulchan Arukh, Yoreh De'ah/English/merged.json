        "394_Siman, 1_Seif": "\"We do not say on the 29th of Adar\" etc. The reason given (Terumat HaDeshen siman 292) is that all cases which depend on a number of days qualify for us to say part of the last day is equivalent to a full last day. This is not the case by mourning [one's parents] which in all cases requires [a full] twelve months. If one were to say, \"part of it is like all of it,\" one would only be required to mourn a small part of the last month, and this is obviously not correct."
