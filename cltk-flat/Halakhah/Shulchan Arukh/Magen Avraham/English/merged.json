        "493_Siman, 0_Seif Katan": "...It says in the Zohar that the original pious ones would be awake all the night working in Torah.  And already most of those who learn do this.  It's possible to give a reason for this according to its simple understanding, that Israel slept all the night, and the Holy One Blessed be He had to wake them, as the midrash says.  Therefore, we need to fix this. ", 
        "638_Siman, 7_Seif Katan": "<strong>A Man and His Wife.</strong> Such is apparent from the beginning of Arakhin [Arakhin 3b] where they say that priests are exempt from the Sukkah during the <i>Avodah</i>, see there. And this requires further study, for in Sukkah 28b: Since you might have thought, sit such as you dwell, since one dwells husband and wife, so too Sukkah must be husband and wife, so you have learned that women are exempt. And it should be said, that anyway the husband is not obligated in the Sukkah but where he can dwell there with his wife, and if not, he is <i>Mitzta'er</i> (discomforted) and is exempt from sleeping there, and such wrote the Shela\"h, see there. But anyway, this is still difficult, since if he made the Sukkah in a place where he cannot sleep, he has not fulfilled his obligation [when he sits in it], as is written in the Rem\"a in Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim 640:14, and if so, if he does not have a Sukkah which is isolated [so that he can sleep there with his wife modestly] he has not fulfilled his obligation at all [even when he eats therein], and another difficulty is that in the Gemara we say that \"all of Israel are fit to sit in one Sukkah\", see there. And it must be said that since he can sleep there alone, the Sukkah is valid, for it is a residence, but he is anyway exempt, for he is considered discomforted.", 
        "306_Siman, 30_Seif Katan": "31. \"It is forbidden to hint.\" And so similarly it is prohibited to say something such that he [the idolater non-Jew] will thereby understand that he should perform a prohibited act. (Rakna\"t Section 99) And thus it is prohibited to tell the idolater non-Jew \"wipe your nose\" such that he thereby understand that he should remove the soot from the head of the lamp, for specifically to say to him something by which he will understand that he should perform the act after Shabbat is permitted as written in subsection 7. But if the non-Jew does it on Shabbat, it is prohibited -- for even if the non-Jew performs labor on his own for the sake of  a Jew, it is prohibited to benefit from it (the labor), as is written in Section 325; all the more so to hint to him, as against the Bach (look there), and look at what is written in subsection 14 in the name of Rm\"m, for there we don't prohibit it because it was asked of an idolater non-Jew but rather that he told him that he can't read it.",

        "166_Siman, 3_Seif Katan": "Put both hands on the bread when you are about to bless \"Hamotzi\"; for the 10 fingers are reflective of the 10 mitzvot that are dependent on bread. Additionally, there are 10 words in the blessing of \"Hamotzi\" and 10 words in the following verses: Psalms 104:14, \"He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and grass for the service of man: that he may bring forth bread out of the land.\" Psalms 145:15, \"The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them their food at the proper time.\" Deuteronomy 8:8, \"A land of wheat and barley, of vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey.\" Bresheit 27:28, \"May G!d give you from the dew of heaven and fat of the earth, and an abundance of grain and wine.\"",

The covenant of salt protects them. Also see Siman 166 [where it states] that it is better to talk words of Torah that to sit idle. and better than both is to avoid an interruption altogether. ", 
        "105_Siman, 1_Seif Katan": "“A positive commandment” – So wrote the Rambam, who thinks that tefillah is a positive biblical commandment, as it is written, “and to serve God with all of your heart…”  But biblically, it is sufficient to recite one prayer a day, in any formulation that one wishes.  Therefore, most women have the practice of not praying regularly, because immediately after washing their hands in the morning they say some request, and this is biblically sufficient, and it is possible that the sages did not extend their obligation any further.  But the Ramban thinks that tefillah is rabbinic, and this is the opinion of most decisors.",

However, it is important to be careful not to violate any prohibitions (see Yoreh Deah 89)... ",

See also Yevamot 82 in Tosafot and the Raavad disagree in various places. In the Mishnah (Mishnah maaser Sheni 1:5) it says that if there is no mikdash it [maaser] should be left to rot. If this is so, there is no holiness even for he that enters there, and there is no [penalty of] karet. [...] The words of the Rambam are correct that one who enters the place of the mikdash is liable for karet because we are all tamei met. ",
