Rem\"a: At least, one should not delay beyond the time when the congregation prays (Tur). Rem\"a: \"I have set the Lord before me constantly\" (Psalms 16:8); this is a major principle in the Torah and amongst the virtues of the righteous who walk before God. For a person's way of sitting, his movements and his dealings while he is alone in his house are not like his way of sitting, his movements and his dealings when he is before a great king; nor are his speech and free expression as much as he wants when he is with his household members and his relatives like his speech when in a royal audience. All the more so when one takes to heart that the Great King, the Holy One, Blessed Is He, Whose glory fills the earth, is standing over him and watching his actions, as it is stated: \"'Will a man hide in concealment and I will not see him?' - the word of God\" (Jeremiah 23:24), he immediately acquires fear and submission in dread of God, May He Be Blessed, and is ashamed of Him constantly (Guide for the Perplexed III 52). And one should not be ashamed because of people who mock him in his service of God, and should also go modestly. And when he lies on his bed he should know before Whom he lies, and as soon as he wakes up from sleep he should rise eagerly to the service of his Creator, May He Be Blessed and Exalted (Tur).",

It often happens that they do not work out the dowry on Friday until nightfall, and in that case they do the betrothing and wedding on Friday night, because they already have the wedding meal ready and it would be embarrassing for the bridge and groom to not marry then. In any event, a priori one should be careful that it not come to this (and see Tur Even HaEzer Chapter 63).

Therefore, since every one of them is doubled over to make two [strings], if two ends have torn off then the tzitzis are invalid, because it could be that one string has torn [at both ends]. According to our practice - which is to be carefule when making Tzitzis to place a mark on four of the ends in such a way that these four ends are always on the same side of the knot, and the four [doubled] ends are on the other side - if two ends tear off on the same side, the Tzitzis are still Kosher, because certainly these are two [different] strings, and each one still has its second end which is more than \"long enough to tie.\" Rabbeinu Tam only accepts [Tzitzis] in a case where two complete strings remain - meaning four ends which each have a full 12-knuckle length [which is required when making new tzitzis]. Therefore he will accept them even when the other two tzitzis have torn - if they still have \"enough to tie\" - but if three have torn, even though they still have \"enough to tie\", they are invalid. Because of this, when three ends have torn, if at the time the Tzitzis were made he was not careful to ensure recognition of the four ends that came from one side of the [initial] knot, we are concerned that perhaps every end comes from a different string, and therefore there is only one complete string left - so because of this doubt we must invalidate the Tzitzis. However, if only two ends have torn, they are Kosher if \"enough to tie\" remains. The law follows the first opinion [which said that even if three or four threads are torn off, the Tzitzis are still Kosher as long as we know that each one is a torn end of a different string]. However, it is good to be concerned for Rabbeinu Tam's opinion where possible. Rem\"a: Our custom is to follow Rabbeinu Tam. Rem\"a: All the more so [according to Rabbeinu Tam], if he was precise to ensure recognition of the four ends that come from one side, and three strings tore all on one side, then the Tzitzis are posul, because we are certain that three threads have torn, and even if they tear on two different sides, we are concerned that possibly three different threads are involved.\n",

There are those who say that if he doesn't have an endangered body part, we desecrate with a slight change, and if he has an endangered body part, we break without a change. And there are those who say that even if he has an endangered body part, we do not break any prohibition that is related to a Toraitic labor, and things that have no connection, we do even if he does not have an endangered body part. This third position is right.
