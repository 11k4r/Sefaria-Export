Nevertheless, he should not make his work primary, rather temporary, and his Torah permanent. And (through this) both will be sustained. He should do business honestly and be careful not to mention the name of Heaven in vain, because in every place where the mention of God's name (in vain) is found, death is found. And he should be careful not to swear, even in truth, because 1,000 cities belonged to King Jannaeus and all of them were destroyed because they swore, even though they kept them. And he should be careful from partnering with the Kusim; perhaps (the Kusi) will be obligated to swear (agains him) and (the Jew) will violate, \"(The names of other gods) should not be heard through your mouth.\" Rama: And some are lenient with partnering with Kusim these days because the Kusim of these times do not swear by idol worship. And even though they mention the foreign idol, nevertheless their intention is to the Creator of heaven and earth, except that they join the name of Heaven and (foreign gods). And we do not find that there is in this (a violation by the Jew of) \"Before a blind person you shall not place a stumbling block,\" because the kusim are not enjoined regarding partnership (of God with idols). (Ra\"n in the last chapter of Avodah Zarah, Rabbeinu Yeruchem path 17 part 5, Tosfos in the beinning of the first chapter of Bechoros).

[There is no difference] between one who has more and one who has less, as long as his heart is directed to heaven.

There are those who have the custom to dress in Shabbat/Yom Tov clothes on Purim, and that is correct (Maharil). We have the custom to make the Purim meal after the afternoon prayer, and pray the evening prayer at night. We pray the afternoon prayer while most of the day remains, and most of the meal needs to be during the day (Minhagim). And it should not be like those who have the custom to start close to evening, and most of the meal happens during the night of the 15th. When Purim falls out on Friday, they should have the meal in the morning because of honor for the Sabbath (Minhagim). And one who wants to [have his meal] every [Purim] in the morning is allowed to (T\"H). Some say that there is [significance] to eating seeds on Purim as a remembrence for the seeds that Daniel and his friends ate in Babylonia (Kol Bo). It is good to delve a bit in Torah before one begins the meal, and a support for that is (Esther 8:16) \"The Jews had light and happiness...\", which we learn out \"radiance\" - that's Torah (Mahariv). One is obligated to drink a little and be a little happy on two days, the 14th and the 15th (Minhagim), and so is the custom.

Regarding a Jew actively breaking a rabbinic prohibition, there are some who allow it even if he does not have an endangered body part. There are those who say that if he has an endangered body part we break and if he doesn't, we do not break. There are those who say that if he doesn't have an endangered body part, we desecrate with a slight change, and if he has an endangered body part, we break without a change. And there are those who say that even if he has an endangered body part, we do not break any prohibition that is related to a Toraitic labor, and things that have no connection, we do even if he does not have an endangered body part. This third position is right. Rem\"a: It is permitted to tell a non-Jew to cook something for a child that has nothing to eat, because the needs of a child are comparable to a non-endangered sick person. And everything that is forbidden for a Jew to do is also forbidden for the sick person himself to do, but if a non-Jew is doing something, the sick person is allowed to help a bit, because aiding is not considered substantial.",

And the practice is to do libbun a priori, but scouring is sufficient if there are no crevices. If the mortar is wooden, one should peel it with an artisan's tools, because we are concerned about crevices. Afterwards, it should be scoured (Hagahot Maimoni chapter 5).",

If the retzua is too short or too narrow one should nevertheless wear them until he can obtain valid retzuos. The shel rosh should be visible but it is disrespectful for a student to allow his shel rosh to be visible to his rebbi. There is no preference whether the shel yad is visible or covered. It appears to me that nowadays since we wear tefillin only during davening a student may uncover his shel rosh before his rebbi and that is the custom.",

Therefore, since every one of them is doubled over to make two [strings], if two ends have torn off then the tzitzis are invalid, because it could be that one string has torn [at both ends]. According to our practice - which is to be carefule when making Tzitzis to place a mark on four of the ends in such a way that these four ends are always on the same side of the knot, and the four [doubled] ends are on the other side - if two ends tear off on the same side, the Tzitzis are still Kosher, because certainly these are two [different] strings, and each one still has its second end which is more than \"long enough to tie.\" Rabbeinu Tam only accepts [Tzitzis] in a case where two complete strings remain - meaning four ends which each have a full 12-knuckle length [which is required when making new tzitzis]. Therefore he will accept them even when the other two tzitzis have torn - if they still have \"enough to tie\" - but if three have torn, even though they still have \"enough to tie\", they are invalid. Because of this, when three ends have torn, if at the time the Tzitzis were made he was not careful to ensure recognition of the four ends that came from one side of the [initial] knot, we are concerned that perhaps every end comes from a different string, and therefore there is only one complete string left - so because of this doubt we must invalidate the Tzitzis. However, if only two ends have torn, they are Kosher if \"enough to tie\" remains. The law follows the first opinion [which said that even if three or four threads are torn off, the Tzitzis are still Kosher as long as we know that each one is a torn end of a different string]. However, it is good to be concerned for Rabbeinu Tam's opinion where possible. Rem\"a: Our custom is to follow Rabbeinu Tam.
