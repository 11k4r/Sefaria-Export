        "0_Orach Chaim, 429_Siman, 0_Seif": "The Sabbos before Pesach is called \"Shabbat HaGadol\" (The Great Shabbos). And the reason is because a miracle occurred during the Exodus from Egypt. On the 10th [they took a sheep] as it says: \"On the tenth of this month you shall take for yourselves a sheep into your homes.\"<br>And the year that the Exodus took place was on a Thursday as we see in Seder Olam, and therefore the \"10th of the month\" was Shabbos, and [on that Shabbos] every Jew took a sheep as a Paschal offering and tied it to their bedposts. And the Egyptians asked them \"Why is this so [why do you have a sheep (the Egyptian god) tied to your bed]?\" And they responded: \"To slaughter for a Pesach offering for HaShem.\" And they got upset that they were going to slaughter their gods, but they could not say anything due to the miracle. And thus it is called Shabbat HaGadol.", 
        "1_Yoreh Deah, 104_Siman, 0_Seif": "All halachos that apply to cooking issur with heter also apply if one soaks one in the other for one complete day -- 24 hours -- because soaking is considered like cooking. But if one soaks for less than one day: if they are cold, one only needs to wash off the item; if they are scalding hot then they are assur by cooking. ", 
        "2_Even HaEzer, 0_Siman, 0_Seif": "Blessed be the name of the Holy One, blessed is He, who desired goodness for his creations. For He knew that it is not good for man to be alone and therefore He made a fitting helper for him, for the intent of the creation of man is to be fertile and to increase, and this is impossible without a helper. Therefore He commanded him to cling to the helper whom He made for him. Thus every man is obligated to marry a woman in order to be fertile and increase, for anyone who is not involved in reproduction is like one who sheds blood, as it is written, \"Whoever sheds the blood of man,\" and juxtaposed to it , \"Be fertile, then, and increase.\" And it is as though he is diminishing the [Divine] image, for it is written that in the image of God did He create him, and you shall be fertile and increase. And he causes the Divine Presence to be removed from Israel. And anyone who remains without a wife remains without goodness, without blessing, without a dwelling, without Torah, without a wall, without peace. Rabbi Elazar said, \"Anyone who does not have a wife is not a man.\" When he marries, his sins become unreliable, as it is said, \"He who finds a wife has found happiness And has won the favor of the LORD.\" It is an extremely great commandment, for we only sell a Torah scroll in order to be able to learn Torah and to marry a woman. A man is commanded to marry a woman when he is eighteen years old, as it is taught, \"eighteen years for the [wedding] canopy,\" but one who does so earlier at the age of thirteen, this is a choice [fulfillment of the] command. Our Rabbis have taught, one who marries off his sons and daughters close to their period of puberty, regarding him Scripture states, \"You will know that all is well in your tent, etc.\" Abaye said, I am better than my colleagues because I married at the age of sixteen, but had I married at fourteen, it would have been an arrow in the eyes of Satan. But one must not marry them before thirteen, for this is like lewdness. Under no circumstance should one pass twenty years without a wife, as Raba said, and the school of Rabbi Ishmael taught, until the age of twenty the Holy One, blessed is He, waits for a man to marry. When he passes twenty years without marrying, the Holy One, blessed is He, says, \"His bones shall swell.\" My father wrote of a single man who has passed twenty years and does not want to marry, that the court forces him to marry so that he may fulfill the commandment of reproduction. However, one for whom it will be impossible to study should he marry is not obligated to marry by twenty. The words of the Rambam: If he is busy with Torah and is occupied by it, and is afraid to marry because the burden of providing sustenance will distract him from Torah, he may delay, as one who is involved in a mitzvah is exempt from another mitzvah, and all the more so in the study of Torah. One whose soul has constantly desired Torah, such as Ben Azai, and he clung to it all his days and did not marry, he has not sinned as long as his desire does not overcome him. My father the Rosh says this refers to when it would be impossible for him to study [after marrying]--then he should study and afterward marry. I do not know the extent of this study, but it cannot be that one could abstain from reproduction all his days, for we have not seen such a thing other than Ben Azai, whose soul desired Torah. Therefore, because man consists of male and female, there is a commandment of reproduction. Should the son be a eunuch or the daughter an ailonyit [a woman with arrested sexual development who cannot have children], he has not fulfilled the command of reproduction. If he had sons and they died, he has not fulfilled the command of reproduction. However if they died and left behind children, since the son had a son or daughter or the daughter had a son or daughter, reproduction has been fulfilled. But if one of them died without children and the second has a son or daughter, he has not fulfilled it. If he had children while he was a Gentile and he and his children converted, then he has fulfilled [the mitzvah of] reproduction but a slave who had sons, and he and they were freed, has not fulfilled reproduction. And even one who has fulfilled his obligation of reproduction is forbidden from remaining without a wife, as Rabbi Nachman said: Even if a man has several children, he is forbidden from remaining without a wife, as it is said, \"It is not good for man to be alone.\" Rabbi Yehoshua said: If he married in his youth, he shall marry in his old age. If he had children in his youth, he shall have children in his old age. As it is said, \"Sow your seed in the morning, and don't hold back your hand in the evening.\" There is no difference between one who has children and one who does not except with regard to the matter of selling a Torah scroll for one must always marry a child-bearing woman if he is able to [afford it] even if he has many children and if it is not within his grasp [to afford] to marry a child-bearing woman without selling a Sefer Torah then if he does not have children he should sell a Sefer Torah so that he can marry a child-bearing woman but if he already has children then he should not sell a Sefer Torah but marry a non child-bearing woman rather than remain without a wife. Some say that even if he has children he should sell a Sefer Torah so that he can marry a child-bearing woman and that there is no difference between a child-bearing and n0n-child-bearing woman except for a case where he married her and stayed ten years without her giving birth , so that if he has stayed with her for ten years he's obligated to divorce her in order to fulfill procreation but if he has children then he's not obligated to divorce her for R. Yehoshua only said that ideally he should marry a child-bearing wife [also] in his older years but he's not obligated to divorce her if she's not child-bearing  and this too is the opinion of my father my master the Rosh. A man can marry a number of wives for Rava said a man can marry many wives and this is as long as he is able to provide for them nevertheless our Sages gave good advice not to marry more than four wives so that each one can spend \"time\" [together with her husband] once / month. In a place where there is an edict not to marry more than one wife we follow that custom. A woman is not obligated in procreation therefore if she asks for a divorce on the grounds that she's unable to build a family with him, we don't listen to her as will be explained late on regarding those we force to divorce in the Laws of Divorce.", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 176_Siman, 0_Seif": "Rava Papa said the Halacha is as follows. Items that come due to the meal, during the meal do not require a blessing, not before consumption or after. For example meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, cheese or a pounded grain dish. It is not necessary to compliment the bread with the item (as in a dip), rather if the dip/ complimenting food item is eaten alone, it does not require a blessing before hand, as the blessing on the bread exempts it. Further, one doesn't need to make an after blessing, as the after bread blessing exempts it. Items that are brought to the meal, not due to the meal like dates or grapes, and all species of fruits and items not brought due to the meal because they are not like meat, fish and cooked dishes that are generally brought as the essence of the meal, require a blessing, as the blessing on bread does not exempt them since they are not part of the essence of the meal. Further, these items are not exempt from an after blessing as the after blessing of bread only exempts that which is eaten in the meal. Explanation: everything that we have mentioned above regarding coming due to the meal, or not due to the meal, if it is brought after the meal but before the after blessing, as is regularly done in large meals, that after they have withdrawn their hand from eating bread, they remove it and cover the table in fruit and desserts, and set themselves to drink anything that is brought to them, therefore whether it is something that comes due to the meal or not due to the meal, it requires a blessing before it and after it, as the blessing of bread and the after blessing can only exempt what is eaten during the meal. The Rosh writes that there is a question on one who sets his meal on fruits, if he eats from them at the beginning (of his meal), whether he needs to make a blessing on them. And there is good reason not to make a blessing, that according to me it is like items that came due to the meal, since the essence of the meal is reliant on the fruit, the bread will exempt them from a blessing, even if he eats a little of the fruit without bread. But when they bring fruits in the middle of the meal, since the essence of the meal is not on the fruit, even though it comes to compliment the bread, if it is eaten even a little without bread, one must say a blessing on them.

        "2_Even HaEzer, 3_Siman, 0_Seif": "These [people] it is not appropriate to marry [them] either because of a disqualification in their lineage or because of something physical or because of [something] illicit. A male Israelite is forbidden to marry a Mamzer, or a Netin who is from the Gibeonites that Joshua decreed against marrying them. There is a prohibition against marrying an Ammonite, Moabite and, Egyptian. [Marrying a] Mamzer or Netin, is an eternal prohibition for all generations and it makes no difference whether they're male or female. Male Ammonites and Moabites are eternally prohibited but the females are immediately permitted. Egyptians and Edomites, males and females, are prohibited for the first two generations, after an [Egyptian father] converts, he and his son are prohibited but the [Egyptian father's] grandson is permitted. A pregnant Egyptian woman who converts, her son is a second generation Egyptian. A male Israelite who copulates with one of these [mentioned above], the child is like her [ s/he has the mother's lineage], however one of those [mentioned above], except for a Mamzer, who copulates with an Israelite woman, the child may marry in to the community although it is disqualified for the priestly lineage. If a female of one of these [mentioned above] converted and married an Israelite or a male of one these [mentioned above] converted an Israelite woman, the child take the lineage of the [more] disqualified one therefore a converted second generation Ammonite or Egyptian convert who married an Israelite woman their daughter is accepted for no matter which one of them [i.e. her parents] we follow she is acceptable even for [marriage into] the priesthood even though her copulation was a transgression. A second-generation male Egyptian who marries a first-generation Egyptian woman, his son is a second-generation [Egyptian]; a first-generation Egyptian man who marries a second-generation Egyptian woman, his sone is a third-generation [Egyptian] for it all follows the mother. An Ammonite male who married an Egyptian female their child is an Ammonite, an Egyptian male who married an Ammonite female their child is an Egyptian for among the nations [in matters of lineage] we follow the males. If they converted then the child follows the more deficient of the two of them. For example an Amonite male convert who follows an Egyptian female convert or an Egyptian male convert who married an Ammonite femal convert and they gave birth to a son his status becomes an Ammonite who is eternally prohibited, if they gave birth to a daughter her status is Egyptian who is prohibited for two generations. Regarding all other nationalities, immediately after converting they have the status of an Israelite immediately. Rambam wrote that in our time both an Egyptain and an Ammonite are permitted [to marry an Israelite] immediately [after conversion] for Sennacherib arose and intermixed all of the nations and anything removed [from a mixture is viewed as if it was] removed from the majority [of the mixture] and we estimate the [individual convert] descends from the majority of nations who are permitted. My master and father the Rosh wrote that Ammonites, Moabites and Edomites are immediately permitted but also now Egyptians are prohibited [after conversion] until the third generation. A male slave who was immersed [by his Jewish master] for the purpose of becoming a [Canaanite] slave is prohibited form marrying an Israelite woman, and an Israelite man is prohibited from marrying a female slave who was immersed [by her Jewish master] for the purpose of becoming a [Canaanite] female slave, regardless of whether she was his slave or another's [slave]. However, after his master frees him, or abandons him, or lays phylacteries on him, or if his master was a prayer leader and called him to go up to the Torah [ for an aliyah] behold he comes like an Israelite in all matters but if he lay phylacteries in the presence of his master or called him or read the Torah in his presence [during an aliyah] he does not go out to freedom. If his master married him off to an Israelite woman or even if he married an Israelite woman in the presence of his master, the betrothal takes effect for certainly he [his master] has released him since he permitted him to marry an Israelite woman and certainly if it is he [the master] who is marrying his own female slave that betrothal with her takes effect. Who is a Mamzer? It is [the offspring] of a man who copulates with one of the illicit [unions] where the punishment is death administered by the [earthly] Beth Din or Kritut [death / childlessness by the Heavens] with the exclusion of one who copulated with a Niddah who is not a rabbinic Mamzer.  Rambam wrote that if her husband was overseas and she gave birth then the child is is presumed to have the status of a Mamzer for a fetus does not stay in its mother's womb for more than twelve months but the Behag wrote that the child is not presumed to have the status of a Mamzer for we attribute it to the possibility that maybe her husband arrived [home] discreetly and copulated [with her]. A married woman who gained a reputation of copulating promiscuously while under [marriage] to her husband and everyone is chattering about her, we need not worry about her children that maybe they are Mamzerim for we excuse it and say that the majority of instances of intercourse takes place with the husband but as for her we suspect her of being a promiscuous woman [zonah] and if she is exceedingly promiscuous then we are even concerned about [the Mamzer status] of her children.",

        "0_Orach Chaim, 582_Siman, 0_Seif": "In the first chapter of Keritot, we have the text (Keritot 5b): Rabbah said, \"That person that wants to know whether he will take out the year or not, should bring a candle during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur  into a room where the wind is not blowing. If its light (its flame) continues, he will know that he will continue the year. And a person that wants to conduct a business deal and wants to know if the deal will be a successful one or not, should feed a chicken. If it becomes nicely fat, he will know that it will be successful... Abbaye said,\"Now that you have said that a sign is a [correct] matter, a man should accustom himself to eating citron, squash, beans (<i>rubia</i>), leeks (<i>karti</i>), beets (<i>silkei</i>) and dates (<i>tamrei</i>) on Rosh Hashanah.\" Rashi explains that <i>rubia</i> is clover.  <i>Rubia</i> - our merits should increase (<i>yirbu</i>); <i>karti</i> - (the enemies) should be cut off (<i>yikaretu</i>), etc.; <i>silkei</i> - removed (<i>yistalku</i>), etc.; <i>tamrei</i>  finished (<i>yitamu</i>), etc.; squash because it is quick to grow. And from this grew the [various] customs, every place according to its custom; as in Germany, where they are accustomed to eating sweet apple with honey at the beginning of the meal, to say, \"Let this new year be sweet for us.\" And in Provence they are accustomed to bring all types of novelties [to the meal] and to eat a sheep's head and lung, to say, \"Let us be at the head and not at the tail;\" and the lung because it is light.

        "0_Orach Chaim, 262_Siman, 0_Seif": "And he should be cautious to make a fine lamp, as R. Huna said: One who is regular [to light] a Shabbat lamp, to strive to perform this, and to make it attractive, will have sons who are scholars. And there are those who make two wicks, one to correspond with \"Remember\" and one to correspond with \"Observe.\" But if he cannot afford to buy a lamp for Shabbat and a lamp for Hannukah, Shabbat takes priority. Similarly if he cannot afford to buy a candle and wine for Kiddush, the candle takes priority because of domestic tranquility, for there is no domestic tranquility without a lamp. And he should not hurry to light it while the day is still long, for then it won't be known that he lights it for the honor of Shabbat. Nor should he light late. And when he lights he blesses: Blessed are you, Lord our God, King of the universe who has sancitified us with his commandments and commanded us to light the Sabbath lamp. Both men and women are commanded to light this, but women are more commanded than men, as it says in the Midrash: Since she extinguished the lamp of the world, meaning she caused the death of the first human. And the Rambam explains [that women are more obligated] because they are found at home and they take care of household needs. And there are those who says that we should not recite a blessing over it, and they explain that if the lamp was already lit he need not extinguish it in order to go back and light it again, nor need he light another lamp. But this is not a good reason, for with regard to covering the blood [of a bird or wild animal that was slaughtered] we taught: If the wind covered [the blood] he need not go back and cover it again, and nevertheless we bless the covering. Furthermore, Rabbenu Tam said that if it was already lit he must extinguish it and go back and light it again. For an elder said: We have taught: As long as he doesn't do it too early or too late. And so too wrote Rav Amram: One who lights the Shabbat candle blesses. And so too wrote the Halakhot Gedolot that the acceptance of Shabbat is dependent upon the lighting of the candle, for once he has lit the Shabbat candle Shabbat has begun for him. And for this reason he wrote that one must first light the Hannukah lamp before the Shabbat candle for if he does Shabbat first, he cannot afterwards light the Hannukah candle. But the Tosafot wrote that [the beginning of Shabbat] is not dependent on the lighting of the lamp for even after he lights, Shabbat has not begun for him. Rather it is dependent on the maariv prayer, for Shabbat begins once he has prayed maariv.   ",

Therefore, before one's hands are washed, one must refrain from touching the mouth, the nose, the ears, and the eyes with one's hand, as the evil spirit rests upon them. And if one does not have water, one should wipe his hands on a stone or anything that cleans, and bless, \"\"Blessed are you Adonai, our God, King of the universe, that has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the cleanliness of hands.\"",

The Rambam wrote that one must make the tzitzit the same color as the tallit: i.e. if the tallit is red, the tzitzit should be red, and if the tallit is green, the tzitzit should be green.

        "2_Even HaEzer, 1_Siman, 0_Seif": "A man should not marry a woman unless she is fitting for him, meaning, she has no disqualification for anyone who married a woman who is not fitting for him, when the Holy One blessed be He testifies about the tribes He will not testify for him and it will be as if he has ploughed the whole world and planted it with destruction [salt in other texts] meaning he brings barrenness to the world and he will have children who are unfit and God does not rest His Divine Presence except on families with lineage, meaning they have no trace of disqualification and what is a sign of this? One who hears his shamefulness and keeps quiet for as Rav explained the lineage of Babylonia is their silence nevertheless a family where a possible disqualification got mixed into it there is no need to distance them for all are pure in the future - this refers to an Israelite but a Kohen should not marry them as we say later on. And all lands remain with an assumed fit status and when a man or woman who comes to marry [there] one does not need to check their status at all but Rashi explained that a man who comes to marry a woman, one needs to check his status before he marries her and so too wrote the RaMa and explained that when it says all the families are considered to be fit, this means that one who had a fit status, one need not check after him but one who does not have a fit status, for example his family is not known needs proof about their lineage and a single witness is not believed  even though fit females were were not warned against marrying unfit males, this was referring to met unfit for the priesthood but men unfit to be counted among the Jewish Community, if one comes to marry a Jewish woman we do not permit it until a proof is brought for maybe he is a slave these are his words. To me it seems that the expression \"all the families are considered to be fit\" does not sound like his words for it is referring to a case where a person does have a presumption of fitness and Rabbeinu Tam explained that we only check [for marriage into] the priesthood and that which we learned that if someone marries a woman he needs to check her four mothers that means  that his son would not be fit to serve [as a kohen] at the altar and his daughter would not be fit to marry a kohen unless he married a woman who was checked out and even for the priesthood only a man checks the woman but a woman of the priestly lineage need not check after a man for fit women were not wanted against marrying disqualified men but when it comes to lineage where there is no priestly angle there is no need to check and these are his [Rabbenu Tam's] words. It sounds from his words that for the priestly lineage one must check and so to wrote the Rambam this is his language [Laws of Forbidden Intercourse 20:1] \"1) All the priests in our day are assumed to be priests and they only partake in holy food that can be consumed within the borders [of eretz yisrael], meaning rabbinic Teruma however of Torah ordained Teruma and of Torah ordained Hallah only a priest with definite lineage may partake. Who is a priest with definite lineage? Anyone about whom two witnesses testified that he is a priest and the son of john doe priest the son of john doe priest until we arrive at a man [whose priesthood] does not need to to be checked and he is a priest who served at the altar for had the Sanhedrin not checked after his status they would not have permitted him to serve.\" These are his [Rambam's] words and it seems that even for priestly lineage one need not check for on that Mishna [Kiddushin 76a] of \"a priest who marries a woman must investigate four mothers\" we conclude [Kiddush 76b] \"Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: This mishna is the view of Rabbi Meir, but the Rabbis say: All families retain a presumptive status of fitness. Rav Ḥama bar Gurya say that Rav says [our mishna is referring only to a case] when an objection was registered\" then one needs to check. Therefore we see that we probably need no checking nonetheless it is possible that although according to the Sages one does not need to check, the law follows an anonymous Mishna and a priest marrying needs to check his wife [the daughter of a priest]. Maimonides wrote that although all the families are presumed to be fit and one is allowed to marry into them, ideally two families that are always quarreling with each other or a family that is always contentious and combative or a man who is always looking for an argument with everyone and is very brazen we are worried about their status and it is appropriate to stay away from them for these are symptoms of disqualification. Similarly, someone who always disqaulifies others, for example he offers disqualifying innuendo about families or individuals and says about them that they are Mamzerim we are concerned that he himself may be a Mamzer and if he says about them that they are slaves we are concerned that maybe he is a slave for all who disqualify are themselves disqualified with the same disqualification. Similarly, someone who is is arrogant and cruel and hates people and does not act kindly we are concerned that he may be a Gibeonite for the signs of an Israelite, the holy nation is that they are shy, merciful and doers of kindness", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 0_Siman, 0_Seif": "Judah ben Tema says: \"Be as strong as a panther, as light as an eagle, running like a gazelle and mighty as a lion to perform the will of your Father in heaven.\"  He specified four things concerning the service of the Creator, may He be blessed. And he began with ‘strong as a panther’ since it is a great general principle of service to the Creator, may He be blessed, since sometimes a person desires to perform a mitzvah but is prevented from performing it because of people who mock him; therefore he warned that he should have fortitude against the mockers and not refrain from performing the mitzvah. So said Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai to his students: “May it be your will that the fear of heaven be upon you like the fear of flesh and blood.” And so he says concerning the subject of shame, that sometimes a person is ashamed before a person more than he is ashamed before the Creator, may He be blessed. Therefore he warned that you should have fortitude against the mockers and not be ashamed. So too did David, peace be upon him, say “I will speak of your decrees in the presence of kings and not be ashamed,” though he was pursued and he fled among the nations, he had taken strength in his Torah and learned, though they had mocked him. And he said ‘as light as an eagle’ corresponding to the eye’s vision, and compared it to an eagle because just as the eagle soars through the air, so too does the eyes’ vision, meaning that you should shut your eyes from seeing evil, for it is the beginning of transgression, for the eye sees, the heart covets and the person's limbs [?] complete the act. And he said ‘as strong as a lion’ corresponding to the heart, for the might of service of the Creator, may he be blessed, is in the heart, and he stated that you should strengthen your heart for His service. He stated ‘run like a gazelle’ corresponding to the legs, for your legs shall run toward the good. So too would David the king, peace be upon him, pray for the three of them, but he changed the sequence, “Lead me in the path of your commandments” about legs. Following that he said “Turn my heart to your decrees.” And after that he said “Avert my eyes from seeing falsehood.” Concerning the heart he mentioned ‘turn,’ whereas concerning the eye, ‘avert,’ for the heart is in his power to turn toward the good path or the evil one, even after he has seen a false [?] incident. Thus he prayed that he should help him to turn to the good path. But seeing falsehood is not in his power, for it is possible that it will come upon him suddenly, and he will see it. Thus he prayed that he avert his eyes from seeing falsehood, and he did not summon him [?] before him at all. Thus a person needs strengthen himself as a lion to stand in the morning for the service of his Creator, even if his evil impulse taunts him in winter, saying ‘How can you get up in the morning when the cold is so great?’ or taunts him in summer, saying ‘How can you get up from your bed when you have not had enough sleep?’ he should strengthen himself to rise, for you should awaken the dawn, but it should not awaken you, as David, peace be on him, stated “Awake, my soul, awake, harp and lyre; I will awaken the dawn,” ‘I awaken the dawn, but the dawn does not awaken me.’ So much the more so had he awakened prior to the morning light to rise and offer supplications before his Creator, how great His beauty, and how good. And it is good that one who begins early should aim for the hours when the guard shifts change, which are at a third of the night, and at the end of two thirds of the night and at the end of the night, for at these times does the Holy One, blessed be He, recall the destruction of the Temple and the dispersion of Israel among the nations, and the prayer which a person offers at that hour for the destruction and the dispersion is propitious and close to acceptance. His supplication shall fall before God whether drawn out or cut short, it is only that he should orient his heart toward heaven in his supplications, for better a little with intention than increasing them out without intention. It is well to say the section of the Akedah and the section of the manna, and the Ten Commandments and the section of the sacrifices, namely the section of the burnt offering and the meal offering and the offering of well being and the sin offering and the guilt offering. Of course it is preferable to say the section of the sacrifices during the day, for they are in place of the offering of the sacrifice, whose time is during the day. When he concludes the section of the burnt offering, he shall say ‘Master of the universe, may it be your will that this be considered and accepted before you as if I had offered a burnt sacrifice in its time. So too shall he say after the section of the meal offering and the offering of well being and the guilt offering. But after the section of the sin offering, he shall not so say, since it does not come freely. And if he is not able to rise early, prior to morning light, in any case he designates the time of the prayer which he is designates for all of life, and should not tarry. And he should well consider in his heart, if he had been in the service of a flesh and blood king who commanded him to rise early at the morning light to his service, he would have taken care and rushed to arise for the service which he commanded him, so much the more so, all the more and all the more so much the more so  before the King of kings of kings, the Holy One blessed be He.",

My lord and father (Rabbeinu Asher) would put them on and say a blessing upon them.  ", 
        "0_Orach Chaim, 688_Siman, 0_Seif": "All are required in the Reading of the Megillah: Cohens, Levites, Israelites, slaves, an invalidated Cohen, a mamzer, a natin, a tumtum, an androgynous person; children are also educated in this commandment, and women are also required to fulfill [the Megillah's] reading. Rashi interprets that women can fulfill men's obligation to read the Megillah, but the author of the [halachic work] Halachot Gadolot says that even though this may be the case, they do not fulfill men's obligation. The Ba'al HaItur wrote that it makes sense, because just like women say Grace After Meals to themselves and don't make a zimun, so too here they do not join the communal reading from the outset. An androgynous person fulfills the obligation of both those like him and others; a tumtum, and a one who is half free and half slave, he does not fulfill the obligation even of others like him. A deaf person, someone with mental handicaps, and a child, even one who has reached the age of education, do not fulfill the obligation of others. Rabbi Yehuda allows a child, because he has reached the age of education. The Ba'al HaItur held like [Rabbi Yehuda]. My father brought the Mishnah in its form, and established the law like the first opinion [that a child cannot fulfill the obligation of others], and the author of Halachot Gadolot held similarly. In the Jerusalem Talmud it says that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi gathered all the members of his household and read in front of them. From here we learn that in some places, it is the custom to bring little children to listen to the Megillah.",

In addition, replacement pall-bearers that are not immediately needed are exempt from prayer even though they are obligated in recitation of the shma.  Women and slaves are obligated in [prayer].",

The number of stitching should be three to each side, as it is with the tefillin for the head. The strap should be place through the passageway and a knot should be made to hold it in place on one’s arm, and at the end of that strap one should fashion a small knot in the shape of the letter yod which completed the letter of the divine name Shaddai, along with the letter shin imprinted in the boxes and the letter daled in the knot for the tefillin for the head. There are those who cut the end of the knot to make it look like the letter yod. There is a custom to put hide on the box covering the area of the arm that it is on . The reason for the custom is that the boxes of the arm tefillin are ‘taller and narrower’ (than the box for the head tefillin) and they are place under the clothes and they tend to move under the clothing and get ruined. It is because of this that they will put a strap of hide(s) on top of them. ",
