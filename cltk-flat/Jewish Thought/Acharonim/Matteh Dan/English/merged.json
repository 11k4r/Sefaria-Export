        "2_First Dialogue, 0_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "The young David, son of the wise and understanding Rabbi Pinchas Nito, of blessed memory asked me his beloved and dear companion to write a book on the arguments and responses that I had to those who deny the received oral tradition from the Talmudic Sages and to fulfill this request [of his] I gathered what I found written on this matter from the debates of the second Rabbi with the king of the Khazars in the year 5470 (1719-1720) and the incident went as follows:",
        "2_First Dialogue, 0_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "1) This wise man came from Venice, the city of his birth, by boat in the heart of the sea to go to his trip to the lands of the east. And it was on the tenth day of his journey that there was a big storm at sea. He took the boat and took it to a province among the provinces of the Khazar kingdom and he came onto dry land where the people greeted him with great honor and much embrace.And the King was told that one of the Sages of Israel had come to his city. He sent for him and greeted him and [the scholar] came and bowed to the king, with his face to the ground, 3 times, and said, “Long live the king.” The king got up and embraced him with great joy and said “Blessed is your coming; those who come are blessed by Hashem, Blessed are you to God most High and blessed is God most High who I trusted in and who answered me from his holy name (cf. Genesis 14:18-19) since from when I first acquired intellectual understanding I melt my couch in tears (cf. Psalms 6:7) and I poured out my soul before God in sackcloth and ashes, praying to him and asking of him for the welfare of my nation for I feared that, as I had said, “Lo, we may turn out to be like loot to the Karaites who wish to entice and misdirect them from sharing in Hashem’s possession (cf. 1 Samuel 26:19), that is, the Oral Torah.  Even though it has been almost 600 hundred years since the God who guided my ancestors sent the great Rabbi, Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, may the memory of the righteous man and saint be a blessing, who saved our souls from stumbling; the idols are all naught (cf. Isaiah 44:9) and from then did they begin to call out in the name of the Hashem (Genesis 4:26) in my kingdom, indeed, until today our hearts have not gone astray (cf. Psalms 44:19). Praises to God who let us taste and see [the words of Rabbi Yehuda Halevi] in his important and precious work whose name is like mine, <i>The Khazar</i>, for God is good to all those who call out to him in truth. (cf. Psalms 145:18)  Thus do the bards say (cf. Numbers 21:27) “All the words of Rabbi Yehuda Halevi are true.” They also say “Guard yourself lest you abandon Halevi<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Hebrew this is a pun. The verse is talking about neglecting the Levites (Heb. Halevi). The person referred to was called Rabbi Yehuda Halevi in Hebrew. </i>” (cf. Deuteronomy 12:19). He, of blessed memory, is the thrust of my company (cf. Habakkuk 1:9) and in his dialogues with my ancestor king Joseph, his memory be with us to the world to come, he only spoke about the written Torah and he only spoke a little, of no consequence, (cf. Isaiah 16:14) about the Oral Torah and because of this, my heart is sick (cf. Jeremiah 8:18) that the Karaites who object to and dispute the tradition of the Talmudic Sages make good bad, light darkness, sweetness bitterness and truth falsity. Therefore, smoke gathered in my nostrils, they embittered and saddened my spirit (cf. Isaiah 63:10) and I became angry at their vanities (Deuteronomy 32:21). My heart also did not sleep at night and sadness was added to the pains of my life. The Sages of my country are before them like an ewe, dumb before those who shear her, (cf. Isaiah 53:7) because they have no power and are curbed by bit and bridle (cf. Psalms 32:9) since the answers are not written down “according to the teaching that they instruct”(cf. Deuteronomy 17:11) and [the Karaites] mock them and curl their lips (Psalms 22:8) [saying things that are] against our tradition. This was a trap for me for wrath for the Talmudic Sages had devoured me and I was reviled for it (Psalms 69:11) and I said,“O that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away (cf. Psalms 55:7) and go around the four corners of the earth to find one of the Sages of Israel who will teach me both scriptural and intellectual arguments for the truth of the Oral tradition.” Even though the first part of that had been composed by Emanuel Abuhab, of blessed memory, who wrote a wonderful book in Spanish on this subject called <i>Nomology</i> (meaning, Religious Debates) and all his words are true and correct it did not accomplish all that I needed for there are two questions concerning this great matter. 1) Whether it is possible to understand the written Torah without an Oral tradition. 2) Whether the explanation of the Talmudic Sages is the same one Moses received at Sinai:",
        "2_First Dialogue, 0_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Now, our opponents agree with us concerning part of the two questions and they disagree concerning part because even they concede that a tradition is required to know which organ is to be circumcised because the Torah does not say. A tradition is also needed to know whether the months referred to in the Torah are solar or lunar. They, however, argue concerning [the traditions about] the size of a Sukkah and concerning the material and shape of phylacteries and such. They also agree with us concerning the answer to part of the second question and agree that Chazal knew which organ was to be circumcised and concerning the 39 prohibitions on the Sabbath for they teach just like us concerning them but they disagree with us concerning their explanation and concerning all the commandments to some extent since they each explain it according to their own deliberation and not in accordance with the tradition of the Talmudic Sages. Each and every one of them build a private altar for themselves (cf. Chagigah 22a:15) and says “accept my words” (cf. Pirkei Avot 4:8) and thus have made collections and bundles [of explanations] and didn’t say in their hearts “Let us revere Hashem our God (cf. Jeremiah 5:24) who sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us that we should have one ritual for all of us(cf. Numbers 15:29). So you should know I am not speaking solely out of [the fantasies of] my heart (cf. Numbers 16:28) I will hold forth; listen to me (cf.  Job 15:17) [relate] what I saw in a book that came into my possession by one of their own, Eliyahu Ben Moshe, who admits, without any embarrassment, that there were 3 disputes among them concerning the timing of circumcision when the 8th day falls on the Sabbath. In the early generation they circumcised on the Sabbath because they exegeted along the lines of “on the 8th day you shall circumcise (cf. Leviticus 12:3) even on the Sabbath” (Shabbat 132a:1). Then, another generation arose after them (cf. Judges 2:10) who were worried about desecration of the Sabbath and pushed off circumcision to Sunday. Their kids in turn, that is, the third generation, departed quickly from the paths their fathers taught them (cf. Judges 2:17 and Jeremiah 9:13) and they recanted and were more concerned about doing circumcision on specifically the 8th day and they concluded to reverse their decision and circumcise on the Sabbath as was the original custom but they decided they would circumcise after sundown which is the time between day and night which they call <i> The Departure of the Sabbath </i>. According to their view at this time it’s the Sabbath from the point of view of the day but isn’t considered the Sabbath for the purposes of desecration thereof and they don’t understand that these are two contradictory ideas and they cannot both be admitted with regard to one subject.",
        "2_First Dialogue, 0_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "In the end the voice had made itself heard (cf. Ecclesiastes 12:13) <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup> This is a pun on the verse, “sof davar hakol nishma” which when the word hakol is spelled with a Kaf instead of a Qof which is how it’s spelled in the verse as opposed to here means “in the end, let it be heard [fear God and revere his commandments for this is all of a man.]”   that the Karaites dispute most of the Oral Torah and the sage mentioned above wished to argue against them with this syllogism that I learned from his words, of blessed memory.",
        "2_First Dialogue, 0_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "1)It is impossible to understand the written Torah without an oral tradition. 2)The Talmudic Sages explained the written Torah. 3) If so, their explanation is the proper oral tradition.",
        "2_First Dialogue, 0_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "And now the disputer of the tradition will argue that the conclusion does not follow from the premises even though he concedes part of the first premise of the syllogism and agrees that it impossible to understand even a bit of the written Torah without an oral tradition. Additionally, though they also concede part of the second premise thus conceding that the Sages explained the written Torah they hurry, hasten, object and dispute the conclusion and reject [the conclusion] with two hands for they say that even though they may have had a correct tradition about some specifics such as circumcision and the calendar and such, all the rest are the fruits of the thoughts of our Rabbis, of blessed memory,  and that our Sages and elders are deceivers (may the mouth of he who speaks lies be shut) (cf. Psalms 63:11) and therefore it is obligatory upon us to stand up and strengthen the first premise among all and to teach that the conclusion is true and that the tradition of the Talmudic Sages is like the Earth giving forth its growth (cf. Isaiah 61:11) and all the inhabitants of the world (cf. Psalms 33:8) will see and know that what were taught and learned concerning the exposition of the Torah is what God told Moses at Sinai. Since, until now, not one of the later Jewish Scholars spoke about this matter save a few, general words the dissenters have become emboldened and open their mouths and speak at length against the first generations as if to say “Pursue him and catch him, for he has no savior!” (cf. Psalms 71:11) Indeed, blessed be God who has not withheld from them a savior (cf. Ruth 4:14) and I trust in his faithfulness. [They desired a savior so that] there should be a shelter and refuge from the current of dissent and my heart said to me that is was not bought to cause a flood of much water rather the Lord God only sent you to fill up the place that our ancestors left for us and so to remove this horrible thing (cf. Isaiah 26:1) <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This is a pun on Isaiah 26:1 which when the Shin is read as a Sin can mean what is meant here. </i> from the land of Judah and that the house of Israel recognize God. Now, lovers of the Rabbi [Yehuda Halevi] strengthen yourself and be a warrior drawing out his spear and helmet to greet the dissenters to the truth of the Talmudic Sages, the most trustworthy of Israel. Gird your loins like a strong man. I will ask you and you will make known to me the proofs that you have concerning the Oral Torah that you have and what you see on this and what came to you and I will then respond to the disparagement of those who are now in Eden, the garden of God (cf. Ezekiel 28:13)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Eden is also a name for the Jewish afterlife. </i>",
        "2_First Dialogue, 1_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "2) Rabbi: My master the king, all your you have said is good for not one of our later Sages proved this principle on which everything hangs. This principle being that the explanation of the Talmudic Sages for the Torah and commandments is the self-same oral Torah that Moses received at Sinai. The reason for this is that all the Jewish people rely on the trust in the Talmudic Sages that is their inheritance for them from their ancestors for generation after generation. [They are] “believers, the sons of believers” (cf. Shabbat 97a:4) and it therefore does not occur to them to ask what they will answer to the Karaites who speak lies (cf. Psalms 144:8 and Psalms 144:11) against the Talmudic Sages. Due to this the boundary breakers have grown as have those who speak badly about their tradition in these days and at this present time. Therefore, we must make known that they are trustworthy and that their words are true. First I will prove that all the commandments that God gave prior to giving the Torah were oral traditions. After that I will prove that in the days of the prophets who authored scripture there was an oral tradition and that even regarding the clearly explained commandments there are, within them, closed commandments [save for the oral tradition clarifying these aspects] and afterwards I will clarify and add that the oral explanation of the Torah the Talmudic Sages gave us is what Moses received at Sinai. I just ask first from our God who gave us a true Torah that he help me for the glory of his name (cf. Psalms 79:9) that the wise shall obtain honor (cf. Proverbs 3:35) that He may magnify and glorify the Torah (cf. Isaiah 42:21).",
        "2_First Dialogue, 1_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "God’s strategy for giving to his nation, Israel, a Torah that was mostly oral was to accustom humanity from the beginning to accept oral traditions about commandments so it should not be strange concept to later generations – children yet to be born – (cf. Psalms 78:7) of the children of Israel to receive most of their Torah from oral tradition and thus the first commandment that was commanded to Adam, that is not to eat from the tree of knowledge (cf. Genesis 2:17) was an oral tradition and not written down for behold it wasn’t written down in a book until Moses received the Torah at Sinai (cf. Pirkei Avot 1:1). So too, the commandment to not murder and the proof that God, blessed be he, punished Cain for his killing of Abel his brother (cf. Genesis 4:12) and he admitted and praised the uprightness of this judgment upon himself when he said, “my sin is too great to bear!”(cf. Genesis 4:13) Had he not been warned from the start he could’ve apologized and say that he didn’t know that a murderer is liable for his soul. We see the same thing with the generation of the flood that they were punished because, “the land was full of corruption on their account” (cf. Genesis 6:12) and “since all flesh on the earth corrupted their ways.”(cf. Genesis 6:13) Since “honest scales and weights are Hashem’s” (cf. Proverbs 16:11) he certainly would not punish them had he not previously warned them and commanded them about the prohibition on violence and promiscuity for the intellect dictates (cf. Psalms 94:10) that someone should not receive lashes unless he was warned [that if he does an action he’ll be lashed because otherwise we couldn’t establish criminal intent.] So too Noah was commanded not to eat flesh from a live animal as is written, “But, a living animal’s blood shall you not eat” (cf. Genesis 9:4) and then he went back and commanded regarding murder as is written “he who spills the blood of man owns’ blood shall, in turn, be spilled by men.”(cf. Genesis 9:6) He also struck Pharaoh with mighty plagues. (cf. Genesis 12:17) He also closed fast every womb of the house of Abimelech because of the matter of Sarai, the wife of Abram (cf. Genesis 20:18 and Genesis 12:17) because of his desire to sleep with her to be with her (cf. Genesis 39:10) and she was married (cf. Genesis 20:3). All of these are negative commandments and they were all originally oral traditions.",
        "2_First Dialogue, 1_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "We also find this same phenomenon with regards to Cain and Abel and Noah and the Patriarchs building altars and sacrificing things to God.",
        "2_First Dialogue, 1_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "God commanded Abraham, of blessed memory, regarding circumcision and said before the upturning of Sodom and Gomorrah, “Shall I hide from Abraham What I am about to do… for I have known him so he should command his children and his house after him and guard the way of Hashem and to do charity and justice.”(cf. Genesis 18:17-19) Scripture also attested about him “And he obeyed my charge: my commandments, my laws and my teachings.” (cf. Genesis 26:5) Jacob commanded his house and all those who were with him, “remove the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourself and change your clothes.” (cf. Genesis 35:2)",
        "2_First Dialogue, 1_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "Now, I will ask of all wise-hearted men (cf. Exodus 36:2 and Exodus 36:1) to whom God gave intellect and understanding (cf. 1 Chronicles 22:12) that he instruct me and tell me who went up to Heaven and came down (cf. Proverbs 30:4) to tell Cain and Abel and Noah and the Patriarchs that God wants and desires the sacrifices of men for the intellect does not require this. Quite the contrary it is written “If I am hungry I will not tell you for I have the earth and its bounty.”(Psalms 50:12) And why did he accept Abel’s sacrifice while Cain’s was disregarded? What did he do and what sign was given to them to know what was desired and what was undesired. I will also ask what is the charity, the judgments, the laws, the teaching and the commandments (cf. Genesis 26:5) that Abraham, our forefather kept which he taught his children to observe for it seems that there were many of them (cf. Zechariah 10:8) from the plain sense of scripture and we know of none save circumcision. Also, what bad thing or impurity is found in a form of metal or in wood or stone that it would impurify that which was in their possession? Why would they need to purify themselves and change their clothes? [The answer to this is that] one must is forced to admit and believe necessarily that all the laws and judgments that God, blessed be he, commanded prior to the Sinai revelation whether they be known to us (cf. Machzor Yom Kippur Ashkenaz, The Morning Prayer, Amidah 104), such as the prohibition of eating a limb from a live animal, circumcision, theft etc. or whether they are unknown to us such as “my commandments laws and teachings”(cf. Genesis 26:5) that are mentioned regarding Abraham that they were oral traditions and not written down. [You also must say] that God commanded these things to whatever person or group at whatever time and it is hidden from us and we know not [to who and when these were given]."
