        "3_House I, 9_Chamber, 15_Window, 0_Paragraph": "The commandment of telling over the exodus from Egypt every year on Passover night: It said (Exodus 13:8), \"And you are to tell your child on that day.\" And the intent is not only to inform our children who did not know and did not hear of this great act of the Lord. Rather even the sages, the discerning ones and those who know the whole entire Torah must tell over the exodus from Egypt on that night. It is like our ancestors, may their memory be blessed, said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Passover Haggadah</i> \"And even if we were all sages, all discerning, all knowledgeable about the Torah, it would [still] be a commandment upon us to tell the story of the exodus from Egypt. And anyone who adds [and spends extra time] in telling the story of the exodus from Egypt, behold he is praiseworthy.\" And it brings a proof, the story of five great sages, Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Akiva and their colleagues, who were telling the story of the exodus from Egypt that whole night. And don't say that they were telling it to the students who did not know, but they<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These sages</i> rather sat by themselves. For when the dawn arose, the students came to them to inform them that the time of [reciting] the morning Shema had arrived. And it is like they said, \"until their students came, etc.\" That is because this story is not the same for every person. Rather each one should recount the greatness of God and the ways of His wisdom that were revealed through the wonders that He did in Egypt, according to the power of his mind and his understanding; and according to the extent of his understanding and his knowledge of the ways of God, the images written in the Torah about the stories of the exodus from Egypt, the tradition of the fathers about these matters and the hidden wonders about them. And from this, you can understand the difference in the performance of this commandment between different people. And these differences branch out from the differences that we explained in (Chapter) 8 about the first commandments.  "
