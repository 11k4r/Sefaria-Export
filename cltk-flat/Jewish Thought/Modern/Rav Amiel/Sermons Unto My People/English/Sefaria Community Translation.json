        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Amalek: the symbol of militarism ",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "Even a superficial reading shows Amalek to be the symbol of militarism for whom the sword serves not only as a means but also as the purpose of life, or, rather, the entire content of his life. These are people who go to war not out of necessity, when they have no other choice, but rather as if going to a dance. Only in war do find a place where they can show off and highlight their power and being. ",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 18_Paragraph": "“The Eternal will be at war with Amalek in all generations” and in the words of the Sages, “The sword and the book descended from heaven intertwined” (Devarim Rabbah 4: 2). Amalek was granted a greater share of the sword than other peoples; and Israel of the book, and one can only be built from the destruction of the other. When one is ascendant, the other falls; therefore there is a perpetual war between Israel and Amalek.",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 19_Paragraph": "Write this as a memorial in a book",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 20_Paragraph": "What means do we use to fight the Amalekites and all masters of the sword? How can we think to put an end to militarism in the world? After all, in our day, with our own eyes we have seen a “commanded” war of that type, The Great War that fought under the banner of “a war to end all wars.” The consequences of this war are all too well known to everyone. ",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 21_Paragraph": "Indeed, under Jewish procedural law, the prosecutor can become an advocate, evil cannot be uprooted from the world using evil itself, we cannot remove terror from the world by using terrorism on the other side, and therefore we do not fight a mighty arm with a mighty arm, or the sword with a sword. ",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 22_Paragraph": "When Judaism declared war on militarism, it was not through militarism, rather “the ETERNAL said to Moses, “write this as a memorial in the book.” ",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 23_Paragraph": "This means that the war against the sword is [fought] by the book.",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 13_Chapter, 24_Paragraph": "The book of paper and parchment will endure longer than all the swords made from many kinds of metal, it will defeat all the swords and cannon tools in the world, all will be beaten and scattered to the wind, and the book shall reign alone. ",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 23_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "The Holiday of Eliyahu (Elijah) the Prophet",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 23_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "The holiday of Passover is the holiday of Eliyahu the Prophet in particular. When we, God willing, will sit at the Seder in another few days, we will see the cup of Eliyahu before us. The door will open, and the honorable Eliyahu himself will come in as we greet him with, welcome! Then he hears our gut-wrenching and heart-breaking prayer, \"Pour your wrath upon the nations that did not know You and upon the kingdoms that did not call upon Your Name! Since they have consumed Yaakov and laid waste his habitation (Psalms 79:6-7), etc.\" And it is not only the holiday of Passover, but rather also Shabbat Hagadol (the Shabbat before Passover) that is dedicated to Eliyahu the prophet. So in that day's haftara, we speak only about him. But why. ",
        "3_Chanuka, Purim, and Special Shabbatot, 23_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "It is simple that it is because it is impossible for the salvation to come without outstanding self sacrifice, without a special holy enthusiasm to which nothing else in the world can compare. "
