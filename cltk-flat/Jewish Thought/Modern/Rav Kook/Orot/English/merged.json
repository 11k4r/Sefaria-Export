        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "The land of Israel is not an external thing, an external national acquisition, a means to the goal of general unity and strengthening of the physical or even spiritual. The land of Israel is an intrinsic section of the nation, attached to it with a living bond, entwined with its existence in internal uniqueness.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "It is therefore impossible to explain the uniqueness of the sanctity of the land of Israel, to actualize the depths of love for her, in any humanly rational way. It is only through the divine spirit which is on the nation as a whole, through the natural spiritual nature which exists in the soul of Israel, which spreads out through ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "Contemplating the Land of Israel as an external value which serves only the purpose of uniting the ‎nation, even for the sake of enabling the Jewish idea in exile, guarding its form, strengthening faith ‎and reverence and strengthening practical mitzvot in their proper form, does not produce durable ‎fruit. This foundation is rotten, compared to the sacred strength of the Land of Israel. True ‎strengthening of the Jewish idea in exile will only come via deep embedding in the Land of Israel; ‎via yearning for the Land of Israel, [the Jewish idea] will continually receive all of its independent ‎traits.‎",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Anticipating of redemption is the force which maintains Jewry in exile, and the Judaism of the Land ‎of Israel is the redemption itself…‎",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 1_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "As man distances himself from the secrets of Torah, his understanding of the Kedusha of Eretz Yisrael becomes hazy.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 1_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "We do not reject any conception or understanding [of our relationship with the Land of Israel] which is founded upon righteousness and intellectual sensitivity and awe of heaven, in any form, but only that aspect which wishes to deny the secrets and their great influence upon the national spirit. This is a disaster against which we must battle, with counsel and understanding, with sanctity and with might.\n",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "The most whole and sweet understanding of knowing the divine is recognizing the divine relation to the world overall and to each and every detail of its particulars, the physical and the spiritual, (it is) like the relation of the (higher) soul to the body – the spiritual side that sustains and fills the body (with the) light of persisting and flourishing, the matter necessary for life, light, and flourishing.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "When this relation is filled in the heart and the psyche, it fills them with love more than fear, pleasantness of contemplation and serenity more than bitterness of trembling. ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "The more refined school of thought’s cultural recognition proceeds very well in enhancing this sweet awareness.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "In the life of the individual it is easy to come to this quality through practical and intellectual ethical improvement and through elevating the light of knowledge in general.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "When human character relates with identification toward the exalted, toward the absolute good, in intellect and in life, immediately this (higher) soulful recognition of divinity immediately takes hold of it well, is absorbed in all of its ideas and merges with all its senses and feelings to refine them.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "The group organism has a unique psychology; if, in its depth, it too will be inclined to identify with exalted morality, and love of the noble good will be well engraved in its essential nature, either according to its free-choice or according to its heritage, then this (higher) soulful recognition will also penetrate well into the innards of the nation, and the pleasantness of the love of the divine (combined) with awe of exaltedness will be sweet and proper, steeped in the whole of the nation, and will straighten all its ways.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "However, according to the collective’s measure of psychological distance from affection for absolute goodness, so too the (higher) soulful relation to the divine will not be able to penetrate within it, and of necessity the connection to divinity within it will be a foreign connection, and the Lord will be to it a foreign and strange god, and this foreign god will acquire strange and caricature-like qualities that twist life much more than they can straighten it.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 7_Paragraph": "For now civilization has still not come to this characteristic of establishing divine identification with absolute goodness in the depth of the (higher) soul of group organisms, and therefore we still see in them signs of evil and tyranny and the essence of morality progressively fades and is abandoned from the collective heart of the groups.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 8_Paragraph": "But humanity has an heirloom refuge in the Congregation of Israel: identification with the divine is found in her inner circle. ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 9_Paragraph": "Feeling testifies and understanding clarifies that the single and unique Lord of the world is complete goodness, life, light, everything, exalted above everything, and better than every good, is good to all and His compassion is upon all His works, He sustains and watches over all, makes salvation sprout for all; and this overall identification not only permeates this nation’s individuals, but specifically (permeates) her as a collective. ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 10_Paragraph": "If it happened that she forgot her (higher) soul, the source of her life, she was gifted with prophecy to remind her, and exiles were prepared for her to straighten her crookedness until ultimately identification with absolute goodness would win within her.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 11_Paragraph": "This living tangible thirst that fills practical life, including societal and national (life), with its light and the essential strength of its existence – just as it fills them with metaphysical and visionary energies – it proceeds to pave its way, and calls to the nation at its time to be encouraged, to be uplifted, to shake off the dust of its lowliness, to break the chains of exile, and to demand new flourishing in the Land upon which the culture of the divine (higher) soul began to form, for the sake of the nation and for the sake of the entire world.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 0_Chapter, 12_Paragraph": "And the demand for closeness with the divine is not revealed in all its light at the beginning; just the opposite: it first appears in a negative way, in driving away the alien feelings about divinity that do not fill the psyche in relation to the (higher) soul but rather with the rule of a harsh master and a power of violence that come from the names of the baalim (an idolatry) lacking the refined light of awe of elevation and the pure and holy love of acceptance of the kingdom of heaven that is stamped on Israel, “the offspring of Abraham, my love;” and according to the strengthening of negation in the hands of those so inclined, so too progresses and comes the strength of the positive from the great camp that is like the camp of the Lord, from the heads of the people, those whose (higher) soul is from the world of Atzilut; and the divine nationalistic (higher) soulful feeling continually blossoms and connects with all the events hidden in perceptible history, which in their brilliance stand out in the subject of that history; this is the inherited Land, a desirable Land, a Land of holiness, a Land of beauty and a Land of life, “Our Redeemer, God of hosts is His name, The Holy One of Israel.”",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "Nature finds its dominance more in human collectives than in it individuals.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "Individuals are more free and the type of freedom unique to humanity is more visible in them. ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "But society, human and national, is more under the influence of nature, and (the role of) instinct is more visible in it.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "The ways of preservation intended for the preservation of the species and the individual, which appear in instinctive animals more than in civilized man - they are revealed in human collectives in ways closer to the animal nature. ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "The inner recognition, which includes the inclination to be on guard against any threat and to recognize the enemy, without any need for wisdom or experience, is revealed in the lives of nations, religions, and races in relation to one another.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "Idolatry sensed in Israel, in Judaism, its greatest enemy, such that as much it would be seen the world would be distressed by it, and from all the nations would go out instinctive hatred for Israel.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "Christianity, even though it tried to separate itself from official idolatry, was nevertheless based on foundations close to idolatry. It would not have been able to permeate within the idolatrous nations, in which idolatry had penetrated the insides of their (higher) soul, their blood, and their flesh, except by taking for itself an idolatrous style for its pursuit and spreading of its style.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 7_Paragraph": "It knows well that if the idolatrous style padding it should melt and come to an end it would not find legitimacy in life for its unique currency and it would be forced to be absorbed into Judaism, its source; therefore, it defends itself and is full of deathly hatred toward Judaism and for Israel who uphold Judaism. And so it goes on all roads and in all situations. ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 8_Paragraph": "The existential war makes its way in the physical world and in the spiritual world, in the world of opinions and of ideas. With full force and inner awareness it (the existential war) teaches many groups, an uneducated multitude, to defend themselves in their spiritual position, just as it teaches this instruction to individual animals and to human collectives in their material position.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 9_Paragraph": "Only after these inclinations move into life and have powerful effects, do philosophers come, investigators of the psyche and the nature of nations, and reveal the wisdom of the instinctive awareness advanced by the multitude, which follows its feelings and opinion, and accordingly paves its way in life. Investigation will refine the natural inclinations and as much as possible will give them a civilized and moral form, but it will not uproot them from their place, because they are stronger than it, and justice and righteousness are by their side. For, behold, they sustain collective life, and as long as there is merit in the continued existence of the national and societal group in whatever shape it takes, it has the right to protect its existence from anything that would swallow it, and with cunning it will wage war.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 10_Paragraph": "With natural awareness Judaism also recognizes herself – before any philosophy or any logic explain to her what she is – the illumination of divinity in the most pure and shining form deep within her and in the world and in life overall, and fulfilling this national model according to her independent spirit in her historic homeland, this is her whole aim. Her practical systems come to do the work of the channels through which will be fulfilled the relationship of the flow of the abundance of the dew of life from the pure divine ideal to her national ideal, in spirit, intellect, and action, not only in the life of every individual, but especially in the life of the whole nation.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 11_Paragraph": "In the world there are pious people, philosophers, holy people, people of the Lord, but there is no nation in the world whose essential (higher) soul can only be fulfilled in accordance with the goal of the sublime divine ideal in the world, except for Israel.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 12_Paragraph": "She must have a different spirit than the spirits of all the nations under the heavens and a unique sustenance appropriate to her that supports her and upholds her strength and provides her existence. Accordingly, Judaism cannot only rely on the ordinary nourishment of civilization, for it does not contain within it those parts from which her spiritual body is built.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 13_Paragraph": "In that from a fundamental perspective she differs from the spirit of all other nations, this does not in any way nullify the human side in which she is equal to all humanity, and in this way her spiritual side requires cultural nourishment like all the spiritual nourishment of all humanity in this field. However, this nourishment will not satisfy her need for the sustenance that is unique to her.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 14_Paragraph": "And if you should see a foreign spirit coming to transfer her from her source of unique life and to incline her toward satisfaction with the general nourishment, and all the more so if with powerful and decisive negation that spirit would negate her nourishment that is unique for strengthening her spirit and supporting the foundation of her existence, know that an enemy has stood up against her, and with all the might of her inner strength she will defend herself.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 15_Paragraph": "The divine good inside her and in the world that will be revealed through her full dwelling in her Land, this is her ideal characteristic. ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 16_Paragraph": "Independent creation and investigation that increasingly shines are esteemed branches of this ideal characteristic of hers, but these two will only be able to reach their heights with her when her sublime spirit is protected within her according to her unique nature, which is exalted above every human creation, every investigation, and every vision of the heart, like the elevation of heaven over the earth and like the elevation of the Lord’s thoughts and ways over man’s thoughts and ways.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 17_Paragraph": "When she preserves the tactics that according to her character bring the nature of her spirit to health, these being of Judaism’s ways in life, in the nation overall in every official and public way and in individuals according to the way most effectively absorbed in their education and their opinions, then creativity and independent investigation will find a broad and safe expanse within her.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 18_Paragraph": "And as long as she is secure in her unique nourishment she will know for sure that the general sustenance will return to her for blessing, for she needs it no less than every nation, and maybe even more in proportion to her spiritual elevation.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 19_Paragraph": "When the impetuous come and ridicule her spirit, and maliciously kick the tactics of her life, she is shocked and knows that for her it is a time of distress.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 20_Paragraph": "The question as to the essence and the value of the natural recognition (behind) this distress’s thinking, understandably, cannot be answered by the multitude that feels, but rather by people of heart who understand the content of the vision. ",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 21_Paragraph": "It (the nation) longs for the fulfillment of it nature; this fulfillment also requires independent creativity and investigation in the fullest sense; yet it sees that those destroyers that have become like outsiders; they cause her – she is forced in order to defend her unique spirit – to shutter windows against the external light of creativity and investigation that has not been completely clarified as fitting her inner spirit, because in the name of this creativity and investigation these combatants are coming to erase her likeness.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 22_Paragraph": "And if we would even say that we will not be able to inherit absolute victory with this way of constricted preservation alone, behold, a man will give everything he has for his life.",
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 3_Lights of Rebirth, 1_Chapter, 23_Paragraph": "But those who are truly filled with a spirit of courage at a time of crisis like this must announce and explain that the tactics of the holy life – the Torah and Mitzvah – are full of the spirit of the nation and store within them the power of its life with its unique character; they are also the most certain basis for freedom of creativity and investigation as well as for the blossoming of the nation and the recognition of her ideals, her revival and her building.\n",
        "2_Seeds, 4_Suffering Cleanses, 0_Paragraph": "All the conflicts of opinion amongst people and all the internal contradictions that each individual suffers in his thoughts come only from the mental fog in one's thought of the divine, which is an endless sea and all the thoughts, whether practical or theoretical, arise from and return to.",
        "2_Seeds, 4_Suffering Cleanses, 1_Paragraph": "One must always bear in mind the thought, which will be clear without the dross of false imaginations, of false fears, of bad qualities, of herds and disadvantages. The belief of God affirms human beings only as the same degree that divine greatness is explored and learned from that important part of them, which it deserves. Then the soul shines from the upper light by joining love and a complete view of life, and all feelings, opinions and actions are noted. As this fundamental element grows in the soul's innards, so too will grow the action that will act as a divine adherence to emotion and with the admiration of the heart to conduct the whole course of life in a straightforward manner."
