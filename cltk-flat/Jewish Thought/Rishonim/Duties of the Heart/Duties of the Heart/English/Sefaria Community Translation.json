        "1_First Treatise on Unity, 1_, 9_Chapter, 49_Paragraph": "Since it is not possible for our intellects to grasp His true nature, when referring to His glorious essence the scripture describes Him as the G-d of the choicest of His creations, rational or otherwise. Therefore, when Moshe Rabeinu asked G-d \"when the Israelites ask me what is His name, what should I answer them?\", G-d answered him: \"so shall you say to the descendants of Israel: 'Ehe-ye' sent me to you'\". And since G-d knew that the Israelites would not understand the true nature of this name (Ehe-ye), He added an explanation and said: \"thus should you say to the Israelites: \"The L-ord, the G-d of your forefathers, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, and the G-d of Jacob sent me to you, this is My name forever and this is My remembrance for every generation (Ex. 3:15)\".",
        "4_Fourth Treatise on Trust, 1_, 0_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "But the essence of \"trust\" is the emotional surety of the truster that her / his heart can depend upon the trustee to do what is good and correct for the truster--in the eyes of the trustee and according to the ability and knowledge of the trustee--to cause good for the truster."
