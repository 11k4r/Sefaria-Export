        "6_[Treatise VI] The Soul and Death, 5_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "And afterwards, I will speak about the end of the days of [a person's] life: And I say that the Creator of [the body and the soul] placed a measure of specific days to their combination. This is like (Exodus 23:26), \"I will fill the count of your days.\" And He said to some prophets (Deuteronomy 31:14), \"Here, your days are drawing near to die\"; and to others (II Samuel 7:12), \"When your days are filled,\" and that which is similar to this. And afterwards I say that there are times when He adds to this measure, knowing that the soul will remain [longer] with the body - given that his knowledge is no different than the truth about something. However this measure, for me, which absorbs the increase or reduction [in years] is the measure of strength that He gave to the body. And that is that - from the beginning, when He created him - there is no doubt that He built him with a specific strength, be it great or little. And the measure of the endurance of this strength is what is called the end (<i>ketz</i>). But He is able to add to him and strengthen him - such that with the seventy [years, on average,] He can establish thirty [more] years - and He is [also] able to weaken him and make him wilt, so that he wilts (dies) at forty. And according to this explanation, we can understand the addition to the end of the days [of a person], and the shortening of the life that there would be for a person; beyond the increase or reduction that His Creator knew [his natural strength] would bear in truth (naturally). And the explanation of this is that He knows that the root strength of the body (on average) is seventy years, and he may [then] add thirty years to it, or subtract thirty. And what is the source that obligates this reduction [or increase in years]? It is its statement (Proverbs 10:27), \"The fear of the Lord adds days.\" And it [also] stated about some of the righteous ones (II Kings 20:6), \"And I will add fifteen years to your days.\" And it states about many rewards, \"in order that your days will be lengthened,\" and that which is similar to it. And with the wicked, it stated (Exodus 12:29), \"and the Lord smote every firstborn in the Land of Egypt\"; \"And those that died in the plague were\" (Numbers 25:9), and that which is similar to it. And if they died according to the strength of their [natural] end, the plague would not have been on account of their sin, nor would the plague have been stopped on account of Pinchas' deed . And the prophet already distinguished the plague from the end of [a person's days], when he said (I Samuel 26:10), \"the Lord will strike him with a plague, or his day will come and he will die.\" But I am not saying that they add to the life of every righteous person, or that they subtract from every wicked person. Rather it is according to the choice of the Creator and according to the good [done by the person]. And [for] the righteous ones whose lives were not increased, the reward of the world to come is before him. And [for] the wicked ones whose lives were not shortened, the punishment of the world to come is before him. It is as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 3:1), \"and there is a time for everything,\""
