Afterwards take the bitter herbs (<i>marror</i>), the <i>karpas</i>, the shankbone and the egg and place them upon the three matzot - the shankbone which hints to kindness (<i>chesed</i>) on your right, the egg on your left; and the bitter herbs, which hint to harmony, 'extend from end to end' in the middle, between the shankbone and the egg. In other books - because harmony (<i>tiferet</i>) is what mediates between kindness and might (<i>gevurah</i>). And the <i>charoset</i> is on the right, below the shankbone in the right column, corresponding to victory (<i>netzach</i>). And place the <i>karpas</i>, which hints to splendor (<i>hod</i>), below the egg on the left in the left column. And place the horseradish below the bitter herbs in the middle column, to make the sandwich later on, and that corresponds to foundation (<i>yesod</i>). And the plate itself, which includes them all, corresponds to majesty (<i>malkhut</i>).",

The sawing is the following:  it is to give the sawing all the judgment, with mercy only remaining. And the judgment is sweetened with various sweets (that we will explain further below).  The sawing occurs in these ten days.  Each day, one of the attributes are sawed.  It is known that the head of the [female-energy called] Nukvah is back-to-back with his chest and from there and above is the place called Leah, as it is known that his pairing with her happens during these days.  Rachel is not fully sawed (separated) until Yom Kippur and does not couple until Shmini Atzeret.",
