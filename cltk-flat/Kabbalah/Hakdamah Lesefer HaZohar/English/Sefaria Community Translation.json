        "5_Section": "Our Rabbi's have taught us, that the reason for God creating the world is to benefit and give enjoyment to His creatures. This should be our focus, because this is God's thought and purpose in creating the world. And we should realize, that the enjoyment that a person receives is in direct proportion, to the person's desire for that enjoyment. The greater the desire, the greater the enjoyment. (Translators note: Receiving a penny, brings no enjoyment, because there is no desire for a penny. Receiving $1,000 brings with it great enjoyment, because of the great desire). As part of God's plan in creating the world, He had to create a great desire within the soul, within the person. If there is no desire, there is no enjoyment.", 
        "4_Section": "Therefore, a clear thinking individual must come to the realization, opposite to what appears on the surface, and conclude, that we are creatures of the highest order, worthy of representing the One who created us. For every fault that we may have, after exhausting all excuses, the only one to blame is God Himself, for He created us with all our bad traits; we did not create ourselves. Also, He can foresee all the outcomes that these bad traits wrought, those traits that He imparted in us. But as we had said, we must look at the final result, only then can we have an understanding. As people say: \"Don't show a fool an item before it is completed\". ", 
        "2_Section": "Fourth Inquiry: Since evil (the \"other side\", and the \"shells\") are distanced from God's holiness an infinite distance, how is it possible that evil emanates from God Himself, and not only that, but also that God sustains evil. Fifth Inquiry: The matter of resurrection of the dead. Since the body is finite and from the moment of birth, the end result will be death and burial; and not only that, but the Zohar says, that the body has to completely rot before the soul can enter Eden, why the need for the resurrection of the dead. Couldn't God just delight the soul, without the body? And more perplexing, is that which is written, that at the resurrection of the dead, God will resurrect each body with the defect that it had before death, so that no one should say, \"this is not the same person that died\", and only later will God heal that person from their prior defect. Why should God care so much what other people say, to the point that He has to resurrect the dead with all their defects, and only later heal them. Sixth Inquiry: That which is stated in the Zohar (Tazriah 40), and also in Tractate Sanhedrin (37a) that all of reality, our solar system, all the billions of galaxies, all the spiritual worlds, were made for even just one person, since each person is the center of the universe. It is difficult to understand, how a person whose worth appears to be so small as compared to all of reality, how can he be the center of the universe? And especially when we compare man to the spiritual worlds, that have no boundaries. Why would God create all these worlds, the physical and the spiritual, just for man? What benefit is there to man, from all this?", 
        "0_Section": " In this introduction to the Zohar I would like to explain certain ideas that many have touched upon, a lot has been written on, but still its depths has not been perceived. My first question: a) what is our essence? b) what is our role in this reality, that each of us is a small link? c) when we look around us, we see that humanity has many faults, but when we think about the creator we must assume that he is the most complete; then why would a complete manufacturer (creator), create a faulty product? d) why would a loving creator, create people, many of whom suffer throughout their lives, shouldn't a complete creator create goodness, and especially not create pain? e) how is it possible that from an eternal creator, people are created, that end and are gone.   ", 
        "3_Section": "In order to try to find answers to these questions and inquiries, our strategy must be to look at the end result! In other words, to the goal of creation. For it is not possible to understand anything, if we only observe the manufacturing process without seeing the final product. And it is obvious that there is no worker that doesn't work towards a goal. For only a deranged person works with no goal in mind. I know, however, that there are philosophers, those who do not follow the torah and mitzvoth, who say that it is true that God created the world, but he has removed Himself from it, due to the lowly nature of people, since it is not befitting God to associate Himself with such lowly creatures. However, they have not thought this through. Because had we created ourselves, then we can say that we have all these bad traits. But once we decide that the Creator who is complete, He created us, with all that is good about us, and all of our faults, we must realize that a high level manufacturer (God) only produces high level products (people), and every product reflects the quality of the producer. It is not the fault of an inferior suit, if it was produced by a lousy tailor, why should the suit be blamed. This is similar to the story (Tractate Taanit 20b) about Rabbi Elazar who happened to come across an exceedingly ugly person, when told by Rabbi Elazar that he is very ugly, answered back: \"go and tell the craftsman that made me, how ugly is the vessel that you made\". Imagine if you came across a person, who would create people who suffer all their lives, and not only that, but would forsake them, and not try to help them even a tiny amount, how much scorn who you pour on such a person! Is it possible to even imagine this about God, who is the positive force of the universe!  ", 
        "1_Section": "And in order to completely clarify all this, we must initially make some inquires (about the creator) not in areas that we are forbidden to discuss, in other words about the Creator's essence, which we have no knowledge what so ever. But in an area where we do have some knowledge of God, that is in His actions. As it says: \"Know the God of your forefathers, and worship Him\". And it is also written, in the \"Shir HaYichud\": \"You (God) are known through your actions\". The first inquiry is: How is it possible for God to create something from nothing, \"ex nihilo\" for everyone knows that raw materials are needed to create any product. And also, since God is the creator, creation did not come from \"nothing\", it came from God. Second inquiry: Even if we acknowledge, that it is in God's power to even create \"something from nothing\", in other words, something completely new, not found in God Himself; what exactly is that \"something\" that God created from \"nothing\". Third inquiry: What the Kabbalists say that the soul of man, is a \"part of God Himself\" in that there is no difference between the soul  and God, just that God in the \"whole\" and the soul in a \"part\" (of God). And they compared this to a stone separated from a mountain. However, the stone is separated from the mountain by a tool used for that purpose. But what is the \"tool\" that separates the soul from God Himself. In other words, at what point is it called \"soul\" and not God Himself."
