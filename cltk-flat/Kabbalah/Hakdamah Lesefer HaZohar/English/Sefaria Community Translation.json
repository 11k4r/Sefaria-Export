        "1_Section": "And in order to completely clarify all this, we must initially make some inquires (about the creator) not in areas that we are forbidden to discuss, in other words about the Creator's essence, which we have no knowledge what so ever. But in an area where we do have some knowledge of God, that is in His actions. As it says: \"Know the God of your forefathers, and worship Him\". And it is also written, in the \"Shir HaYichud\": \"You (God) are known through your actions\". The first inquiry is: How is it possible for God to create something from nothing, \"ex nihilo\" for everyone knows that raw materials are needed to create any product. And also, since God is the creator, creation did not come from \"nothing\", it came from God. Second inquiry: Even if we acknowledge, that it is in God's power to even create \"something from nothing\", in other words, something completely new, not found in God Himself; what exactly is that \"something\" that God created from \"nothing\". Third inquiry: What the Kabbalists say that the soul of man, is a \"part of God Himself\" in that there is no difference between the soul  and God, just that God in the \"whole\" and the soul in a \"part\" (of God). And they compared this to a stone separated from a mountain. However, the stone is separated from the mountain by a tool used for that purpose. But what is the \"tool\" that separates the soul from God Himself. In other words, at what point is it called \"soul\" and not God Himself.", 
        "0_Section": " In this introduction to the Zohar I would like to explain certain ideas that many have touched upon, a lot has been written on, but still its depths has not been perceived. My first question: a) what is our essence? b) what is our role in this reality, that each of us is a small link? c) when we look around us, we see that humanity has many faults, but when we think about the creator we must assume that he is the most complete; then why would a complete manufacturer (creator), create a faulty product? d) why would a loving creator, create people, many of whom suffer throughout their lives, shouldn't a complete creator create goodness, and especially not create pain? e) how is it possible that from an eternal creator, people are created, that end and are gone.
