        "0_Seif": "Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana said: One verse (Job 37:21) states, \"...one cannot see the sun, Though it be bright in the heavens,...\" Another verse, however, (Ps. 18:12), states, \"He made darkness His screen...\" It is also written (Psalms.97.2), \"Dense clouds are around Him...\" This is an apparent contradiction. A third verse comes and reconciles the two. It is written (Ps. 139:12), \"darkness is not dark for You; night is as light as day; darkness and light are the same.\" ",
        "1_Seif": "Rabbi Berachiah said: It is written (Gen. 1:2), \"the earth being <i>tohu</i> (unformed) and <i>bohu</i> (void).\" What is the meaning of the word \"was\" in this verse? This indicates that the <i>tohu</i> existed previously. What is <i>tohu</i>? Something that confounds (<i>taha</i>) people. What is <i>bohu</i>? It is something that has substance. This is the reason that it is called \"<i>bohu</i>\", that is, \"<i>bo hu</i>\" - \"it is in it.\"",
        "2_Seif": "Why does the Torah begin with the letter <i>Bet</i>? In order that it begin with a <i>berachah</i> (blessing). How do we know that the Torah is called a blessing? Because it is written (Deut. 33:23), \"And full of the LORD’s blessing, Take possession on the west and south.\" The Sea is nothing other than the Torah, as it is written (Job 11:9), \"Its measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea.\" What is the meaning of the verse, \"full of the LORD’s blessing\"? This means that wherever we find the letter <i>bet</i> it indicates a blessing. It is thus written (Gen. 1:1), \"<i><u>Be</u>reshit</i>...\" (\"<u>In</u> the beginning\") The word <i>reshit</i> (\"beginning\") is nothing other than Wisdom. It is thus written (Ps. 111:10), \"The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD;\" Wisdom is a blessing. It is thus written, that, the LORD blessed Solomon. It is furthermore written (I Kings 5:26), \"The LORD had given Solomon wisdom\". This resembles a king who marries his daughter to his son. He gives her to him at the wedding and says to him, \"Do with her as you desire.\"",
        "3_Seif": "How do we know that the word <i>berachah</i>  comes from the word <i>baruch</i> (\"bless\")? Perhaps it comes from the word <i>berech</i>! (\"knee\") It is written (Is. 45:23), \"To Me every knee shall bend.\" The Place to which every knee bends. What example does this resemble? People want to see the king, but do not know where to find his <i>bayit</i> (\"house\"). First they ask \"Where is the king's house?\" Only then can they ask \"Where is the king?\" It is thus written, \"To Me every knee shall bend.\" - even the highest - \"Every tongue swear loyalty.\"",
        "4_Seif": "Rabbi Rahumai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (Deut 33:23), \"And full of the LORD’s blessing, Take possession on the west and south.\"? This means that wherever we find the letter <i>bet</i>, it is blessed. This is the Filling referred to in the verse, \"And full of the LORD’s blessing\" From there it nourishes those who need it. It was from this Filling that God sought advice. What example does this resemble? A king wanted to build his palace among great cliffs. He mined into the bedrock and uncovered a great spring of living water. The king then said, \"Since I have flowing water, I will plant a garden. Then I will delight in it, and so will all the world.\" It is therefore written (Pro. 8:30), \"I was with Him as a confidant, A source of delight every day, Rejoicing before Him at all times,\" The Torah is saying, \"For two thousand years I was in the bosom of the Blessed Holy One as His delight.\" The verse therefore says, \"every day\" Each day of the Blessed Holy One is a thousand years, as it is written (Ps. 90:4), \"For in Your sight a thousand years are like yesterday that has passed, like a watch of the night.\" From then on, it is at times, as the verse states, \"Rejoicing before Him at all times\" The rest is for the world. It is thus written (Is. 48:9), \"I control My wrath; To My own glory,\" What is the meaning of \"My own glory\"? As it is written (Ps. 145:1), \"A song of praise. Of David. I will extol You...\" Why is this a praise? Because \"I will extol You\". And what is this extolling? Because \"Every day will I bless You and praise Your name forever and ever.\" [Ps. 145:2]",
        "5_Seif": "What is a blessing? It can be explained with an example: A king planted trees in his garden. It may rain and water them, and the ground may be wet and provide them with moisture, but still, he must water them from the spring. It is thus written (Ps. 111:10), \"The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; all who practice it gain sound understanding...\" You may think that it lacks something. It is therefore written, \"Praise of Him is everlasting.\"",
        "6_Seif": "Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (Deut. 33:23), \"And full of the LORD’s blessing, Take possession on the west and south.\" Moses was saying, \"If you follow my decrees, you will inherit both this world and the next.\" The World to Come is likened to the sea, as it is written (Job 11:9), \"And broader than the sea.\" The present world is referred to as the South. It is thus written (Josh. 15:19), \"...for you have given me away as Negeb-land...\" The Targum translates this, \"behold the earth is the south.\"",
        "7_Seif": "Why did God add the letter <i>He</i> to Abraham's name, rather than any other letter? This was so that all parts of man's body should be worthy of life in the World to Come, which is likened to the sea. To the extent that we can express it, the Structure was completed in Abraham. It is written (Genesis 9:6), \"For in His image Did God make man.\" The numerical value of Abraham is 248, the number of organs in man's body.",
        "8_Seif": " What is the meaning of (Deut. 33:23), \"...take possession...\"? (<i>yerashah</i>) It would have been sufficient if the verse said, \"...inherit...\" (<i>rash</i>) But this comes to teach us that God must also be included. The word <i>yerashah</i> thus contains the letters <i>resh</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>yud</i>, and <i>he</i> [or, <i>rash Yah</i>: \"inherit God\"]. What does this resemble? A king had two treasuries, and he hid one away. After many days he said to his son, \"Take what is in these two treasuries.\" The son replied, \"Perhaps you are not giving me all that you have hidden away.\" The king said, \"Take everything.\" It is thus written, \"Take possession on the west and south.\" Inherit God (<i>rash Yah</i>) - everything will be given to you if you only keep My ways. ",
        "9_Seif": "Rabbi Bun said: What is the meaning of the verse (Proverbs 8:23), \"In the distant past I was fashioned, At the beginning, at the origin of earth.\" What is the meaning of \"in the distant past\"? (<i>m'Olam</i>) This means that it must be concealed (<i>he-elam</i>) from the world. It is thus written (Ecclesiastes 3:11), \"He also puts eternity (<i>ha-Olam</i>)  in their mind.\" Do not read <i>ha-Olam</i> (eternity), but <i>he-elam</i>. (concealment) The Torah said, \"I was first, so that I might be the head of the world.\" It is thus written, \"In the distant past I was fashioned, At the beginning,\" You may think that the earth was before it. It is therefore written, \"before the earth.\" It is thus written (Gen. 1:1), \"In the beginning, when God began to create heaven and earth\" What is the meaning of \"created\"? He created everything that was needed for all things, and then God, only after that is it written \"the heaven and the earth.\"",
        "10_Seif": "What is the meaning of the verse (Ecclesiastes 7:14), \"The one no less than the other was God’s doing\"? He created <i>bohu</i> and placed it in Peace, and He created <i>tohu</i> and placed it in Evil. Chaos is in Peace, as it is written (Job 25:2), \"He imposes peace in His heights.\" This teaches us that Michael, the prince to God's right, is water and hail, while Gabriel, the prince to God's left, is fire. The two are reconciled by the Prince of Peace. This is the meaning of the verse, \"He imposes peace in His heights.\"",
        "11_Seif": "How do we know that Chaos is in Evil? It is written (Isaiah 45:7), \"I make weal and create woe—\" How does this come out? Evil is from <i>tohu</i>, while Peace is from <i>bohu</i>. He thus created <i>tohu</i> and placed it in Evil, as it is written \"I make weal and create woe\" He created <i>bohu</i> and placed it in Peace, as it is written, \"He imposes peace in His heights.\"",
        "12_Seif": "Rabbi Bun also sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (Isaiah 45:7), \"I form light and create darkness,\" Light has substance. Therefore, the term \"form\" is used with regard to it. Darkness has no substance, and therefore, with regard to it, the term \"create\" is used. It is similarly written (Amos 4:12), \"He who formed the mountains, And created the wind,\" Another explanation is this: Light was actually brought into existence, as it is written (Gen. 1:3), \"God said, let there be light.\" Something cannot be brought into existence unless it is made. The term \"formed\" is therefore used. In the case of darkness, however, there was no 'making', only separation and setting aside. It is for this reason that the term \"created\" (<i>bara</i>) is used. It has the same sense as in the expression, \"That person became well (<i>hibri'a</i>).\"",
        "13_Seif": "Why is the letter <i>Bet</i> closed on all sides and open in the front? This teaches us that it is the House (<i>bayit</i>) of the world. God is the place of the world, and the world is not His place. Do not read<i>Bet</i>, but <i>Bayit</i> (house). It is thus written (Proverbs 24:3), \"A house is built by wisdom, And is established by understanding;\"",
        "14_Seif": "What does the <i>Bet</i> resemble? It is like a man, formed by God with wisdom. He is closed on all sides, but open in front. The <i>Aleph</i>, however, is open from behind. This teaches us that the tail of the <i>Bet</i> is open from behind. If not for this, man could not exist. Likewise, if not for the <i>Bet</i> on the tail of the <i>Aleph</i>, the world could not exist.",
        "15_Seif": "Rabbi Rahumai said: Illumination preceded the world. It is thus written (Gen. 1:3), \"God said, 'let there be light,' and there was light.\" They said to Him, \"Before the creation of Israel your son, will you then make him a crown?\" He replied yes. What does this resemble? A king yearned for a son. One day he found a beautiful, precious crown, and he said, \"This is fitting for my son's head.\" They said to him, \"Are you then certain that your son will be worthy of this crown?\" He replied, \"Be still. This is what arises in thought.\" It is thus written (2 Sam. 14:14), \"one who makes plans so that no one may be kept banished.\"",
        "16_Seif": "Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: Why is the letter <i>Aleph</i> at the beginning? Because it was before everything, even the Torah.",
        "17_Seif": "Why does <i>Bet</i> follow it? Because it was first. Why does it have a tail? To point to the place from which it came. Some say, from there the world is sustained.",
        "18_Seif": "Why is <i>Gimel</i> third? It has three parts, teaching us that it bestows kindness. (<i>gomel</i>) But did Rabbi Akiva not say that <i>Gimel</i> has three parts because it bestows, grows, and sustains? It is thus written (Gen. 21:8), \"The child grew up and was weaned,\" He said: He says the same as I do. He grew and bestowed kindness to his neighbours and to those entrusted to him.",
        "19_Seif": "And why is there a tail at the bottom of the <i>Gimel</i>? He said: The <i>Gimel</i> has a head on top, and is like a pipe. Just like a pipe, the <i>Gimel</i> draws from above through its head, and disperses through its tail. This is the <i>Gimel</i>.",
        "20_Seif": "Rabbi Yochanan said: The angels were created on the second day. It is therefore written (Ps. 104:3), \"He sets the rafters of His lofts in the waters, (makes the clouds His chariot, moves on the wings of the wind.)\" It is then written (Ps. 104:4), \"He makes the winds His messengers, fiery flames His servants.\" Rabbi Levatas ben Tavrus said: All agree, even Rabbi Yochanan, that the water already existed [on the first day]. But it was on the second day that \"He sets the rafters of His lofts in the waters,\" the one who \"makes the clouds his chariot,\" and the one who \"walks on the wings of the wind.\" But His messengers were not created until the fifth day.",
        "21_Seif": "All agree that none were created on the first day. It should therefore not be said that Michael drew out the heaven at the south, and Gabriel drew it out at the north, while God arranged things in the middle. It is thus written (Isaiah 44:24), \"It is I, the LORD, who made everything, Who alone stretched out the heavens And unaided spread out the earth before Me\" (before Me = <i>me'iti</i>) I am the One who planted this tree in order that all the world should delight in it. And in it, I spread All. I called it All because all depend upon it, all emanate from it, and all need it. To it they look, for it they wait, and from it, souls fly in joy. Alone was I when I made it. Let no angel rise above it and say, \"I was before you.\" I was also alone when I spread out My earth, in which I planted and rooted this tree. I made them rejoice together, and I rejoiced in them. \"Who was with Me?\" (with Me = <i>mi iti</i>) To whom have I revealed this mystery?",
        "22_Seif": "Rabbi Rahumai said: From your words we could conclude that the needs of this world were created before the heavens. He answered yes. What does this resemble? A king wanted to plant a tree in his garden. He searched the entire garden to find a spring flowing with water that would nourish the tree, but could not find any. He then said, \"I will dig for water, and will bring forth a spring to nourish the tree.\" He dug and opened a well, flowing with living water. He then planted the tree, and it stood, giving forth fruit. It was successfully rooted, since it was always watered from the well.",
        "23_Seif": "Rabbi Yanai said: The earth was created first, as it is written (Gen. 2:4), \"[...God made] earth and heaven.\" They said to him: Is it not written (Gen. 1:1), \"[God created] the heavens and the earth\"? He replied: What is this like? A king bought a beautiful object, but since it was not complete, he did not give it a name. He said, \"I will complete it, I will prepare its pedestal and attachment, and then I will give it a name.\" It is thus written (Ps. 102:26), \"Of old You established the earth; the heavens are the work of Your hands.\" It is furthermore written (Ps. 104:2-3), \"wrapped in a robe of light; You spread the heavens like a tent cloth, He sets the rafters of His lofts in the waters...\" It is then written (Ps. 104:4), \"He makes the winds His messengers, fiery flames His servants.\" Finally, it is written (Ps. 104:5), \"He established the earth on its foundations, so that it shall never totter.\" When He made its pedestal, He strengthened it. It is therefore written, \"that it not be moved.\" What is its name? \"And <i>Va'ed</i> (forever) is its name. And its pedestal is <i>Olam</i> (world). It is therefore written, \"for the World And Forever.\""
