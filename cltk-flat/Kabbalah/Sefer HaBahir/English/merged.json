        "10_Seif": "What is the meaning of the verse (Ecclesiastes 7:14), \"Also one opposite the other was made by God.\" He created Desolation and placed it in Peace, and He created Chaos and placed it in Evil. Desolation is in Peace, as it is written (Job 25:2), \"He makes peace in His high places.\" This teaches us that Michael, the prince to God's right, is water and hail, while Gabriel, the prince to God's left, is fire. The two are reconciled by the Prince of Peace. This is the meaning of the verse, \"He makes peace in His high places.\"", 
        "118_Seif": "And what would the tree be that you spoke of? He said to him: [It is] the powers/kochot of the Holy One, this on back of this, and they resemble/domin a tree: just as this tree, by means of the waters, brings out fruit, even so the Holy One by means of the waters increases the powers of the tree. And what are these waters of the Holy One? They are wisdom, and they are the souls/n’shamot of the righteous that bloom/grow/fly/por’chin from the spring unto the great channel. And he goes up and joins with the tree, and by what means does [the tree] bloom/grow? By means of Israel, [for] when they are righteous and good, Shekhinah rests among them, and through their deeds she rests in the bosom of the Holy One, and makes them fruitful and increases them.", 
        "30_Seif": "R’ Amorai said: Gan Eden, where is it? He said to them: In the earth.", 
        "23_Seif": "R’ Yanai said: The earth was created before the heavens, as it says, “[in the day of YHVH Elohim’s making] earth and heavens” [Gn 2:4]. They said to him: But isn’t it written, “[Elohim created] the heavens (first) and the earth”? He said to them: To what does the thing compare? To a king who took possession of a beautiful, precious thing, and it wasn’t complete . . . He said, “I will complete it and prepare its mounting and its setting, and then  I will call out its name over it . . . ”", 
        "22_Seif": "R’ R’chumai said: From your word we learn that the Holy One created the need of this world before the heavens. He said to him: Thus so. ", 
        "21_Seif": "... I am the one that planted this tree/ilan, [for] all the world to delight in, and I hammered out all/kol with him (the tree), and I called his name “the Whole/All /hakol”, for all depends on him, and all comes out from him. And all are needing him, and through/to him they gaze and for him they wait. And from there bloom/grow the souls in joy. Alone was I when I made him . . . for in the time when I hammered out my earth, I planted and rooted this tree in her, and I rejoiced together [with him] and I rejoiced in them.", 
        "95_Seif": "And corresponding to her (the earth) is the deep-blue/t’cheilet of the tsitsit (the corner fringes on a prayer shawl). For R’ Meir said: How is t’cheilet different from all kinds of colors? Because t’cheilet resembles the sea and the sea resembles the firmament and the firmament resembles the throne of glory, as it is said, “And they saw Israel’s God and under His feet [was something] like sapphire brick-work and like the essence of the heavens for purity” [Ex 24:10] and it says, “like the appearance/mar’eh of sapphire stone, a likeness of a throne / d’mut kisei’” [Ez 1:26]. ", 
        "3_Seif": "How do we know that the word \"Berachah\" comes from the word \"Baruch\"? Perhaps it comes from the word \"Berech\". It is written (Isaiah 44:23), \"For to Me shall every knee bend.\" Berachah - the Place to which every knee bends. What example does this resemble? People want to see the king, but do not know where to find his house. First they ask \"Where is the king's house?\" Only then can they ask \"Where is the king?  It is thus written, \"For to Me shall every knee bend\" -- even the highest -- \"every tongue shall swear.\"", 
        "9_Seif": "Rabbi Bun said: What is the meaning of the verse (Proverbs 8:23), \"I was set up from eternity from a head, before the earth?\" What is the meaning of \"from eternity?\" This means that it must be concealed from the world. It is thus written (Ecclesiastes 3:11), \"He has also placed the world in their hearts.\" Do not read 'the world', but 'concealment'. The Torah said, \"I was first, so that I might be the head of the world.\" It is thus written, \"I was set up from eternity, from a head.\" You may think that the earth was before it. It is therefore written, \"before the earth.\" It is thus written (Genesis 1:1), \"In the beginning created God the heaven and the earth.\" What is the meaning of \"created\"? He created everything that was needed for all things. And then God. Only after that is it written \"the heaven and the earth.\"", 
        "8_Seif": "What is the meaning of (Deuteronomy 33:23), \"[The filling is God's blessing, the Sea and the South] he shall inherit it?\" It would have been sufficient if the verse said, \"inherit\" But this comes to teach us that God must also be included. The word YiRaShaH thus contains the letters RaSh YH [meaning, \"inherit God\"]. What does this resemble? A king had two treasuries, and he hid one away. After many days he said to his son, \"Take what is in these two treasuries.\" The son replied, \"Perhaps you are not giving me all that you have hidden away.\" The king said, \"Take everything.\" It is thus written, \"the Sea and the South, he shall inherit it.\" Inherit God -- everything will be given to you if you only keep My ways.", 
        "6_Seif": "Rabbi Amorai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (Deuteronomy 33:23), \"The filling is God's blessing, possessing the Sea and the South?\" Moses was saying, \"If you follow my decrees, you will inherit both this world and the next.\" The World to Come is likened to the sea, as it is written (Job 11:9), \"It is wider than the sea.\" The present world is referred to as the South. It is thus written (Joshua 15:19), \"for you have set me in the land of the south, give me springs of water.\" The Targum translates this, \"behold the earth is the south.\"", 
        "5_Seif": "What is a blessing? It can be explained with an example. A king planted trees in his garden. It may rain and water them, and the ground may be wet and provide them with moisture, but still, he must water them from the spring. It is thus written (Psalm 111:10), \"The beginning is Wisdom, the fear of God, good intelligence to all who do them.\" You may think that it lacks something. It is therefore written, \"His praise endures forever.\"", 
        "4_Seif": "Rabbi Rahumai sat and expounded: What is the meaning of the verse (Deuteronomy 33:23), \"The filling is God's blessing, possessing the Sea and the South\"? This means that wherever we find the letter Bet it is blessed. This is the Filling referred to in the verse, \"The filling is God's blessing.\" From there it nourishes those who need it. It was from this Filling that God sought advice. What example does this resemble? A king wanted to build his palace among great cliffs. He mined into the bedrock and uncovered a great spring of living water. The king then said, \"Since I have flowing water, I will plant a garden. Then I will delight in it, and so will all the world.\" It is therefore written (Proverbs 8:30), \"I was with Him as a craftsman, I was His delight for a day, a day, frolicking before him at every time.\" The Torah is saying, \"For two thousand years I was in the bosom of the Blessed Holy One as His delight.\" The verse therefore says, \"a day, a day.\" Each day of the Blessed Holy One is a thousand years, as it is written (Psalm 90:4), \"A thousand years in Your eyes is as but yesterday when it is passed.\" From then on, it is at times, as the verse states, \"at every time.\" The rest is for the world. It is thus written (Isaiah 48:9), \"I will My praise through My nose for you.\" What is the meaning of \"My praise\"? As it is written (Psalm 145:2), \"A praise of David, I will raise You high\" Why is this a praise? Because I will \"raise You high.\" And what is this elevation? Because \"I will bless Your name for the world and forever.\"", 
        "94_Seif": "... “The advantage/profit/surplus/yitron of the land/arets over All /bakol is a king” [Ec 5:8] – And what is yitron? A place from which is carved out the earth/arets . . . And what is this “earth”? That from her was carved out the Whole /hakol, and from him (hakol) was carved out heavens, and he is the throne of the Holy One, and he is a precious stone, and he is the sea of wisdom. ", 
        "2_Seif": "Why does the Torah begin with the letter Bet? In order that it begin with a blessing (Berachah). How do we know that the Torah is called a blessing? Because it is written (Deuteronomy 33:23), \"The filling is God's blessing possessing the Sea and the South.\" The Sea is nothing other than the Torah, as it is written (Job 11:9), \"It is wider than the sea.\" What is the meaning of the verse, \"The filling is God's blessing?\" This means that wherever we find the letter Bet it indicates a blessing. It is thus written (Genesis 1:1), \"In the beginning\". The word \"beginning\"is nothing other than Wisdom. It is thus written (Psalm 111:10), \"The beginning is wisdom, the fear of God.\" Wisdom is a blessing. It is thus written, \"And God blessed Solomon.\" It is furthermore written (I Kings 5:26), \"And God gave Wisdom to Solomon.\" This resembles a king who marries his daughter to his son. He gives her to him at the wedding and says to him, \"Do with her as you desire.\"", 
        "1_Seif": "Rabbi Berachiah said: It is written (Genesis 1:2), \"The earth was Chaos and Desolation. What is the meaning of the word \"was\" in this verse? This indicates that the Chaos existed previously. What is Chaos? Something that confounds people. What is Desolation? It is something that has substance. This is the reason that it is called \"Bohu\", that is, \"Bo Hu\" -- \"it is in it.\"", 
        "0_Seif": "Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana said: One verse (Job 37:21) states, \"And now they do not see light, it is brilliant in the skies...\" Another verse, however, (Psalm 18:12), states, \"He made darkness His hiding place.\" It is also written (Psalm 97:2), \"Cloud and gloom surround Him.\" This is an apparent contradiction. A third verse comes and reconciles the two. It is written (Psalm 139:12), \"Even darkness is not dark to You. Night shines like day — light and darkness are the same.\"", 
        "7_Seif": "Why did God add the letter Heito Abraham's name, rather than any other letter? This was so that all parts of man's body should be worthy of life in the World to Come, which is likened to the sea. To the extent that we can express it, the Structure was completed in Abraham. It is written (Genesis 9:6), \"For in the form of God, He made the man.\" The numerical value of Abraham is 248, the number of parts in man's body."
