        "15_Chukat, 0_Paragraph": "And they set out from Hor Hahar through the way of the Sea of Reeds. That is that the group stopped studying the Talmud, which is called Hor HaHar. Why is it called Hor HaHar? Because from there comes teaching [hora'ah] to the world, as \"I have written to instruct them [lehorotam]\" (Exodus 24:12) - and this is the Oral Torah [Mishnah, Talmud and Midrash].", 
        "15_Chukat, 11_Paragraph": "When Israel returned in teshuvah then they sang a song. And those are the seven levels that they returned with their song, and the higher well was raised high, and the snake disappeared from the world. This is what is written \"Then Israel sang\" (Numbers 21:17) \"raise well, answer to it\", and the lower mother [malchut, our reality] is infused with the higher mother [binah, understanding]", 
        "24_Tikkunim Mizohar Chadash, 1_Paragraph": "One who carefully guards himself against giving in to anger and avoids any arguments, merits that his home is compared to the holy Temple. (Zohar)", 
        "22_Midrash Rut, 33_Paragraph": "The Holy Blessed One said to him [the angel]: This is why I created the heaven, so Eliyahu could go there!' The Angel of Death said to the Master of the World: 'Now You have given other creatures an opening [to avoid death].\" The Holy Blessed One replied: 'Eliyahu is not like other creatures. He could remove you [Death] from the world and you do not know his strength.' The Angel of Death said, 'Master of the World, grant me permission and I will descend upon him.' He said 'Go down.' And he immediately descended. But Eliyahu saw him, forced him under his leg, and [Eliyahu] asked to be able to remove him from the world, but God did not grant him permission. Immediately, Eliyahu flipped him and ascended [alive] to heaven.", 
        "15_Chukat, 2_Paragraph": "And they [Israel] went left her and on her way, and went after the way of the snake Akalton, which reigns in the land of Edom, so it says \"the soul of the people became smaller in the way\" this is because they left the way of life, and so they \"spoke against God and Moshe\" [Moshe represents the Shechinah]. They rejected all: the Oral Torah and the Written Torah. \"There is no bread\" - this is the Oral Torah. \"There is no water\" - this is the written Torah. And this is \"kelokel bread\" - the words of the Oral Torah were light [kal] in their eyes.", 
        "23_Midrash HaNe'elam Al Eichah, 0_Paragraph": "1. The Jewish community of Babylon sent a message to the Jewish community of the Holy Land, \"It is appropriate for us to cry, it is appropriate for us to eulogize the destruction of the house of God, so much so that the we have been scattered amongst the nations, we should begin to euglogize, to explain the verses in order (from the book of Lamentations), that the master of the world sent in order to eulogize the destruction of His house. ", 
        "15_Chukat, 10_Paragraph": "Come and see how great is the strength of teshuvah (return) over all that there is, because when a person returns to her Source then the well of living waters is replenished to the brim, and from all its sides [water] from the core comes out, and the twelve gates of a person are drenched from smallness of living with largeness of living. ", 
        "15_Chukat, 1_Paragraph": "But come and see: there is a vision of wisdom in here. The place called Hor HaHar its way was near the Sea of Reeds, the end of the steps/levels, that she [the Shechinah] was speaking in front of them in the desert, and taught them the ways of life, to go above the present world.", 
        "24_Tikkunim Mizohar Chadash, 0_Paragraph": "Three people are especially beloved by G-d: One who does not lose control of his temper, one who does not become drunk, and one who does not demand his full rights.  (Pesachim 113a)", 
        "22_Midrash Rut, 32_Paragraph": "And it is written: 'And Eliyahu went up to heaven in a whirlwind.' (II Kings 2:11). Rabbi Nechemiah and Rabbi Yehudah say: 'when the Holy Blessed One brought Eliyahu to heaven the Angel of Death stood to oppose Him. "
