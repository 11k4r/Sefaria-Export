        "1_Shabbat, 0_Kabbalat Shabbat, 1_Psalm 95, 1_Paragraph": "Come, let us sing to YHVH, and shout for joy to the Rock of our deliverance. Let us come into YHVH’s presence with thanks; let us shout for joy to YHVH with song. For YHVH is a great god, and a great majesty above all gods. In God’s hands are the depths of the earth, and the peaks of the mountains are God’s. The sea is God’s, for God made it; and God’s hands shaped the dry land. Come, let us bow down and bend the knee; let us kneel before YHVH our maker, For YHVH is our god, and we are the people that God shepherds, the flock of God’s hand. Today, if you would but listen to God’s voice! Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as on the day of Massah, in the wilderness; When your ancestors tested and tried Me, even though they saw My work. For forty years, I was weary with that generation and said: This is a people confused at heart, that do not know My ways. For that reason, I swore in My anger, that they would never enter My resting place. ",
