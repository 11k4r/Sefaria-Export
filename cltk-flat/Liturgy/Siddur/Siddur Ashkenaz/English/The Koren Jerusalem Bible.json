        "0_Weekday, 0_Shacharit, 1_Pesukei Dezimra, 4_Mizmor Letoda, 0_Paragraph": "A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth. Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing. Know that the Lord he is God: it is he who made us, and we belong to him; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful to him, and bless his name. For the Lord is good; his steadfast love endures forever; and his faithfulness to all generations.",
        "0_Weekday, 0_Shacharit, 1_Pesukei Dezimra, 7_Psalm 146, 0_Paragraph": "Haleluya! Praise the Lord, O my soul. While I live I will praise the Lord: I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. Happy is he who has the God of Ya῾aqov for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God: who made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that is in them: who keeps truth forever. Who executes judgment for the oppressed: who gives bread to the hungry. The Lord looses the prisoners: the Lord opens the eyes of the blind: the Lord raises those who are bowed down: the Lord loves the righteous: the Lord preserves the strangers; he relieves the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he makes crooked. The Lord shall reign forever, thy God, O Żiyyon, to all generations. Haleluya!"
