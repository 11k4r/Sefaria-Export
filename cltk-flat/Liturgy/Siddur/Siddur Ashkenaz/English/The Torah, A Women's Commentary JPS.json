        "0_Weekday, 0_Shacharit, 2_Blessings of the Shema, 3_Shema, 3_Paragraph": "...If, then, you obey the commandments that I enjoin upon you this day, loving your God YHVH and service [God]with all your heart and soul, I will grant the rain for your land in season, the early rain and the late. You shall gather in your new grain and wine and oil--I will also provide grass in the fields for your cattle--and thus you shall eat your fill. Take care not to be lured away to serve other gods and bow to them. For YHVH's anger will flare up against you, shutting up the skies so that there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its produce; and you will soon perish from the good land that YHVH is assigning to you.  Therefore impress these My words upon your very heart: bind them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead, and teach them to your children--reciting them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you get up; and inscribe them on your gates--to the end that you and your chilrden may endure. in the land that YHVH swore to you fathers to assign to them, as long as there is a heaven over the earth."
