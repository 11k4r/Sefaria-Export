From Your rebuke they flee; from the voice of your Thunder – they rushed away; Ascending mountains and descending to valleys – to this place that you founded for them. A boundary did You establish without letting them pass; without letting them return to cover the earth. He sends streams in the valleys, between the mountains they flow. They (the rivers) irrigate all of the beasts the field, they satiate the wild animals thirst. Near them do birds of the sky dwell, from among the branches they give their voice [in song]. He irrigates mountains from His upper chambers, with the fruits of Your handiwork You satiate the earth. He sprouts grass for the animals and vegetation for the service, for man to extract bread from the earth. And wine gladdens the heart of man – to make the face shine from oil and with bread are the hearts of man satiated. You satiate the trees – L·rd – the cedars of Lebanon – that were planted. Where are birds – You direct the stork with to her house in the junipers. High mountains are for the chamois - rocks a refuge for the rock badgers. He made the moon for the seasons – the sun to know its coming. You spread Darkness and it is night – when all creatures swarm the forest. The Young lions roar upon their prey – and ask from G·d their food. You shine the sun – and gather them and to their dwelling they go to lie. A man goes to his labor and to his work while it is night. How great are Your works, L·rd, all of them with great wisdom did You make them – the earth is full of Your creatures. This is the great ocean – and width of hands – there swarms – and there uncountable small creatures with the large ones. There the ships go – this You created to  sail in it. All of them you give sustenance – to give them food in their proper time. You give to them their gatherings, You open your hands and hey are sustained well. You conceal Your face – they are bewildered – You remove their breath and they die and they return to their dust. You send Your spirit – you created them and renew the face of the earth. May the Honor of the L·rd be eternal  - let the L·rd rejoice in his creations. He looks to the earth and it trembles, He touches the mountains and they smoke.
