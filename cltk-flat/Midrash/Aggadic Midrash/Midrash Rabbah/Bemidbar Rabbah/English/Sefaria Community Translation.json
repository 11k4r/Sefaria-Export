        "22_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "A Halakha: <u>Is one who is pursued by non-Jews or bandits allowed to transgress the laws of Sabbath?</u> Our Rabbis taught: One who is pursued by non-Jews or bandits is permitted to transgress the laws of Sabbath, in order to save his life. Thus we also find with David: When Saul attempted to kill him, he fled and escaped. Our Rabbis said: It once happened that they came to the [Jewish] leadership in Sepphoris with harsh orders from the [Roman] government. They went and said to R. Elazar b. Parta: O Rabbi! We have received harsh orders from the government. What do you say we should do, should we flee? He feared telling them to flee explicitly, so he hinted to them: \"Why are you asking me? Go and ask Yaakov, Moshe, and David\". What does it say about Yaakov? (Hosea 12): \"And Jacob fled.\" Also about Moshe, (Exodus 2): \"Moshe fled.\" And also about David, (I Samuel 19): \"David fled and escaped.\" It also says (Isaiah 26): \"Go my people, enter your rooms.\" The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Such great ones were fearful and fled from those who hated them, yet for those forty years that you were in the desert, I did not let them flee. Instead I felled all their haters before them, in that I myself that was with them. Not only that, but there were all kinds of snakes, serafim, and scorpions there: (Deuteronomy 8): \"Snakes, sefarim, and scorpions\", yet I did not allow them to hurt you. Therefore The Holy One Blessed Be He said to Moshe: Record the journeys that Israel undertook in the desert, it order that they should know what kind of miracles I performed from them. How [will they know]? From all that they read regarding \"These are the journeys\".", 
        "20_Chapter, 13_Paragraph": "\"And Moshe said to the Lord saying, 'Appoint, Lord, God of the spirits'\" - anyone who seeks the needs of the community is as if he comes by force. \"Appoint, Lord\" - what did he see to seek this thing after the arrangement of the inheritance? Rather, when the daughters of Tzelophad inherited [from] their father, Moshe said, \"Behold, it is the time in which to claim my needs. If daughters inherit, it is appropriate that my sons inherit my glory.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said [back] to him, \"'He who tends a fig tree will enjoy its fruit' (Proverbs 27:18) - your sons sat for themselves and were not occupied with Torah. Yehoshua served you much and gave you much honor; and he would come early and leave late your council chamber; he would arrange the benches and roll out the mats - since he served you with all of his strength, he is worthy to tend to Israel, so as to not lose his wage. 'Take Yehoshua the son of Nun,' in order to fulfill, 'He who tends a fig tree will enjoy its fruit.'\"", 
        "18_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "...R. Acha in the name of R. Chanina said: At the time when Moses ascended to the heavenly heights, he heard the voice of the Holy One, Blessed Be He, who was sitting and studying the [Torah portion of] the Red Heifer, and uttering a halakhah in the name of the one who spoke it. \"R. Eliezer said: a calf [when written in the Torah] is one year old, and a cow is two [years old].\" [Moses] said before Him: \"Master of All the Worlds! May it be Your will that he [R. Eliezer] would be from my loins [i.e. would be my descendant].\" [God] said to him: \"By your life [i.e. assuredly] he is from your loins! For so it says in Scripture (Exodus 18:4): \"...and the name of the other [son of Moses] was 'Eliezer'...\", the same particular name.", 
        "18_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "This is the ordinance of the Torah - (Psalms 12:6) The sayings of G-d are pure (purify). R. Hanan Ben Pazzi elucidated this verse [of psalms with the parsha of Parah] Parah- which has seven seven sevens; seven cows, seven fires, seven sprinkling, seven washes, seven unclean, seven pure, seven priests. And if someone tells you they are five, tell him: Moses and Aaron are included, as it is said: And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, This is the ordinance of the Torah:", 
        "20_Chapter, 9_Paragraph": "<b>And the daughters of Tzelophad approached:</b> In that generation, the women would seal what the men would puncture. As so do you find that Aharon said to them (Exodus 32:2), \"Remove the earrings of gold that are in the ears of your wives\" - and the women did not want and they protested against their husbands, as it is stated (Exodus 32:3), \"And the entire people removed the earrings of gold, etc.\" And the women did not participate with them in the [building of the] golden calf. And so [too] with the scouts that put out calumny: \"And they came back and they brought the entire congregation to complain\" (Numbers 14:36), and upon them was the decree decreed, as they [were the ones that] said, \"we cannot go up\" (Numbers 13:31). But the women were not with them in the counsel, as it it written beyond this section (Numbers 26:65), \"As God said to them, 'You shall surely die in the desert,' and not a man remained from them except for Calev the son of Yefuneh\" - [it is written] \"a man,\" but not a woman; because of [the men] not wanting to enter the land, but the women approached to request an inheritance in the land. Therefore, this section is written adjacent to the death of the generation of the wilderness (that came out of Egypt) - as from there did the men puncture and the women seal.", 
        "11_Chapter, 15_Paragraph": "\"And the Chieftains of Israel offered\" (Bamidbar 7:2) Why were the Chieftains anxious to make the first offerings, but in the case of the Mishkan they were lazy and only brought lapis lazuli and other stones last?  When Moses said, \"Anyone whose heart so moves them, bring gifts to the Lord for the work of the Tabernacle,\" he did not (specifically) ask the Chieftains and this was wrong in their eyes.  They said, \"Let the people bring what is necessary, and whatever is left we will complete.\"  All of Israel was joyous in the work of the Tabernacle, and they brought with joy everything voluntarily and with speed.  See what is written, (Exodus 35:22) \"They brought, the men and the woman.\"  They were pushing one another and the men and woman were coming all mixed together. For two mornings they brought all the offerings, as it is written (Exodus 36:3) \"They continued to bring to him freewill offerings morning after morning.\" And it is written, (Exodus 36:7) \"The work was enough for them\" After two days the Chieftains requested to bring their freewill offerings, but they couldn't since Moses had already commanded, (Exodus 36:6) \"A proclamation was made through the camp, 'Let no further effort be made'\" The Chieftains were troubled that they did not merit in the freewill offerings of the Tabernacle.   They said, \"Since we have not merited in the work of the Tabernacle, we will give for the clothes of the High Priests.\"  Thus it is written (Exodus 35:27) \"The Priests brought lapis lazuli and other stones\"  The Holy Blessed One said, \"Of my children who were quick to bring, let it be written that they brought more than enough.  But the Chieftens who were lazy, a letter should be removed from their name.  Thus it is written \"והנשאם\" which is missing the letter \"י\".  Thus when the work of the Tabernacle was completed, they were quick to bring the sacrifices quickly.", 
        "18_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "...And they will take for you a red cow - Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Hanina says, The Holy One blessed be he said to Moses: \"to you I will reveal the reason for the red cow, but for others it will be a decree (without reason)\", as Rav Huna says, \"it is written (Psalms 75:3) \"At the time I choose, I will give judgment righteously/equitably\", and it is written (Zechariah 14:6), \"And it will come to pass on that day there will not be light, yeqarot and qippa'on. The written [tradition of orthography in scrolls] version is \"yiqpa'un\" {future tense = they will float}, [meaning] things which are hidden/covered from you in this world, in the future will float up [to the surface] in the world to come.\"", 
        "18_Chapter, 7_Paragraph": "A gentile asked Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, \"These rituals you do, they seem like witchcraft! You bring a heifer, burn it, crush it up, and take its ashes. [If] one of you is impure by the dead [the highest type impurity], 2 or 3 drops are sprinkled on him, and you declare him pure?!\" He said to him, \"Has a restless spirit ever entered you?\" He said to him, \"No!\" \"Have you ever seen a man where a restless spirit entered him?\" He said to him, \"Yes!\" [Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai] said to him, \"And what did you do for him?\" He sad to him, \"We brought roots and made them smoke beneath him, and pour water and it flees.\" He said to him, \"Your ears should hear what leaves from your mouth! The same thing is true for this spirit, the spirit of impurity, as it is written, (Zachariah 13:2) \"Even the prophets and the spirit of impurity will I remove from the land.\" They sprinkle upon him purifying waters, and it [the spirit of impurity] flees.\" After he left, our rabbi's students said, \"You pushed him off with a reed. What will you say to us?\" He said to them, \"By your lives, a dead person doesn't make things impure, and the water doesn't make things pure. Rather, God said, 'I have engraved a rule, I have decreed a decree (chukah chakakti, gezeira gazarti), and you have no permission to transgress what I decreed, as it says \"This is a chok (rule) of the Torah.\"", 
        "7_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "Man or woman, who does any of the sins etc. - Rabi Abahu says (Hosea 14:8): 'Those that dwell under His shadow' those are the gerim that come and have love for the shadow of the Holy One of Blessing. 'They shall grow as grain' in [the study of] Talmud. 'Shall blossom as vine' in [the study of] Aggadah. 'His memory/scent shall be as the wine of Lebanon' - said the Holy One of Blessing: \"The appreciation of the gerim is as dear to me as the wine that was poured on the altar [as libation.]\" And why does He call it [the altar] Lebanon (root LVN)? Because it whitens (maLViN) the sins of Israel like snow, as it is written (Isaiah 1:18) 'though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.' Rabi Shimon Bar Yochai says: because all the hearts (LeVavot) become happy due to it. As it says (Psalms 48:2): 'Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth.' And the rabbis say - because of the verse (II Kings 9:3) 'and My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.' Another interpretation: 'they will grow as grain' - they will make the essence, they are like Israel; as it is said (Zechariah 9:17) 'grain [for] the young men [of Israel]'. 'They shall blossom as vine', as [just like] Israel, as it says (Psalms 80:9) 'You plucked a vine from Egypt.' And so you find that, just as a portion of the Torah was written regarding one Israel and another - that if he misappropriated something of him, that he is obligated to a sacrifice, as it is written (Leviticus 5:21) 'If any one sin, and commit a trespass etc.' - so too you find that the Holy One of Blessing wrote a portion of the Torah regarding what goes on between Israel and gerim, that if a man from Israel steals from a ger, the judgement is as if he stole from another man from Israel. You find that regarding this it is written 'a sin that he sinned' and regarding stealing from a ger it is written 'from any sins of a man.' Regarding this one it is written 'and trespassed a trespass against the Lord' and regarding this one it is written 'to trespass a trespass against the Lord.' Regarding this one it is written: 'And it will be, when he sins and is guilty' and regarding the ger it is written 'and that soul will be guilty'. Regarding this one it is written: 'And he will pay with his head' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will return his guilt with his head'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will add his fifth' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will add a fifth'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will bring his guilt-offering to the Lord' and regarding stealing a ger it is written 'besides the ram for the kipurim'. Behold we have learned: that the essence of the gerim is like Israel's. Therefore, they will be as grain and blossom.", 
        "20_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "\"Assail the Midianites\" - Why? \"For they assailed you\" (Numbers 25:18). From here the sages said, 'rise and kill the one who comes to kill you.' Rabbi Shimon says, \"Form where [do we know that it is true] even more of one who causes a man to sin than one who kills him - as the one who kills, kills in this world but [the victim] has a share in the world to come; [whereas] the one who causes him to sin, kills him in this world and in the world to come. Two nations greeted Israel with the sword and two with sin: The Egyptians and the Edomites greeted with the sword - 'The enemy said, \"I will pursue, I will reach, I will empty my sword\"' (Exodus 15:9); 'And Edom said to him, \"You shall not pass through me, else I will go out against you with the sword.\"' And two [nations greeted] with sin, the Moabites and the Ammonites. About the ones that came out with the sword, it is written (Deuteronomy 23:8), 'You shall not abhor an Edomite... you shall not abhor an Egyptian.' But [about those] that greeted with sin to cause Israel to sin, [it is written] (Deuteronomy 23:4), 'No Ammonite or Moabite shall be admitted... even in the tenth generation... forever.'\"", 
        "12_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "One silver basin represents the Torah which has been likened to wine, as it is stated, \"And drink of the wine which I have mingled\" (Mishlei 9:5). Now because it is customary to drink wine in a basin – as you may gather from the text, \"They who drink wine in basins\" (Amos 6:6) – therefore, he brought a basin. Why \"of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary\"? As the numerical value of yayin (wine) is seventy, so there are shivim panim la’Torah (seventy facets/sides of Torah).", 
        "12_Chapter, 15_Paragraph": "<b>On the second day, brought (<i>hikriv</i>) Netanel, etc.:</b> Why does it state, \"brought\" [only with Netanel]? Because Reuven came and appealed: He said, “It is enough that Yehudah should precede me with the encampments; I should bring [next] based on the order of birth! Moshe rebuked him and said to him, “It is from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, that it was told to me – bring (<i>hakrev</i>, which is the <i>ketiv</i> – the way the word is spelled in the Torah) from the [order of the] encampments!” Another explanation: <i>Hikriv</i> (which also means ‘he put him forward’) – Moshe put him forward against the will of Reuven. Another explanation: As if he brought first (even before Yehudah). Why is this so? Since he merited to have the counsel of the princes [to offer wagons], the verse counts it as if he were the first one to bring [it] up. Abba Chanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, “Since he merited to have the counsel, he merited to have understanding given to his tribe, as it is stated (I Chronicles 12:33), ‘And from the children of Yissachar, who know understanding of times.’” And it is stated (Judges 5:15), “And Yissachar’s chiefs were with Deborah, etc.” And so does the verse recount his praise in the courts in Egypt, as it is stated (Numbers 26:24), “To Yashuv was the Yashuvite family” – and Yashuv is always [referring to] courts, as it is stated (Ezekiel 33:31), “They will come to you in crowds and sit (<i>yeshvu</i>) before you, etc.”; “and Yaakov was a simple man who sits (<i>yoshev</i>)  in tents” (Genesis 25:27), and it states (Deuteronomy 33:18), “and Yissachar in his tents.” <b>Brought his sacrifice, etc.</b> –  Rabbi Pinchas be Yair said, “Why did it add [the word,] <i>hikriv</i> and remove [the letter,] <i>yod</i>? Rather it is corresponding to the red heifer that they made that day. Therefore, it added [the word,] <i>hikriv</i> missing <i>yod</i>, and left the word with four letters – corresponding to the four things that the heifer required: red, complete, without a blemish, without the carrying of a yoke. As you would say (Numbers 19:2), ‘and they shall take to you a red heifer that is complete, etc.’” <b>One silver bowl</b> – the prince of Yissachar came and brought the offering for the sake of the Torah; as they love the Torah more than the other tribes, as it is stated (I Chronicles 12:33), “And from the children of Yissachar, who know understanding of times, etc.” What is “of times?” Rabbi Tanchuma said, “ Of holidays.” Rabbi Yose said, “Of intercalations.” [This verse in Chronicles continues,] “to know what Israel shall do” – on which day they shall make the holidays. [And further in the verse,] “their heads are two hundred” – these are the two hundred leaders of the Sanhedrin groomed by the tribe of Yissachar. [Still in the verse,] “and all of their brothers according to their mouths” – that they would agree to the law based on their mouths. And it states (Genesis 49:15), “bent his shoulder to haul” – since they would haul the yoke of Torah. [The verse in Genesis continues] \"and he will be a conscripted worker\" - as anyone who was mistaken in the law would ask it to the tribe of Yissachar and they would clarify it for them. <b>A silver bowl</b> – corresponding to the Torah that is called ‘bread,’ as it stated (Proverbs 19:5), “Come repast on my bread.”  And it is said about the showbread  (Exodus 25:29), “And you shall make its bowls and its ladles”; and we learned, “its bowls”  - these are the molds, as they would make the showbread in molds. <b>One hundred and thirty was its weight</b> – go out and calculate: twenty-four books of the written Torah and eighty from the Mishnah; which begins with [the letter,]  <i>mem</i> (which has a numerical equivalent of forty), “<i>me’imatai korin et haShema</i>, etc. and ends with <i>mem, “Hashem yivarech et amo be’shalom”</i>.  <i>Mem</i>  is forty and [another] <i>mem</i> is forty; behold eighty, [so] one hundred and four, as this is the count that the written Torah and the oral Torah come to. Another explanation: The beginnings of the six Orders of the Mishnah – the first letters come to eighty. Go out and calculate: <i>Mem</i> (forty) from “<i>me’imatai</i>” from the Order of Seeds; <i>yod</i> (ten) from “<i>yitziot haShabbat</i>” from the Order of Appointed Time; <i>chet</i> (eight) from “<i>chamesh-esreh nashim</i>” from the Order of Women; one (<i>alef</i>) from “<i>arbaah avot nezikin</i>” from the Order of Salvations (Damages); <i>caf</i> (twenty) from “<i>kol haZevachim</i>” from the Order of Holy Things; one (<i>alef</i>) from “<i>avot haTumaot </i>” from the Order of Purities - behold eighty, [so] from here [you see that] the count of the written Torah and the oral Torah come to one hundred and four. And it was given in twenty-six generations which were from Adam to Moshe, through whom the Torah was given – behold, one hundred and thirty. Hence the weight of the bowl was one hundred and thirty. <b>One basin of silver</b> – corresponding to the Torah which is compared to wine, as it is stated (Proverbs 9:5), “and drink from the wine that I have mixed.” And since it is the custom of wine to be drunk form a basin, as you say (Amos 6:6), “Who drink from wine basins” – therefore, he brought “a basin that is seventy shekel of the holy shekels.” Why? Just like the numerical equivalent of wine is seventy, so too are there seventy faces to the Torah. Why does it state “one” about the bowl? Corresponding to the Torah that must be one, as you say (Numbers 15:16), “One Torah and one statute shall there be for you.” Why does it state “one” about the basin? Because the words of the written Torah and the words of the Oral Torah were all given by one shepherd – all of them were stated by one God to Moshe at Sinai. Why were they of silver? Corresponding to the Torah, about which it is stated (Psalms 12:7), “The words of the Lord are pure words, silver purged in a crucible, etc.” <b>Both of them filled with fine flour, etc.</b> – Scripture and Mishnah are full, since one does not contradict its fellow. <b>Fine flour</b> – as you say (Psalms 19:11), “drippings (<i>nofet</i>) of the comb” – like flour that one can see on top of the sieve (<i>napah</i>). <b>Mixed with oil</b> – that is Torah, which is required to be mixed with good deeds; like that which we learned (Avot 2:2),” Excellent is the study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation; for the exertion [expended] in both of them causes sin to be forgotten.” That is <b>for the offering</b> – as at that time, he brings a pleasantness of spirit to his Creator, when a man is involved in Torah study and is a master of good deeds and guards himself from sin. <b>One ladle</b> – corresponding to the tablets that were written by the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, as you say (Exodus 32:16), “The tablets were God’s work, and the writing was God’s writing, etc.” <b>Ten of gold</b> – these are the ten statements (commandments) that were written on the tablets, as you say (Deuteronomy 10:4), “And He wrote on the tablets like the first writing, etc.” <b>Gold</b> – like you say (Song of Songs 5:14), “His hands are rods of gold”; and it states (Psalms 19:11), “More precious than gold, etc.” <b>Full of incense</b> – since the six hundred and thirteen commandments are mixed in them. And so do you find that there are six hundred and thirteen letters from “I” (the first word in the ten commandments) to “of your friend” (the last word), corresponding to the six hundred and thirteen commandments; and there are seven letters lacking, corresponding to the seven days of creation – to teach you that the whole world was only created in the merit of the Torah. That is <b>full of incense (<i>ketoret</i>)</b> – since the [letter] <i>kof</i> changes to a <i>dalet</i> [in] <i>at-bash gar-dak</i> (switching the early letters in the aleph-bet with the corresponding later letters), and the [numerical] count of the word then comes to six hundred and thirteen. Another explanation: <b>full of incense</b> – as between each and every statement written on the tablets, the sections and the details were written. And it comes out like that which Chananiah the son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua said: “His hands are rods of gold” – these are the two tablets of the covenant upon which were written, ‘written by the finger of God.' “Rods of gold” – just like these rods, between one large rod and another large rod, there are small rods; so too, between each and every statement, the sections of the Torah were written and its details. <b>One bull of the herd</b> – corresponding to the priests; <b>one ram</b> – corresponding to the Levites; <b>one lamb</b> – corresponding to Israel, as they all accepted the Torah as Sinai. <b>One goat for a sin offering</b> – corresponding to the converts that would convert in the future and were there; as everyone is fitting, as it is stated (Leviticus 18: 5), “which a man shall do and live by them.” It does not state, “priests, Levites and Israelites,” but rather “a man.” [This] teaches that, behold, even an idolater that converts and is involved in Torah is like a high priest. <b>And for peace offerings, two oxen (<i>bakar</i>)</b> – corresponding to the two Torahs; as anyone who checks (<i>mevaker</i>) and sacrifices his inclination to do everything that is written in them is making peace twice – peace above and peace below; as it is stated (Isaiah 27:5), “But if he holds fast to My refuge, peace will he make with Me, with Me he will make peace.” <b>Five rams, five he-goats, and five yearling lambs</b> - corresponding to three verses of the Torah in which the six Orders of the Mishnah are [indicated]. And they are [each] of two sections, and each and every section is made of five words, and these are them (Psalms 19:8-10): “The Torah of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul; the decrees of the Lord, etc.... The ordinances of the Lord, etc.; the commandments of the Lord, etc.... The fear of the Lord, etc.; the judgments of the Lord, etc.” Hence they offered these three types of sacrifices as peace offerings, corresponding to the three verses in which the six Orders of the Mishnah are [indicated]. It comes out like that which Rabbi Tanchuma said: “The Torah of the Lord is perfect, [restoring the soul], etc.” – this is the Order of Women that warns a man to separate from sexual prohibitions in order to save him from death, like the one that says (Proverbs 5:19), “All who go to her cannot return and find again the paths of life.” And it states (Proverbs 5:16), “It will save you from the forbidden woman, etc.” “The decrees of the Lord [are trustworthy], etc.” – this is the Order of Seeds, as one has trust in the world’s Life and sows. “The ordinances of the Lord, [are just, rejoicing the heart], etc.” – this is the Order of Appointed Time that has all of the holidays in it, about which it is written (Deuteronomy 16:14), “And you shall rejoice in your holidays.” “The commandments of the Lord [are lucid, making the eyes light up,]. etc.” – this is the Order of Holy Things, which enlightens the eyes [to differentiate] between profane things and holy things. “The fear of the Lord [is pure], etc.” – this is the Order of Purities, which separates between purity and impurity. “The judgments of the Lord, etc.” – this is the Order of Damages, in which there are most of the laws.  And hence they offered five of each type corresponding to the five words written for each and every Order. And why were five words written for each and every order? Corresponding to the Torah which is five books, [in order] to teach you that [the sections of the Mishnah] are bodies of Torah. Why is the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, written in [the section of the verse relating to] each and every Order? Since He testifies upon them, that He stated them to Moshe from His mouth, in the same way that He stated the five books of the Torah. <b>That was the offering of Netanel, etc.</b> - once the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that he brought offerings according to the Orders of the Torah, He began to praise his sacrifice – “that was the offering of Netanel son of Tzuar.”", 
        "12_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "E-lohim is known in Yehudah [in Israel His Name is great] (Ps. 76:2), Rabbi Yehudah bar Ilai said:  When Israel was at the sea, the tribes were arguing with each other. One tribe said:  'I will go down first [into the sea]', and the other tribe said 'I will go down first.'  Nachshon jumped first into the waves of the sea and went down, and on him David said, \"Deliver me, O God, for the waters have reached my neck.\" Said the Holy One of Blessing to Moshe: My beloved is sinking in the sea and you are praying?! 'Tell the Israelites to get going!'(Ex. 14:15)\"This is 'E-lohim is known in Yehudah', and therefore the Holy One of Blessing increased the name of Nachshon among Israel, that he merited to be the first to bring offerings [for the Mishkan] , as it says: 'And the bringer on the first day, etc' - this is 'and in Israel his name became great.'", 
        "12_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "… they said to him: we said ours, now you say yours! He said to them: everywhere that it uses the phrase ‘and it will be’ indicates joy. \"And it will be on that day that the mountains shall drip with wine...\" (Yoel 4:18) “And it will be on that day that living water shall come forth from Jerusalem...\" (Zechariah 14:8) \"And it will be that on that day, the Lord shall continue…” (Isaiah 11:11) “And it shall come to pass on that day, a man shall keep alive a heifer of the herd…” (Isaiah 7:21) \"And it will be on that day, that a great shofar shall be sounded...\" (Isaiah 27:13) “And it will be that every survivor shall be in Zion…” (Isaiah 4:3) But it is also written “…and he was when Jerusalem was taken.” (Jeremiah 38:28) He replied to them: this also is joy and not sorrow, because on that very day the comforter was born and on that very day Israel took full recompense for all of their sins. As R’ Shmuel bar Nachman said: Israel took their full recompense for their sins on the day that the Holy Temple was destroyed, as it says “Your iniquity is complete, O daughter of Zion; He will no longer send you into exile…” (Lamentations 4:22)", 
        "14_Chapter, 9_Paragraph": "Rabbi Levi son of Rabbi says: A pure Menorah came down from heaven, as The Holy One Who is Blessed said to Moshe \"You will make a Menorah of pure gold [alt: a pure Menorah of gold]\" (Shmot 25:31) [Moshe] responded: how will we make it? [God] responded \"It will be made of hammered work [mikshah]\" (Shmot 25:31). Nevertheless, Moshe struggled [nitkasha] and went down and forgot its manner of work. He went up and said: My Master, how will we make it? [God] said \"It will be made of hammered work.\" Nevertheless, Moshe struggled and went down and forgot. He went up and said: My Master, I forgot it. [God] showed Moshe and Moshe still struggled. [God] said to him: \"See and do\" (Shmot 25:40), and took a Menorah of fire and showed him how it was made. Nevertheless, it was a struggle for Moshe. The Holy One Who is Blessed said to him: Go to Betzalel, and he will make it. [Moshe] told Betzalel and he immediately made it. He was amazed and said: For me, how many times did the Holy One Who is Blessed show me and I struggled to make it, but for you, who never saw it, you make it from your thoughts! Betzalel, you were standing in the shadow of God [b'tzel el] when the Holy One Who is Blessed showed me how to make it. Therefore, when the Temple was destroyed, the Menorah was hidden. And this is one of the five things that was hidden: the ark, the Menorah, the fire, the holy spirit, and the cherubs. When the Holy One Who is Blessed returns in [God]'s mercy and builds [God]'s house and sanctuary, [God] will bring them back to their place to make Jerusalem rejoice, as it says, \"The arid desert shall be glad, The wilderness shall rejoice\" (Isaiah 35:1), \"It shall blossom abundantly, It shall also exult\" (Isaiah 35:2).", 
        "2_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "A righteous person will flourish like a date palm. No part of the date palm is wasted: Its dates are eaten; its young branches are used for ritual blessing [of the lulav on sukkot]; its fronds cover the Sukkah; its fibers are used to make ropes; its leaves are used for sieves; its planed trunks are used for roof beams. So too there are none worthless in Israel: Some are versed in the Bible; others know Mishnah; some are masters of aggadah [storytelling]; others do good deeds; still others promote social equity.", 
        "2_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "Another [explanation]: \"Bring close the tribe of Levi, etc.\" - this is [the meaning of] what is written (Psalms 65:5), \"Happy is the one whom You have chosen and You have brought close\": Happy is the one whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has chosen, even though he has not brought him close. And happy is the man that He has brought close, even though He has not chosen  him. And who is the one whom He has chosen? That is Avraham, as it is stated (Nehemiah 9:7), \"You are He, Lord God, Who chose Avram.\" But He did not bring him close, but rather he brought himself close. The Holy One, blessed be He, chose Yaakov, as it is stated (Psalms 135:4), \"For Yaakov did the Lord choose.\" And so [too] it says (Isaiah 41:8), \"Yaakov whom You have chosen.\" But He did not bring him close, but rather he brought himself close, as it is stated (Genesis 25:27), \"Yaakov was a simple man that sat in tents.\" He chose Moshe, as it is stated (Psalms 106:23), \"were it not for Moshe, His chosen\"; but He did not bring him close. Happy are those that the Holy One, blessed be He, chose, even though He did not bring them close. Come and see - the Holy One, blessed be He, brought Yitro close, but He did not choose him. He brought Rachav the prostitute close but He did not choose her. Happy are these that whom He brought close, even though He did not choose them. A [Roman] matron asked Rabbi Yose, \"[Does] your God bring close whomever He wants (arbitrarily)?\" [So] he brought a basket of figs in front of her and she would choose a nice one, she would choose it and eat it. He said to her, \"You know how to choose, [does] the Holy One, blessed be He not know how to choose? The one whom He sees has good deeds, He chooses him and brings him close.\" Rabbi Nechemiah [said] in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitschak, \"Not all who are close are close, and not all who are distant are distant. There is one who is chosen and pushed off and brought close, [and] there is one who is chosen and pushed off and not brought close. Aharon was chosen - (I Samuel 2:28) 'And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for Me as a priest.' And he was pushed off - (Deuteronomy 9:20) 'And with Aharon did the Lord get angry.' And it is written [after the event that the last verse cited was referring to] (Exodus 28:1), 'And you should bring close to you Aharon your brother.' Shaul was chosen - (I Samuel 10:24) 'Have you seen the one that the Lord chose?' And he was pushed off - (ibid., 15:11) 'I have regretted that I have crowned Shaul, etc.' And he was not brought close [again] - (ibid., 16:1) 'And I have been disgusted with him from ruling over Israel.' David was chosen - (Psalms 78:70) 'And He chose David, His servant.' And he was pushed off - (II Samuel 15:16-17) 'And the king went out, and all of household on his heels,... and they stood in Beit Merchak.'\" Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, \"They excommunicated him. Nonetheless, he accepted his excommunication. This is [the meaning] of that which is written, (II Samuel 15:30) 'and David went up to the Ascent of Olives, he went up and cried, and his head was covered.'\" \"And he was brought close [again].\" Rabbi Yudan said, \"Eira Hayairi, the teacher of David, brought him close. This is what David says (Psalms 119:79), 'Let those that fear You (<i>yeirecha</i>) return to me, and they that know Your testimonies' - ['they that know'] is written as 'he that knows,' [meaning that]  Eira Hayairi was his teacher and brought [David] close.\" Rabbi Yehoshua of Sakhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, \"There are six that were chosen: the priesthood; the order of Levi; Israel; the monarchy of the house of David; Jerusalem; [and] the Temple. From where [do we know this about] the priesthood? Since it is written (I Samuel 2:28), 'And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for Me as a priest.'  From where [do we know this about] the order of Levi? As it is stated (Deuteronomy 18:5), 'As he was chosen by the Lord, your God.' From where [do we know this about]Israel? As it is stated (Ibid., 7:6), 'the Lord, your God, chose you.' From where [do we know this about] the monarchy of the house of David? As it is stated (Psalms 78:70), 'And He chose David, His servant.' From where [do we know this about] Jerusalem? As it is stated (I Kings 11:32), 'the city that you chose.' From where [do we know this about] the Temple? As it stated (II Chronicles 7:16), 'I have chosen and sanctified this house.'\" David [meant to say in Psalms 65:5], \"Happy is the one whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has chosen, and happy is the one that He has brought close. And who is the one who is doubly happy? The one that the Holy One, blessed be He, chose and brought close.\" And who is that? That is Aharon and [the tribe of] Levi. From where [do we know this about] Aharon? Since it is written (I Samuel 2:28), \"And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for Me as a priest.\" And from where [do we know] that He brought him close? As it is stated (Exodus 28:1), \"And you should bring close to you Aharon your brother.\" The Holy One, blessed be He chose Levi, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 18:5), \"As he was chosen by the Lord, your God.\" And from where [do we know] that He brought him close? As it is stated [here], \"Bring close the tribe of Levi, and stand [it up].\" And about them the verse (Psalms 65:5) says, \"Happy is the one whom You have chosen and You have brought close, who dwells in your courtyards\"; as you say (Numbers 3:7), \"And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation, etc.\"   [The continuation of Psalms 65:5 is:] \"let us be satiated from the good of Your house\" - that thy would eat from the tithes that were brought to the [Temple], as you would say (Numbers 18:21), \"To the house of Levi, behold, I have given all tithe in Israel for an inheritance, etc.\"  ", 
        "16_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "(1) \"When you come to the land of your dwellings\": What is the halacha of how many things a person is obligated to do for his son? Our rabbis taught: A person is obligated to do five things for his son. G-d can be compared to a father and the Jewish people to His son. Just like a father is obligated to circumcise his son, G-d did so for the Jews by circumcising them by the hand of Yehoshua as it says (Joshua 5:2) \"Make for yourself stone knives.\" A father is obligated to redeem his son [if he is a firstborn] and G-d redeemed the Jews, as it says [II Samuel 7:23) \"to redeem it as a nation.\" [A father is obligated] to teach [his son] Torah, [and] G-d taught the Jews Torah as it says (Deuteronomy 11:19) \"Teach them to your children\" and it is written \"I am G-d your teacher.\" [A father is obligated] to teach [his son] mitsvot, [and] G-d taught the mitsvot to the Jews. [A father is obligated] to marry [his son] to a woman, [and] G-d told mankind: \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" A father is obligated to his son [in the following ways]: to give him food and drink, to bathe him, to give him ointments, and to clothe him, and thus did G-d for the Jews, as it is written (Ezekiel 16: 9) \"And I washed you in water, and I washed away your blood...and I clothed you with embroidered clothing...and My bread which I gave you...\" [and in Numbers 21:17] \"Arise, o well, sing to it.\" What does a father give to a son? Possessions. Thus G-d did for the Jews, as it says in Jeremiah 3:18, \"And I gave you a beloved land.\" And what must a son give to his father? A gift. Thus G-d said to the Jews, \"When you come to the land...and bring an olah-offering to G-d.\"", 
        "18_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "This is the ordinance - As it is said verse (Job:14): Who gave (brought forth) purity to one who is impure? , such as Abraham from Terah, Hezekiah from Achaz, etc , Israel from the nations of the world, the world to come from  this world. Who did so, who commanded so, who decreed it so, if not The One! (the world's only!) ....! There we learned (Parah 4:4): those who occupy themselves with the Parah from beginning to end, impurify their clothes, but it makes clothes Pure. God said: I carved a law (into the fabric of creation), a decree i made, you have no ability to  transgress (override) My law!", 
        "14_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Another reading: \"When you raise up\". You see that Moshe struggled [nitkasha] with the design of the Menorah more than all the other vessels of the Mishkan [Tabernacle], until the Holy One Who is Blessed showed him with a finger. Similarly with the hoofs of impure and pure animals, as it says, \"These are the animals which you shall eat\" (Vayikra 11:4), these are the ones which you shall not eat, and showed him with a finger. Similarly with the moon, \"this month is for you\" (Shmot 12:2). Similarly with the Menorah, \"This is how the Menorah was made: it was hammered work [miksha] of gold\" (Bemidbar 8:4), which is to say how hard [kasha] it is to make, since Moshe became weary on account of it. When he struggled, The Holy One Who is Blessed said to Moshe: take a talent of gold and throw it in the fire and take it out, and it will be formed on its own, as it says, \"its cups, calyxes, and petals were of one piece with it [lit: came out from it]\" (Shmot 37:17) - he would strike it with a hammer and it would be made on its own. Therefore it says \"it will be made [te'aseh] of hammered work\" (Shmot 25:31) written with a [Hebrew letter] \"yod\" and not written \"you will make [ta'aseh]\", that is to say it will be made on its own. Moshe took the talent [of gold] and threw it in the fire. Moshe said, \"Master of the Universe, behold the talent is in the fire. Whatever you wish - so shall it be done.\" The Menorah immediately came out made according to its design, thus it is written, \"According to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses...\" (Bemidbar 8:4). It is not written here \"so did Moses make the Menorah,\" rather \"so was the Menorah made.\" And who made it? The Holy One Who is Blessed. Therefore the Holy One Who is Blessed said to Moshe: If you are careful to light [it] before me, I will protect your souls from every evil thing, since souls are compared to a candle, as it says. \"the candle of Adonai is the soul of a person\" (Proverbs 20:27) and it says, \"When you raise up the candles)\" (Bemidbar 8:2)", 
        "0_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "Hashem said to Moshe in the Sinai Desert. It says in (Psalms 30:7). Rabbi Meir says ", 
        "19_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "\"And Balak son of Zippor saw\": The Torah says (Deuteronomy 32) \"The Rock--perfect is His work for all of His ways are justice.\" Hashem did not give the non-Jews an opening to say in the future \"You have distanced us.\" What did Hashem do? Just like He set up kings and sages and prophets for the Jews, He set these up for the non-Jews. He set up Shlomo as a king over the Jews and the entire earth, and He did the same for Nebuchadnezzar. This one built the Beit Hamikdash and said \"How many praises and supplications there are!\" and this one destroyed it and scoffed and said (Isaiah 14): \"I will ascend to the heights of the clouds.\" He gave David riches, and he took his house for His Name. And he gave Haman riches, and he took an entire nation to be slaughtered. All the greatness that the Jews took, you find that the nations took. Another example: He set up Moshe for the Jews and Bilaam for the nations. Understand what the difference is between Jewish prophets and non-Jewish prophets? Jewish prophets exhort the people about their sins, as it says (Ezekiel 3): \"And you, son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman etc.\" And the prophet from among the nations caused a breach to drive the creations from the world. Not only this, but all the prophets were [given prophecy] from the attribute of mercy on the Jews and the non-Jews, as Yirmiyah said (Jeremiah 48): \"My heart to Moav is as pipes moan.\" And as Yechezkel said (Ezekiel 27): \"Son of man, lament for Tyre.\" And this cruel one stood to uproot an entire nation for no reason. Therefore the passage of Bilaam was written, to make it known why Hashem took away the holy spirit from non-Jews, for this one was from them and see what he did.", 
        "18_Chapter, 8_Paragraph": "\"Take the rod ... give the congregation and their cattle drink\" -- From here [we learn] that the Holy One takes pity on Israel's money. \"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock\" -- similarly it says \"And all of the congregation he gathers to the door of the tent of meeting.\" This teaches that each one saw himself standing on the face of the rock. Likewise, when they crossed the Jordan, all of the Children of Israel entered between the staves of the ark, as it says (Joshua 3): \"Joshua said to the Children of Israel, come near and listen to the words of Hashem.\" [Similarly] here all of Israel were standing and seeing all of the miracles of the rock. They began to say \"Moses knows the rule of the rock. If he asks, it will bring forth water.\" So Moses was uncertain -- \"If I listen to them I nullify the words of the Allpresent, and the Holy One (Job 5:13) 'takes the wise in theןr craftiness.'\" But Moses had been careful for 40 years not to get angry at them, because he was terrified of the oath the Holy One swore: \"Not one of these men will see [the land]...\" They said to him: \"Here is a rock; just as you want to bring forth water from another rock, bring it forth from this one.\" He shouted at them \"Hear now, you rebels!\" \"Rebels (morim)\" has many meanings: 1) \"stubborn ones\" 2) \"fools\" -- in the sea villages they call fools \"morim\". 3) \"those who teach their teachers\" 4) \"archers\" (In I Sam 30:3 the word \"morim\" is used to mean \"archers\".)  ... Even so, Moses only used the rock that the Holy One told him [to use].",

There are people whose names are nice and whose actions are ugly, people whose names are ugly and actions are nice, people whose names and actions are nice, and people whose names and actions are ugly. Whose names are nice and whose actions are ugly - this is Ishmael and Esau: Ishmael means \"listens to God\" (\"<i>Shomea El</i>\"). Esau means \"does the will of his Maker\" (\"<i>Oseh Retzon Osav</i>\"). But their actions are bad. Whose names are ugly and whose actions are nice - these are those who ascended from exile: the children of Barak, the children of Sisera, and the children of Tamach. Whose names and actions are ugly - these are the spies. What is written about them? Sethur - that he closed him off (\"<i>setharo</i>\") from the world.", 
        "3_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "Another interpretation: \"Number all the first-born males...\" (Numbers 3:40) This is what is written (Song of Songs 6:8-9): \"There are threescore queens ... My dove, my undefiled, is but one ...\" Compare in parable to a person who had a sales-bundle of glass stones and would bring them them to the market, but would not notice their number, since he would not bring them out by number. He would go in to put them away and would not put them away by number, since he would not care about them, as they were glass. But he had one sales-bundle of precious pearls, and he would take it and bring it out by number and put it away by number. Similarly, so to speak, the Holy One Blessed be He said to the nations of the world, \"I have not assigned a number. Why? Because they are not important to me at all. As it says (Isaiah 40:17), 'All the nations are as nothing before Him.' But you are My children, as it says, (Isaiah 46:3), 'that are borne [by Me] from the birth ...' Therefore, I count you all the time.\" Therefore, it is said \"Number all the first-born males.\" That is: \"There are threescore queens ... My dove, my undefiled, is but one ...\" - these are Israel."
