        "18_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "...R. Acha in the name of R. Chanina said: At the time when Moses ascended to the heavenly heights, he heard the voice of the Holy One, Blessed Be He, who was sitting and studying the [Torah portion of] the Red Heifer, and uttering a halakhah in the name of the one who spoke it. \"R. Eliezer said: a calf [when written in the Torah] is one year old, and a cow is two [years old].\" [Moses] said before Him: \"Master of All the Worlds! May it be Your will that he [R. Eliezer] would be from my loins [i.e. would be my descendant].\" [God] said to him: \"By your life [i.e. assuredly] he is from your loins! For so it says in Scripture (Exodus 18:4): \"...and the name of the other [son of Moses] was 'Eliezer'...\", the same particular name.", 
        "18_Chapter, 8_Paragraph": "\"Take the rod ... give the congregation and their cattle drink\" -- From here [we learn] that the Holy One takes pity on Israel's money. \"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock\" -- similarly it says \"And all of the congregation he gathers to the door of the tent of meeting.\" This teaches that each one saw himself standing on the face of the rock. Likewise, when they crossed the Jordan, all of the Children of Israel entered between the staves of the ark, as it says (Joshua 3): \"Joshua said to the Children of Israel, come near and listen to the words of Hashem.\" [Similarly] here all of Israel were standing and seeing all of the miracles of the rock. They began to say \"Moses knows the rule of the rock. If he asks, it will bring forth water.\" So Moses was uncertain -- \"If I listen to them I nullify the words of the Allpresent, and the Holy One (Job 5:13) 'takes the wise in theןr craftiness.'\" But Moses had been careful for 40 years not to get angry at them, because he was terrified of the oath the Holy One swore: \"Not one of these men will see [the land]...\" They said to him: \"Here is a rock; just as you want to bring forth water from another rock, bring it forth from this one.\" He shouted at them \"Hear now, you rebels!\" \"Rebels (morim)\" has many meanings: 1) \"stubborn ones\" 2) \"fools\" -- in the sea villages they call fools \"morim\". 3) \"those who teach their teachers\" 4) \"archers\" (In I Sam 30:3 the word \"morim\" is used to mean \"archers\".)  ... Even so, Moses only used the rock that the Holy One told him [to use].", 
        "16_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "(1) \"When you come to the land of your dwellings\": What is the halacha of how many things a person is obligated to do for his son? Our rabbis taught: A person is obligated to do five things for his son. G-d can be compared to a father and the Jewish people to His son. Just like a father is obligated to circumcise his son, G-d did so for the Jews by circumcising them by the hand of Yehoshua as it says (Joshua 5:2) \"Make for yourself stone knives.\" A father is obligated to redeem his son [if he is a firstborn] and G-d redeemed the Jews, as it says [II Samuel 7:23) \"to redeem it as a nation.\" [A father is obligated] to teach [his son] Torah, [and] G-d taught the Jews Torah as it says (Deuteronomy 11:19) \"Teach them to your children\" and it is written \"I am G-d your teacher.\" [A father is obligated] to teach [his son] mitsvot, [and] G-d taught the mitsvot to the Jews. [A father is obligated] to marry [his son] to a woman, [and] G-d told mankind: \"Be fruitful and multiply.\" A father is obligated to his son [in the following ways]: to give him food and drink, to bathe him, to give him ointments, and to clothe him, and thus did G-d for the Jews, as it is written (Ezekiel 16: 9) \"And I washed you in water, and I washed away your blood...and I clothed you with embroidered clothing...and My bread which I gave you...\" [and in Numbers 21:17] \"Arise, o well, sing to it.\" What does a father give to a son? Possessions. Thus G-d did for the Jews, as it says in Jeremiah 3:18, \"And I gave you a beloved land.\" And what must a son give to his father? A gift. Thus G-d said to the Jews, \"When you come to the land...and bring an olah-offering to G-d.\"", 
        "18_Chapter, 7_Paragraph": "A gentile asked Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, \"These rituals you do, they seem like witchcraft! You bring a heifer, burn it, crush it up, and take its ashes. [If] one of you is impure by the dead [the highest type impurity], 2 or 3 drops are sprinkled on him, and you declare him pure?!\" He said to him, \"Has a restless spirit ever entered you?\" He said to him, \"No!\" \"Have you ever seen a man where a restless spirit entered him?\" He said to him, \"Yes!\" [Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai] said to him, \"And what did you do for him?\" He sad to him, \"We brought roots and made them smoke beneath him, and pour water and it flees.\" He said to him, \"Your ears should hear what leaves from your mouth! The same thing is true for this spirit, the spirit of impurity, as it is written, (Zachariah 13:2) \"Even the prophets and the spirit of impurity will I remove from the land.\" They sprinkle upon him purifying waters, and it [the spirit of impurity] flees.\" After he left, our rabbi's students said, \"You pushed him off with a reed. What will you say to us?\" He said to them, \"By your lives, a dead person doesn't make things impure, and the water doesn't make things pure. Rather, God said, 'I have engraved a rule, I have decreed a decree (chukah chakakti, gezeira gazarti), and you have no permission to transgress what I decreed, as it says \"This is a chok (rule) of the Torah.\"", 
        "22_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "A Halakha: <u>Is one who is pursued by non-Jews or bandits allowed to transgress the laws of Sabbath?</u> Our Rabbis taught: One who is pursued by non-Jews or bandits is permitted to transgress the laws of Sabbath, in order to save his life. Thus we also find with David: When Saul attempted to kill him, he fled and escaped. Our Rabbis said: It once happened that they came to the [Jewish] leadership in Sepphoris with harsh orders from the [Roman] government. They went and said to R. Elazar b. Parta: O Rabbi! We have received harsh orders from the government. What do you say we should do, should we flee? He feared telling them to flee explicitly, so he hinted to them: \"Why are you asking me? Go and ask Yaakov, Moshe, and David\". What does it say about Yaakov? (Hosea 12): \"And Jacob fled.\" Also about Moshe, (Exodus 2): \"Moshe fled.\" And also about David, (I Samuel 19): \"David fled and escaped.\" It also says (Isaiah 26): \"Go my people, enter your rooms.\" The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Such great ones were fearful and fled from those who hated them, yet for those forty years that you were in the desert, I did not let them flee. Instead I felled all their haters before them, in that I myself that was with them. Not only that, but there were all kinds of snakes, serafim, and scorpions there: (Deuteronomy 8): \"Snakes, sefarim, and scorpions\", yet I did not allow them to hurt you. Therefore The Holy One Blessed Be He said to Moshe: Record the journeys that Israel undertook in the desert, it order that they should know what kind of miracles I performed from them. How [will they know]? From all that they read regarding \"These are the journeys\".", 
        "20_Chapter, 9_Paragraph": "<b>And the daughters of Tzelophad approached:</b> In that generation, the women would seal what the men would puncture. As so do you find that Aharon said to them (Exodus 32:2), \"Remove the earrings of gold that are in the ears of your wives\" - and the women did not want and they protested against their husbands, as it is stated (Exodus 32:3), \"And the entire people removed the earrings of gold, etc.\" And the women did not participate with them in the [building of the] golden calf. And so [too] with the scouts that put out calumny: \"And they came back and they brought the entire congregation to complain\" (Numbers 14:36), and upon them was the decree decreed, as they [were the ones that] said, \"we cannot go up\" (Numbers 13:31). But the women were not with them in the counsel, as it it written beyond this section (Numbers 26:65), \"As God said to them, 'You shall surely die in the desert,' and not a man remained from them except for Calev the son of Yefuneh\" - [it is written] \"a man,\" but not a woman; because of [the men] not wanting to enter the land, but the women approached to request an inheritance in the land. Therefore, this section is written adjacent to the death of the generation of the wilderness (that came out of Egypt) - as from there did the men puncture and the women seal.", 
        "15_Chapter, 9_Paragraph": "These are the names of the men (Numbers 13:16): What were their names? Sethur the son of Michael; Nahbi the son of Vophsi; Geuel the son of Machi. There are people whose names are nice and whose actions are ugly, people whose names are ugly and actions are nice, people whose names and actions are nice, and people whose names and actions are ugly. Whose names are nice and whose actions are ugly - this is Ishmael and Esau: Ishmael means \"listens to God\" (\"<i>Shomea El</i>\"). Esau means \"does the will of his Maker\" (\"<i>Oseh Retzon Osav</i>\"). But their actions are bad. Whose names are ugly and whose actions are nice - these are those who ascended from exile: the children of Barak, the children of Sisera, and the children of Tamach. Whose names and actions are ugly - these are the spies. What is written about them? Sethur - that he closed him off (\"<i>setharo</i>\") from the world.", 
        "2_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "Another [explanation]: \"Bring close the tribe of Levi, etc.\" - this is [the meaning of] what is written (Psalms 65:5), \"Happy is the one whom You have chosen and You have brought close\": Happy is the one whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has chosen, even though he has not brought him close. And happy is the man that He has brought close, even though He has not chosen  him. And who is the one whom He has chosen? That is Avraham, as it is stated (Nehemiah 9:7), \"You are He, Lord God, Who chose Avram.\" But He did not bring him close, but rather he brought himself close. The Holy One, blessed be He, chose Yaakov, as it is stated (Psalms 135:4), \"For Yaakov did the Lord choose.\" And so [too] it says (Isaiah 41:8), \"Yaakov whom You have chosen.\" But He did not bring him close, but rather he brought himself close, as it is stated (Genesis 25:27), \"Yaakov was a simple man that sat in tents.\" He chose Moshe, as it is stated (Psalms 106:23), \"were it not for Moshe, His chosen\"; but He did not bring him close. Happy are those that the Holy One, blessed be He, chose, even though He did not bring them close. Come and see - the Holy One, blessed be He, brought Yitro close, but He did not choose him. He brought Rachav the prostitute close but He did not choose her. Happy are these that whom He brought close, even though He did not choose them. A [Roman] matron asked Rabbi Yose, \"[Does] your God bring close whomever He wants (arbitrarily)?\" [So] he brought a basket of figs in front of her and she would choose a nice one, she would choose it and eat it. He said to her, \"You know how to choose, [does] the Holy One, blessed be He not know how to choose? The one whom He sees has good deeds, He chooses him and brings him close.\" Rabbi Nechemiah [said] in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitschak, \"Not all who are close are close, and not all who are distant are distant. There is one who is chosen and pushed off and brought close, [and] there is one who is chosen and pushed off and not brought close. Aharon was chosen - (I Samuel 2:28) 'And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for Me as a priest.' And he was pushed off - (Deuteronomy 9:20) 'And with Aharon did the Lord get angry.' And it is written [after the event that the last verse cited was referring to] (Exodus 28:1), 'And you should bring close to you Aharon your brother.' Shaul was chosen - (I Samuel 10:24) 'Have you seen the one that the Lord chose?' And he was pushed off - (ibid., 15:11) 'I have regretted that I have crowned Shaul, etc.' And he was not brought close [again] - (ibid., 16:1) 'And I have been disgusted with him from ruling over Israel.' David was chosen - (Psalms 78:70) 'And He chose David, His servant.' And he was pushed off - (II Samuel 15:16-17) 'And the king went out, and all of household on his heels,... and they stood in Beit Merchak.'\" Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, \"They excommunicated him. Nonetheless, he accepted his excommunication. This is [the meaning] of that which is written, (II Samuel 15:30) 'and David went up to the Ascent of Olives, he went up and cried, and his head was covered.'\" \"And he was brought close [again].\" Rabbi Yudan said, \"Eira Hayairi, the teacher of David, brought him close. This is what David says (Psalms 119:79), 'Let those that fear You (<i>yeirecha</i>) return to me, and they that know Your testimonies' - ['they that know'] is written as 'he that knows,' [meaning that]  Eira Hayairi was his teacher and brought [David] close.\" Rabbi Yehoshua of Sakhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, \"There are six that were chosen: the priesthood; the order of Levi; Israel; the monarchy of the house of David; Jerusalem; [and] the Temple. From where [do we know this about] the priesthood? Since it is written (I Samuel 2:28), 'And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for Me as a priest.'  From where [do we know this about] the order of Levi? As it is stated (Deuteronomy 18:5), 'As he was chosen by the Lord, your God.' From where [do we know this about]Israel? As it is stated (Ibid., 7:6), 'the Lord, your God, chose you.' From where [do we know this about] the monarchy of the house of David? As it is stated (Psalms 78:70), 'And He chose David, His servant.' From where [do we know this about] Jerusalem? As it is stated (I Kings 11:32), 'the city that you chose.' From where [do we know this about] the Temple? As it stated (II Chronicles 7:16), 'I have chosen and sanctified this house.'\" David [meant to say in Psalms 65:5], \"Happy is the one whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has chosen, and happy is the one that He has brought close. And who is the one who is doubly happy? The one that the Holy One, blessed be He, chose and brought close.\" And who is that? That is Aharon and [the tribe of] Levi. From where [do we know this about] Aharon? Since it is written (I Samuel 2:28), \"And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for Me as a priest.\" And from where [do we know] that He brought him close? As it is stated (Exodus 28:1), \"And you should bring close to you Aharon your brother.\" The Holy One, blessed be He chose Levi, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 18:5), \"As he was chosen by the Lord, your God.\" And from where [do we know] that He brought him close? As it is stated [here], \"Bring close the tribe of Levi, and stand [it up].\" And about them the verse (Psalms 65:5) says, \"Happy is the one whom You have chosen and You have brought close, who dwells in your courtyards\"; as you say (Numbers 3:7), \"And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation, etc.\"   [The continuation of Psalms 65:5 is:] \"let us be satiated from the good of Your house\" - that thy would eat from the tithes that were brought to the [Temple], as you would say (Numbers 18:21), \"To the house of Levi, behold, I have given all tithe in Israel for an inheritance, etc.\"  ", 
        "12_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "… they said to him: we said ours, now you say yours! He said to them: everywhere that it uses the phrase ‘and it will be’ indicates joy. \"And it will be on that day that the mountains shall drip with wine...\" (Yoel 4:18) “And it will be on that day that living water shall come forth from Jerusalem...\" (Zechariah 14:8) \"And it will be that on that day, the Lord shall continue…” (Isaiah 11:11) “And it shall come to pass on that day, a man shall keep alive a heifer of the herd…” (Isaiah 7:21) \"And it will be on that day, that a great shofar shall be sounded...\" (Isaiah 27:13) “And it will be that every survivor shall be in Zion…” (Isaiah 4:3) But it is also written “…and he was when Jerusalem was taken.” (Jeremiah 38:28) He replied to them: this also is joy and not sorrow, because on that very day the comforter was born and on that very day Israel took full recompense for all of their sins. As R’ Shmuel bar Nachman said: Israel took their full recompense for their sins on the day that the Holy Temple was destroyed, as it says “Your iniquity is complete, O daughter of Zion; He will no longer send you into exile…” (Lamentations 4:22)", 
        "11_Chapter, 13_Paragraph": "The tabernacle (Mishkan). This is like that which is written \"How goodly are your tents, Jacob\" (Numbers 24:5). \"How goodly are your tents, Jacob\" this is the tent of meeting (ohel moed) that is in the wilderness and in Shiloh and Nov and Gibon. \"Your dwelling places, Israel\" (ibid). Don't read \"your dwelling\" (mishkenotecha) but your forfeits Israel (machknotecha) since the tabernacle and Temple were forfeited by Israel because of their sin. How do we know this is true of the sanctuary? As it is said \"the Temple at Shiloh was abandoned , the tent which man dwelt in\" (Psalm 88:60) since it was abandoned by Israel which are called \"man,\" i.e. The sheep of my shepherding, are men (Ezekiel 34:31). How do we know it is true of the Temple? Since it says \"he poured out his wrath; he lit a fire in Zion\" (Lamentations 4:11)and is further says \"we have dealt injured you (havul)\"(Nechemiah 1:7) . This is the first temple as it is said, \"If you take your neighbors garment in a pledge (havul) ( (Exodus 22:25). So it is called tabernalce (Mishkan) since God said to Moses: Say to Israel that I will make you a tabernacle (or pledge) but if you sin I will take it back from their hands.", 
        "19_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "\"And Balak son of Zippor saw\": The Torah says (Deuteronomy 32) \"The Rock--perfect is His work for all of His ways are justice.\" Hashem did not give the non-Jews an opening to say in the future \"You have distanced us.\" What did Hashem do? Just like He set up kings and sages and prophets for the Jews, He set these up for the non-Jews. He set up Shlomo as a king over the Jews and the entire earth, and He did the same for Nebuchadnezzar. This one built the Beit Hamikdash and said \"How many praises and supplications there are!\" and this one destroyed it and scoffed and said (Isaiah 14): \"I will ascend to the heights of the clouds.\" He gave David riches, and he took his house for His Name. And he gave Haman riches, and he took an entire nation to be slaughtered. All the greatness that the Jews took, you find that the nations took. Another example: He set up Moshe for the Jews and Bilaam for the nations. Understand what the difference is between Jewish prophets and non-Jewish prophets? Jewish prophets exhort the people about their sins, as it says (Ezekiel 3): \"And you, son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman etc.\" And the prophet from among the nations caused a breach to drive the creations from the world. Not only this, but all the prophets were [given prophecy] from the attribute of mercy on the Jews and the non-Jews, as Yirmiyah said (Jeremiah 48): \"My heart to Moav is as pipes moan.\" And as Yechezkel said (Ezekiel 27): \"Son of man, lament for Tyre.\" And this cruel one stood to uproot an entire nation for no reason. Therefore the passage of Bilaam was written, to make it known why Hashem took away the holy spirit from non-Jews, for this one was from them and see what he did.",

Now because it is customary to drink wine in a basin – as you may gather from the text, \"They who drink wine in basins\" (Amos 6:6) – therefore, he brought a basin. Why \"of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary\"? As the numerical value of yayin (wine) is seventy, so there are shivim panim la’Torah (seventy facets/sides of Torah).", 
        "7_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "Man or woman, who does any of the sins etc. - Rabi Abahu says (Hosea 14:8): 'Those that dwell under His shadow' those are the gerim that come and have love for the shadow of the Holy One of Blessing. 'They shall grow as grain' in [the study of] Talmud. 'Shall blossom as vine' in [the study of] Aggadah. 'His memory/scent shall be as the wine of Lebanon' - said the Holy One of Blessing: \"The appreciation of the gerim is as dear to me as the wine that was poured on the altar [as libation.]\" And why does He call it [the altar] Lebanon (root LVN)? Because it whitens (maLViN) the sins of Israel like snow, as it is written (Isaiah 1:18) 'though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.' Rabi Shimon Bar Yochai says: because all the hearts (LeVavot) become happy due to it. As it says (Psalms 48:2): 'Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth.' And the rabbis say - because of the verse (II Kings 9:3) 'and My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.' Another interpretation: 'they will grow as grain' - they will make the essence, they are like Israel; as it is said (Zechariah 9:17) 'grain [for] the young men [of Israel]'. 'They shall blossom as vine', as [just like] Israel, as it says (Psalms 80:9) 'You plucked a vine from Egypt.' And so you find that, just as a portion of the Torah was written regarding one Israel and another - that if he misappropriated something of him, that he is obligated to a sacrifice, as it is written (Leviticus 5:21) 'If any one sin, and commit a trespass etc.' - so too you find that the Holy One of Blessing wrote a portion of the Torah regarding what goes on between Israel and gerim, that if a man from Israel steals from a ger, the judgement is as if he stole from another man from Israel. You find that regarding this it is written 'a sin that he sinned' and regarding stealing from a ger it is written 'from any sins of a man.' Regarding this one it is written 'and trespassed a trespass against the Lord' and regarding this one it is written 'to trespass a trespass against the Lord.' Regarding this one it is written: 'And it will be, when he sins and is guilty' and regarding the ger it is written 'and that soul will be guilty'. Regarding this one it is written: 'And he will pay with his head' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will return his guilt with his head'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will add his fifth' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will add a fifth'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will bring his guilt-offering to the Lord' and regarding stealing a ger it is written 'besides the ram for the kipurim'. Behold we have learned: that the essence of the gerim is like Israel's. Therefore, they will be as grain and blossom.", 
        "3_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "Another interpretation: \"Number all the first-born males...\" (Numbers 3:40) This is what is written (Song of Songs 6:8-9): \"There are threescore queens ... My dove, my undefiled, is but one ...\" Compare in parable to a person who had a sales-bundle of glass stones and would bring them them to the market, but would not notice their number, since he would not bring them out by number. He would go in to put them away and would not put them away by number, since he would not care about them, as they were glass. But he had one sales-bundle of precious pearls, and he would take it and bring it out by number and put it away by number. Similarly, so to speak, the Holy One Blessed be He said to the nations of the world, \"I have not assigned a number. Why? Because they are not important to me at all. As it says (Isaiah 40:17), 'All the nations are as nothing before Him.' But you are My children, as it says, (Isaiah 46:3), 'that are borne [by Me] from the birth ...' Therefore, I count you all the time.\" Therefore, it is said \"Number all the first-born males.\" That is: \"There are threescore queens ... My dove, my undefiled, is but one ...\" - these are Israel."
