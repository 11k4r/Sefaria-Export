It is revealed and known before You that at the time You said to me “Take your son, your only one,” it was in my heart to reply against You, and I had what to say in my heart: ‘Earlier You said to me ‘it is through Isaac that offspring shall be continued for you.’ But now You say to me, ‘offer him there as a burnt-offering!’ So, just as I could have replied against You, but I suppressed my desire and did not argue with You…so too, when the children of Isaac come into transgressions and bad deeds, keep in mind for them the binding of Isaac their father, and rise from the seat of judgment to the seat of mercy and be filled with mercy for them, and be merciful to them and turn the quality of judgment to the quality of mercy.

This verse was only stated for the sake of the lulav (the four species).  The spine of the palm branch is similar to the spine of man. And the myrtle is similar to the eye. And the willow is similar to the mouth. And the etrog (citron), is similar to the heart.

In the moment when the Holy Blessing One sits on the Throne of Judgement, God ascends with judgement. What happens? God ascends with acclimation, at the time when Israel takes their shofarot and sounds them before the Holy Blessing One, God stands up from the Throne of Judgement and sits on the Throne of Mercy, as it says, \"Adonai in the call of the shofar,\" And they are filled with mercy and God has mercy on them, and switches their treatment from the attribute of judgement to the attribute of mercy.

        "8_Chapter, 8_Paragraph": "Said Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai: Peace is so great that all blessings are included in it (Ps. 29:11) “Hashem will give strength to His people, Hashem will bless His people with peace”. Hizkiah said two things. Hizkiah said: Peace is so great that all mitzvot are written [in the conditional form] (Exodus 23:4-5) “If you see” “If you encounter” (Deut. 22:6) “If you happen by” – if a mitzvah came to your hand, you are bound to do it. However, here (Ps. 34:15) “Seek peace and pursue it.” Seek – [this word applies] in your own place; pursue – [this word applies] in any other place. Hizkiah said gave another explanation: Peace is so great that about every travelling of the children of Israel it is written ‘and they travelled’ ‘and they encamped’ they travelled disputing [with each other] and encamped disputing. But when they arrived at Mount Sinai they did one single encampment, as it is written ‘and Israel encamped [verb in singular] there’ – it is not written ‘they encamped there’, rather, it is written ‘he encamped there.’ At the moment the Holy One of Blessing said ‘this is the moment I will give Torah to the children of Israel’", 
        "29_Chapter, 11_Paragraph": "Another explanation: \"The fruit of a beautiful tree\" - these are [referring to] Israel. Just like this citron (etrog), which has taste and has smell, so too Israel has among them people that have Torah and have good deeds. \"The branches of a date palm\" - these are [referring to] Israel. Just like this date, which has taste and has no smell, so too Israel has among them those that have  Torah but do not have good deeds. \"And a branch of a braided tree (a myrtle)\" - these are [referring to] Israel. Just like this myrtle, which has smell and has no taste, so too Israel has among them those that have good deeds but do not have Torah.  \"And brook willows\" - these are [referring to] Israel. Just like this willow, which has no smell and has no taste, so too Israel has among them people that have no Torah and have no good deeds. And what does the Holy One, blessed be He, do to them? To destroy them is impossible, but rather  the Holy One, blessed be He, said \"bind them all together [into] one grouping and these will atone for those.\" And if you will have done that, I will be elevated at that time. This is [the meaning of] what is written (Amos 9:6), \"He Who built the upper chambers in the heavens\" (indicating his elevation). And when is He elevated? When they make one grouping, as it is stated (Ibid.), \"and established His grouping on the earth.\" Hence Moshe warned Israel, \"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day.\"",

        "8_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "Another opinion regarding the verse (Ps. 50:23) “And there is a path, I will show him the salvation of God”- Rabbi Yanai said: the it is written the one who puts a path[with a sin and not a shin], meaning that two ways are similar [in bringing one to salvation] Rabbi Yannai was once walking along the road, and saw a man who was extremely well dressed. Rabbi Yannai said to him: Would you like to come over to my house? The man replied: Yes. Rabbi Yannai brought him into his home, and gave him food and drink. As they were eating and drinking together, he examined him in his knowledge of Bible, and found out that he had none; examined his knowledge of Mishnah, and realized that he had none; his knowledge of legends, and saw that he had none; his knowledge of Talmud and saw he had none. Rabbi Yannai then told him: Wash and recite grace. Said the guest: Let Yannai recite grace in his own home. Seeing that he could not even recite a blessing, Yannai told him: Can you at least repeat what I say? Said he: Yes. Said Rabbi Yannai: repeat the following: 'A dog has eaten Yannai's bread.' Offended, the man stood up, and grabbed Rabbi Yannai by the coat! He then said: My inheritance is with you, and you are withholding it from me! Said Rabbi Yannai with puzzlement: What legacy of yours is there with me? He replied: Once I passed by a school, and I heard the voices of the little children saying: 'Moses gave us the Torah, the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.' They did not say 'the inheritance of the congregation of Yannai,' but the 'congregation of Jacob.' Rabbi Yannai asked, “How then are you worthy to eat at my table?” The guest replied, “Never have I heard an evil word spoken against me and returned to argue with the person who spoke it. Never have I seen two people arguing without making peace between them.” Rabbi Yannai then said, “you have so much Derech Eretz and I called you a dog.” On him rabbi Yanai said the verse “And there is a path” – meaning not one, but two paths take you to salvation – since rabbi Ishmael son of rav Nachman said: Derech eretz precedes Torah by 26 generations, since it is written “and to guard the way to the Tree of Life” (Genesis 3). “Way” is the derech eretz, and only after that comes “Tree of Life” which is Torah. [Back to the verse in question, Ps 50:23] I will show him the salvation of God, said rabbi Abahu: this is one of the sources for the idea that God’s salvation is Israel’s salvation (Ps. 80:3) “and come and save us”",

Evyon [one who longs] because he longs (mita’ev) for everything.  Misken [despised] because he is despised by all as it says “The poor man’s (misken) wisdom is despised.” (Eccl 9:16).  Rash [impoverished] because he is dispossessed (mitroshesh) of property.  Dal [detached] because he is detached (meduldal) from property.  Dach [oppressed] because he is crushed (meduchdach); he sees a thing but cannot eat it, he sees a thing and cannot taste it, and cannot drink it. Mach [trampled upon] because he is lowly before everyone, like a kind of lowest threshold. Helech [vagrant] or Chelech [weak]. Therefore Moses warns Israel: \"if your brother becomes poor…\"",

This is as Iyob said (Job 19:4): \"If indeed I have erred, my error remains with me.\" But his friends said to him (Job 34:37): \"He adds transgression to his sin; he extends it among us.\" [The men on the ship said]: You extend your sins among us. Rabbi Elasa said: a gentile asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha: In your Torah, it is written (Exodus 23:2): \"After the multitude will you side.\" We are more numerous than you, so why don't you become like us in practicing idolatry? He [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha] said to him: Do you have children? He replied: You reminded me of my troubles. He asked: Why? [The gentile] said: I have many children. When they sit at my table, this one blesses to this god and that one blesses to that god, and they don't get up from the table until they wrack each other's brains. He [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha] said: Do you settle [the arguments] with them? He said: No. He [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha] said: Before you make us agree with you, find agreement with your own children! [The gentile] was spurned and went away. After he left [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karha's] students said to him: Rabbi! You pushed him away like a broken reed, but what would you answer for us? He said to them: Six souls are about written [in the Torah] about Esau, and \"souls\" [nefashot] is written in the plural, as stated (Genesis 36:6): \"Esau took his wives, his sons and daughters, and all the souls of his household.\" For Yaakov, however, there were seventy souls, and soul [nefesh] is written [in the Torah] in the singular. As it is stated (Exodus 1:5): \"And all of the people [nefesh] that were of Jacob's issue, etc.\" Because Esau worshipped many gods, it is written many \"souls,\" but for Yaakov--who worshipped one God--it is written one soul, \"And all of the people [nefesh], etc.\"",

He would shout out and say, \"Who wants to buy the [potion] of life?\" They would [all] cling to him. Rabbi Yannai was sitting and interpreting [texts] in his reception room [and] heard him shouting out, \"Who wants to buy the [potion] of life?\" [Rabbi Yannai] said, \"Come down to here, sell [it] to me.\" He said [back] to him, \"You do not need it and those like you do not [need it].\" [Nonetheless,] he made the effort to come and go down to him.

He [Titus] began to revile and blaspheme saying, “He who wages battle with a king in the desert and triumphs is different from him who wages battle in the king's own palace and vanquishes him.” What did he [Titus] do? He gathered all of the Temple vessels and put them in a sack and descended to a ship.  At sea, a wave rose up to drown him.  He said, “It would appear that this nation's god has power only on water.  He [God] only punished the generation of Enosh with water, likewise He could only punish the generation of the flood with water, the generation of the Dispersal and Pharaoh and his army were only punished with water.  So I, when I was in His house and domain He had no power to stand against me, and now he opposes me here!”  The Holy One said, “By your life, I will punish you with the most insignificant of my creatures.”  Immediately God hinted to the sea and it stayed its anger. When he arrived in Rome, all of the citizens came out and acclaimed him: “Conqueror of the Barbarians.”  Immediately they heated the bath-house and he entered and washed himself.  When he came out they poured for him the double glass for after the bath, and God appointed a mosquito for him and it entered his nose and gnawed its way up until it reached his brain.  He said, “Call for the doctors to split open the head of that man [Titus] so I can know with what the God of that nation has punished him.”  Forthwith they summoned the doctors, and they split open his brain and found in it the likeness of a young dove and its weight was two litras.  R. Elazar son of R. Yosi said: I was there, and they put the young bird on one side [of the scales], and two litras on the other, and they balances one another.

As if it were possible, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'take Me and I will dwell among you' - it does not say, 'and they shall take an offering,' but rather, 'and they shall take (for) Me:' they are taking Me. I said to you (Leviticus 24:2), 'and they shall take to you pure olive oil.' And do I need your light - behold, it is written (Daniel 2:22), 'and light dwells with Him?' But rather to give you merit and to atone for your souls which is compared to a candle, as it is stated (Proverbs 20:27), 'The candle of God is the soul of a man, it searches all of the chambers of the innards.'

A fetus that rests in the womb of his mother, The Holy Blessed One guards him so he does not fall and die, is this not praiseworthy?!  Thus - \"Life and lovingkindness you have given me.\"  Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said also: It is the way of the world that an animals breasts are in the place of the womb and the newborn nurses in a shameful place.  But a woman, her breasts are in a beautiful place, and the newborn nurses in a place of honor.  Is this not \"life and lovingkindness?\"  Thus - \"Life and lovingkindness you have given me.\"  Rabbi Elazar said, if a person tarries in a hot place for one hour, does he not die?   Yet the womb of the woman boils, and the fetus which is placed inside the womb, The Holy Blessed One protects it, it is not aborted in the shape of a bag, it is not aborted as the placenta, nor aborted in the shape of a sandal - is this not \"life and lovingkindess?\"  Thus - \"Life and lovingkindness you have given me.\"  Rabbi Tachalifa of Cesaerea If a person eats one portion of food after another portion of food, does not the second portion expel the first?  But no matter how much food a woman eats or how much liquid she drinks, the fetus is not expelled - is this not \"life and lovingkindness?\"   Rabbi Simon said, the womb of a woman is made with many cavities, many coils, and many bands.  At the moment that a woman sits on the birth chair, (the baby) does not get cast out all at once. There is a saying, \"If one band is loosened, two bands are loosened\".  Rabbi Meir said: All nine months that a woman does not see blood, she really should have seen it.  What did The Holy Blessed One do?  He removed (the blood) upward to her breasts and made it milk, so that when the baby was born there would be food for him to eat.
