        "9_Vayishlach, 9_Siman, 5_Paragraph": "The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: In this world you sin because of the evil inclination within you, and therefore you are subservient to other nations. Nevertheless, My Shekhinah will not depart from you, as it is said: <i>In all their afflictions He was afflicted</i> (Isa. 63:9). In their rejoicing, He rejoiced, as is said: <i>Because I rejoice in Thy salvation</i> (I Sam. 2:1). And He also said: <i>I will rejoice in Jerusalem and rejoice in My people</i> (Isa. 65:49). And it says also: <i>And as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee</i> (ibid. 62:5). Hence, <i>all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth</i>.", 
        "15_Vaera, 9_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "<i>And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart</i>, etc. (Exod. 7:3). The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: Moses, you shall speak, and I will bring the plague. Moreover, He stated, in this world I will obtain retribution from the Egyptians through the ten plagues, but in the future I will obtain retribution for you from Gog and Magog, as it is said: <i>And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; I will cause to rain upon him, and upon his bands and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing shower</i> (Ezek. 38:22).", 
        "23_Vayakhel, 4_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "The Temple was similarly constructed by means of these three attributes, as it is said: <i>He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, and he was filled with wisdom, understanding, and skill</i> (I Kings 7:14). Similarly, the Temple will be rebuilt in the future with these three attributes, as is said: <i>Through wisdom is a house builded, and by understanding it is established; and by knowledge are the chambers filled with all precious and pleasant riches</i> (Prov. 24:3–4). Therefore, <i>And He hath filled him with the spirit of God</i>. Where did all this wisdom come from? From the spirit of God. <i>And He filled him with the spirit of God</i> alludes also to Joshua, who descended from the tribe of Ephraim, as it is written: <i>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom</i> (Deut. 34:9). And it refers as well to Othniel the son of Kenaz, who came from the tribe of Judah, since it is written about him: <i>And the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel</i> (Judg. 3:10). All this happened because Moses blessed the tribe: <i>And this for Judah, and he said: “Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; his hands shall contend for him, and Thou shalt be a help against his adversaries”</i> (Deut. 33:7). When they become involved in difficulties, You shall be a help to them.", 
        "22_Ki Tisa, 25_Siman, 4_Paragraph": "<i>I will send an angel before thee … unto a land flowing with milk and honey … if I go in the midst of thee, even for a moment, I shall consume thee</i> (Exod. 33:2, 5). How long is <i>a moment</i>? R. Samuel the son of Abba maintained: It is one fifty-eighth thousandth, six hundred and fiftieth part of an hour. <i>That I may know what to do unto thee</i> (ibid.). I will give them the Day of Atonement that it may atone for them. <i>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments</i> (ibid., v. 6). (The ornaments) were the crowns which they had received at Mount Horeb. <i>And they stripped themselves of them</i>—unwillingly.", 
        "19_Mishpatim, 9_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>The two different items that were pledged—habol tahbol.</b><sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though Exod. 22:25 speaks only of night garments, the repetition of the word <i>haval</i> (<i>havol tahbol</i>) indicates that two different pledges are referred to, and thus that it also refers to implements required in the daytime.</i><b></b> The verse teaches us that if one borrows the pin of a plow, he must return it upon awakening. In one verse Scripture says: <i>Thou shalt restore the garment unto him before the sun goeth down</i> (Exod. 22:25). And another verse states: <i>Neither shall the sun go down</i> (Deut. 24:15). From these verses you can conclude that just as you must return the garment in which a man sleeps in the evening, as it is said: <i>When the sun goeth down</i>, so you must return the pin of the plow to him in the morning, <i>before the sun goeth down</i>. Furthermore, <i>In the same day thou shalt give him his hire</i> (Deut. 24:15). Why? Since he is poor. It states likewise: <i>For that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin, wherein shall he sleep?</i> (Exod. 22:26). If he does not have his garment, he will suffer from the cold during the night and <i>will cry unto Me and I will hear him</i> (ibid.). Two matters, similar to each other, are treated here, a pledge and a man’s hire.", 
        "5_Vayera, 5_Siman, 8_Paragraph": "Another explanation of <i>Then he openeth the ears of men</i>: This alludes to Abraham, for it is said: <i>And God said: Shall I hide from Abraham?</i>, and <i>By their chastisement sealeth the decree</i> (Job 33:16) refers to the Sodomites, against whom He sealed the decree when a single righteous man could not be found amongst them. Another comment on <i>And the Lord said: Shall I hide from Abraham?</i> Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: <i>For the Lord will do nothing, but He revealeth His counsel unto His servants, the prophets</i> (Amos 3:7). In the beginning the Holy One, blessed be He, used to reveal His secrets to those who feared Him, as it is said: <i>The counsel of the Lord is with them that fear Him</i> (Ps. 25:14). Then He made His secrets known to the righteous, as is said: <i>In the council of the upright and in the congregation</i> (Ps. 111:1); and finally He revealed it only to the prophets, as it is said: <i>But He revealeth His counsel unto His servants, the prophets</i>. After Israel transgressed at the time of Achan,<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When Achan took spoils in Jericho despite the warning not to, punishment was visited upon the whole people (Judg. 7).</i> the Holy One, blessed be He, informed Joshua, as it is said: <i>Israel hath sinned</i> (Josh. 7:11). When Eli’s sons sinned,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Eli’s sons sinned by keeping a woman who had brought an offering to the sanctuary waiting. Because of this they returned home without completing their sacrifice and therefore indulged in conjugal relations in a condition of impurity.</i> the Holy One, blessed be He, disclosed it to Samuel, as is said: <i>And the Lord called Samuel</i> (I Sam. 3:4). When the Sodomites sinned, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed it to Abraham, as is said: <i>Shall I hide from Abraham?</i>",

        "23_Vayakhel, 4_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>See, he hath called by name Bezalel (Exod. 35:30).</b> Observe what He did for Bezalel. The Holy One, blessed be He, instilled wisdom in his heart, as it is said: <i>And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge</i> (ibid., v. 31). It was with these attributes the Holy One, blessed be He, created His world, as it is said: <i>The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens; by knowledge the depths were broken up</i> (Prov. 3:19–20). With these same attributes Bezalel erected the Tabernacle.", 
        "19_Mishpatim, 2_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>Now these are the ordinances (Gen. 21:1).</b> R. Abahu said in the name of R. Yosé the son of Zimra: Whenever the word <i>eleh</i> (“these”) is written, the lack of importance of the earlier generations is indicated, but whenever <i>ve’eleh</i> (“now these”) is written, it adds to the importance of later generations and bestows praise upon earlier generations. It is possible to explain every instance in which this phrase occurs in accordance with this statement. Hence the verse <i>Now these are the ordinances</i> adds praise to earlier generations, as it is said: <i>There he made for them a statute and an ordinance</i> (Exod. 15:25). That is, <i>Which thou shalt set before them</i> (Exod. 21:1)—but not before idolaters.", 
        "7_Toldot, 13_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "From whom will the Messiah descend? From Zerubbabel. Why was he called Zerubbabel? Because he was born in Babel (Babylonia). From whom did Zerubbabel descend? From David, as it is said: <i>And Solomon’s son was Rehoboam; Abijah his son … and Delaiah, and Anani, seven</i> (I Chron. 3:10–24). To whom does <i>Anani</i> refer? To the Messiah, as is said: <i>For who hath despised the day of small things? Even they shall see with joy the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel, even these seven</i> (Zech. 4:10). And it is written elsewhere: <i>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, there came with clouds (ananei) of heaven, one like unto a son of man</i> (Dan. 7:13).", 
        "3_Noach, 3_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "R. Yohanan was of the opinion that a man who steals as little as a perutah from his companion is considered as though depriving him of his life, as it is said: <i>So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof</i> (Prov. 1:19).", 
        "3_Noach, 2_Siman, 10_Paragraph": "What do the words <i>craftsmen and smiths</i> imply? The word “craftsmen” (<i>haras</i>) indicates that when one of them spoke, all the others were made speechless (<i>haresin</i>) by the power of his argument. The word “smiths” signifies that when one of them closed a case (playing on <i>mesager</i>, “smith,” and <i>soger</i>, “close”), on purity or impurity, prohibition or permission, no one in all the world was able to reopen the argument. This was in fulfillment of the verse <i>And the key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder, and he shall open and none shall shut; and he shall shut and none shall open</i> (Isa. 22:22).", 
        "4_Lech Lecha, 5_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel (Gen. 14:1).</b> May it please our master to teach us when a proselyte who has been converted on the eve of the Passover is permitted to partake of the paschal lamb. Thus did our masters instruct us: The School of Shammai maintained: Let him undergo ritual immersion and then he may partake of the paschal lamb offering in the evening. The School of Hillel taught: One who is circumcised is like one who leaves a burial site.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He must wash his hands, like one who returns from the cemetery, and then he may eat. Pesahim 92a, Buber Tanhuma 5.</i>", 
        "3_Noach, 8_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Further proof that they did not sleep is presented to us by R. Yohanan. He tells us in the name of R. Eliezer the son of R. Yosé the Galilean that because Noah once delayed feeding a lion, the lion bit him so severely that he left the ark crippled, as it is said: <i>And only Noah was left</i> (Gen. 7:23). The word <i>ah</i> (“only,” also “to be afflicted”) indicates that his body was no longer whole. He became, thereby, unfit to bring sacrifices to the altar,<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">No person with a blemish on his body was permitted to bring a sacrifice to the altar.</i> and his son Shem had to do it in his stead. Concerning him it is said: <i>Behold, the righteous shall be made whole in the earth</i> (Prov. 11:31).", 
        "22_Ki Tisa, 30_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>Hew these two tablets of stone (Exod. 34:1).</b> When did Moses descend from the mountain? R. Judah the son of Shalum said: Moses remained on the mountain with the Holy One, blessed be He, for one hundred and twenty days. How did he arrive at this conclusion? From the verse <i>In the third month after the children of Israel were gone out of the land of Egypt</i> (Exod. 19:1). On the sixth day of that month He gave him the Ten Commandments, as it is written concerning him: <i>And Moses went up into the mountain of God</i> (ibid. 24:13). He remained there for forty days, that is, the twenty-four days of the month of Sivan and the sixteen days of the month of Tammuz—totaling forty days in all. He descended from the mountain on the seventeenth day of Tammuz, and on the eighteenth day and nineteenth day he saw the calf, broke the tablets, and halted their revelry. On the twentieth day he turned and ascended once again, as is said: <i>And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses said unto the people: “Ye have sinned a great sin; and now I will go up unto the Lord”</i> (ibid. 32:30). And it is written: <i>And Moses returned unto the Lord and said: “Oh, this people have sinned a great sin”</i> (ibid, v. 31). He remained there the ten days of the month of Tammuz and the entire month of Av, totaling another forty days. He went up on the first day of the month of Elul when He told him: <i>Hew thee these two tablets … and be ready by the morning</i> (ibid. 34:1–2). <i>And he hewed … and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto Mount Sinai</i> (ibid., v. 4). He stayed there throughout the month of Elul and until the tenth day of Tishri (another ten days). On the tenth day of Tishri he descended while the Israelites were praying and fasting. On that day He said to him: <i>I have pardoned according to thy word</i> (Num. 14:20). Then the Holy One, blessed be He, established that day as the day of forgiveness and pardon for the future generations (Yom Kippur), as it is said: <i>For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you</i> (Lev. 16:30). Thereupon He commanded Moses: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary</i> (Exod. 25:8).", 
        "19_Mishpatim, 11_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>If thou lend money to any of my people (Exod. 22:24).</b> Scripture states elsewhere in reference to this verse: <i>Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth, that ordereth his affairs rightfully, for he shall never be moved</i> (Ps. 112:5). All of God’s creations borrow from each other; day borrows from night, and night from day, but they do not bring charges against each other in court as mortals do, for it is said: <i>Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night revealeth knowledge; there is no speech, there are no words</i> (Ps. 19:3).", 
        "12_Vayigash, 8_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And he sent Judah before him (Gen. 46:28).</b> Scripture states elsewhere in reference to this verse: <i>The envy also of Ephraim shall depart … Ephraim shall not envy Judah</i> (Isa. 11:13). Jacob our patriarch sent Judah before him because he believed that Judah had killed Joseph at the time he brought him the coat of many colors, as it is said: <i>And he knew it, and said: “It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him”</i> (Gen. 37:33). <i>An evil beast</i> refers to Judah, since it is said: <i>Judah is a lion’s whelp</i>. And Jacob said to Judah: “Thou art the one who hath rent him asunder.” <i>Whereupon Jacob rent his garments … and all his sons and daughters rose up to comfort him</i> (ibid., vv. 34–35).", 
        "13_Vayechi, 16_Siman, 4_Paragraph": "<i>And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead</i>, etc. (Gen. 50:13). What did they see that frightened them? As they were returning from the burial of their father, they saw their brother go to the pit into which they had hurled him, in order to bless it. He blessed the pit with the benediction “Blessed be the place where He performed a miracle for me,” just as any man is required to pronounce a blessing at the place where a miracle had been performed in his behalf. When they beheld this they cried out: Now that our father is dead, Joseph will hate us and will fully requite us for all the evil which we did unto him. And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying: <i>Thy father did command … “So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive”</i> (Gen. 50:15–16). We have searched the entire Scripture and are unable to find any place where Jacob uttered this remark. This statement is introduced to teach us the importance of peace. The Holy One, blessed be He, wrote these words in the Torah for the sake of peace alone.", 
        "22_Ki Tisa, 33_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And the Lord said unto Moses: “Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel” (Exod. 34:27).</b> Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: <i>Though I write for him never so many things of My Law, they are accounted as stranger’s</i> (Hos. 8:12). R. Judah the son of Shalum was of the opinion that when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses <i>Write thou</i>, Moses wanted to write the Mishnah as well. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, foresaw that ultimately the nations of the world would translate the Torah into the Greek language and would claim: “We are the Israelites.”", 
        "22_Ki Tisa, 4_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "R. Jonah of Bozrah and the rabbis disagreed concerning the meaning of this verse. The rabbis maintained that it refers to Aaron. Because of the word <i>this</i> (in the preceding verse) he was humbled, as it is said: <i>And I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf</i> (Exod. 32:24), and because of the word <i>this</i> he was exalted, as is said: <i>This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons</i> (Lev. 6:13). R.Jonah, however, was of the opinion that this verse refers to Israel: With the word <i>this</i> they debased themselves, and with the word <i>this</i> they exalted themselves. With the word <i>this</i> they debased themselves in saying: <i>As for this man Moses</i> (Exod. 32:1), and with the word <i>this</i> they exalted themselves, as it is said: <i>This they shall give</i> (ibid. 30:13). Scripture states elsewhere: <i>Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin is a reproach to any people</i> (Prov. 14:34). R. Joshua said: <i>Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people</i> is indicated by the fact that when Israel sinned, the nations of the world turned against them and enslaved them.", 
        "10_Vayeshev, 0_Siman, 4_Paragraph": "You find likewise (that the expression <i>sat</i> also alludes to) the degeneracy of the descendants of Seir, since it is written: <i>These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who sat on the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah</i> (Gen. 36:20). However, Anah is elsewhere called the son of Zibeon: <i>And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah</i> (ibid., v. 24). We learn from this that Zibeon had sexual relations with his own mother, and conceived and begot Anah by her. Consequently, (Anah) was both (Zibeon’s) brother and his son. Later he had intercourse with his daughter-in-law, the wife of Anah, and Oholibamah was their child, as it is said: <i>And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife</i> (ibid., v. 14), and Esau took her as a wife. Inasmuch as they were all products of incestuous relations, Scripture mentions them only to disclose their degeneracy.", 
        "15_Vaera, 4_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "R. Hiyya the son of Abba declared: It would have been far better for Solomon to have been a cleaner of fish ponds, for then that verse could not have been written concerning him. What made him devote himself to so many things for which he had no need, and what were these things? <i>The things of Agur the son of Jakeh; the burden. The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal</i> (Prov. 30:1): Why was he called <i>Agur</i>? He was called <i>Agur</i> because he stored up (<i>anigur</i>) knowledge of the Torah and wisdom, and <i>the son of Jakeh</i> because he rejected (<i>hekiah</i>) them. <i>The man saith unto Ithiel</i> is written because he would say: “God is with me” (<i>iti-el</i>), and I will be able (<i>ukhal</i>) to withstand temptation.” The Holy One, blessed be He, wrote in the Torah: <i>Neither shall he multiply wives unto himself, that his heart turn not away; neither silver and gold … only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return</i> (Deut. 17:17, 16).", 
        "17_Beshalach, 27_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "<i>I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek</i> (Exod. 17:14). <i>Utterly</i> refers to this world; <i>I will blot out</i> alludes to the world-to-come; <i>the remembrance</i> refers to Haman, while <i>Amalek</i> is to be understood in its usual sense.", 
        "19_Mishpatim, 4_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "His advisor responded: “Then if that is so, why bother with him now that he is converted? Have him put to death.” Whereupon, he answered: “Even while my nephew Aquila was in his mother’s womb, he was destined to be converted.” What did Hadrian’s advisor do then? He went to the roof, threw himself off, and perished. The Holy Spirit then cried out: <i>So perish all thine enemies, O Lord</i> (Judg. 5:31).", 
        "3_Noach, 2_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "The Israelites did not accept the Torah until the Holy One, blessed be He, arched the mountain over them like a vessel, as it is said: <i>And they stood beneath the mountain</i> (Exod. 19:17). R. Dimi the son of Hama stated that the Holy One, blessed be He, told Israel: If you accept the Torah, well and good; but if not, your grave will be there. If you should say that He arched the mountain over them because of the Written Law, isn’t it true that as soon as He said to them, “Will you accept the Torah?” they all responded, “We will do and hear,” because the Written Law was brief and required no striving and suffering, but rather He threatened them because of the Oral Law. After all, it contains the detailed explanations of the commandments, both simple and difficult, and it is as severe as death, and as jealous as Sheol. One does not study the Oral Law unless he loves the Holy One, blessed be He, with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, as it is said: <i>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might</i> (Deut. 6:5).", 
        "11_Miketz, 5_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Another comment on <i>I have been young, and now am old</i>. This verse suggests that the Holy One, blessed be He, will never abandon the righteous during a time of famine, neither they nor their descendants. In fact, when a disaster envelops the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, decrees how they will survive. You find this to be so in the case of Elijah, whom He told how to survive, as it is said: <i>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee</i> (I Kings 17:9). Similarly you find: <i>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there</i> (ibid., vv. 3–4). <i>And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine</i> (Gen. 26:1); <i>and there was a famine in the land; and Abraham descended</i> (ibid. 12:10). Similarly, when the famine came upon Jacob, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to him that Joseph would feed him in Egypt, as it is said: <i>And Joseph fed his father and his brothers</i> (Gen. 47:12). Hence, <i>Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt</i>.", 
        "15_Vaera, 1_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>Therefore, say unto the children of Israel: “I am the Lord, and I will bring you out” (Exod. 6:6).</b> The word <i>therefore</i> implies that an oath was involved, as it is said: <i>Therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli</i> (I Sam. 3:14). Moses went to them and told them what the Holy One, blessed be He, had said: <i>And Moses spoke so unto the children of Israel; but they harkened not unto Moses for impatience of spirit and for cruel bondage</i> (Exod. 6:9). Whereupon Moses turned to the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: <i>Behold, the children of Israel have not harkened unto me</i> (ibid., v. 12). <i>And the Lord said to Moses: “Go in, say unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go”</i> (ibid., v. 11). A proverb states: “There is no benefit to be derived from acacia wood except when it is cut down.”<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An old proverb indicating that one must wait until an episode is concluded to learn the result. “Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched.”</i>",

After the people had made the golden calf the demons attacked Moses. He pleaded for mercy, recalling the merit of the patriarchs and they departed from him. When he broke the tablets his anger diminished. What did Moses witness that compelled him to break the tablets? It may be compared to a king who travels abroad while his wife remains at home with the servants. Because she was alone with them, rumors began to circulate concerning her behavior. The king heard them, and when he returned home, he wanted to kill her. His advisor learned this and tore up her marriage certificate. He said: “If the king should say, my wife has done such and such, we can reply, she is no longer your wife.” The king inquired about her and found that she had done nothing wrong. Only the maidservants had acted shamefully. He became reconciled with her immediately. His advisor then said to him: “Master, write another marriage contract, since the first one was torn up.” “You tore it up,” the king replied, “so now you must bring the parchment and I will write the document with my own hand.” So too here. When the Israelites made the calf, the Holy One, blessed be He, felt the same way. He said to Moses: <i>Go, get thee down, for thy people have dealt corruptly</i>. Whereupon he replied: They are Your people and Your inheritance. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: This act proves that <i>The ox knoweth his owner</i> (Isa. 1:3). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the calf: Who made you? The calf answered: The mixed multitude that departed from Egypt with the Israelites, for it is written about them: <i>Whose flesh is as the flesh of asses</i> (Ezek. 23:20). Then the Holy One, blessed be He, said: Did I not tell you: <i>Go, get thee down, for thy people that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt have dealt corruptly</i> (Exod. 32:7) and have made the golden calf. My people did not do it, as it is said: <i>But Israel doth not know, My people doth not consider</i> (Isa. 1:3). Immediately Moses arose and pleaded in their defense: <i>O Lord God, destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance that Thou hast redeemed through Thy greatness</i> (Deut. 9:26). And he went ahead and broke the tablets. When the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled, He told him: <i>Go, hew these two tablets</i> of stone.",

It is written: <i>All that see them shall acknowledge them</i> (Isa. 61:9). How do we know about his stature? It is written: <i>I will make you go upright</i> (<i>komemiut</i>) (Lev. 26:13). The word <i>komemiut</i> indicates that each Israelite will be one hundred cubits tall. R. Simeon the son of Yohai held, however, that each Israelite will be two hundred cubits tall. The word <i>komah</i> would indicate one hundred cubits, while the word <i>komemiut</i> signifies two hundred cubits.<sup>23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>komah</i> (“stature”) can be read as <i>kemeah</i> (“about a hundred), while the final part of komemiut can be seen as the plural “hundreds.”</i> How do we know about his immortality?

He answered Moses: Do you desire to know My name? I am known according to My works. When I judge mankind, I am called God; when I take revenge upon the wicked, I am called Hosts; when I consider the sins of man, I am called Almighty God; and when I sit in merciful judgment, I am called Merciful One.

He replied: <i>I have eaten of all</i> (ibid.); that is, everything that the Holy One, blessed be He, created during the six days of creation was contained in the food I ate before you entered, and I blessed him. Isaac desired to withdraw the blessing he had conferred upon Jacob and to declare instead: “Cursed shall ye be,” but the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked him, saying: What are you doing? You are, in fact, cursing yourself, for you said to him: <i>Cursed be everyone that curseth thee, and blessed be everyone that blesseth thee</i> (ibid., v. 29).

It is written: <i>The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Beth-el, one</i>; etc. (Josh. 12:9). Scripture mentions this though the distance between Jericho and Ai was only three mils (6,000 cubits). It does so to show that every king who ruled outside of the land of Israel would have not been called a king if he did not possess a strip of the land of Israel.

Your new moons and your appointed seasons My soul hateth…. And when you spread forth your hands … even when you make ever so many prayers</i> (ibid. 1:11–15). From these verses we can logically conclude that prayer is more important than all the sacrifices. Even though man may not deserve to have his prayers answered or to be treated mercifully, yet if he should pray and plead for mercy, I will be merciful toward him, as it is written: <i>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth</i> (Ps. 25:10).

In this verse he was called Abiel, but because he lit lamps in dark alleys for the public good he was also called Ner (“light”).

Two great men in the world were tested and found to be faithful before He raised them to positions of greatness. He tested David by means of a sheep. What did David do? He led the sheep into the desert to keep them from feeding from the field of others, and that is why his brother Eliab said to him: <i>With whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?</i> (I Sam. 17:28). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Thou hast been found trustworthy with regard to sheep, and so now I shall entrust My flock to you that you may shepherd them, as it is written: <i>Thou shalt shepherd My people Israel</i> (I Chron. 11:2).

Cain pursued Abel over hill and vale, until they began wrestling with one another. At first Abel overpowered Cain and threw him to the earth. When Cain realized that he was being defeated, he pleaded: “Abel, my brother, do not harm me.” Because he was a merciful person, Abel released him.

The third one said to him: “Help me, I implore your assistance.” “What is the trouble?” he inquired. “I have a ship three miles out at sea,” the philosopher replied, “and it is stranded, and all my possessions are in it.” Hadrian answered: “I will send my legions and my ships to rescue it.” Thereupon the philosopher declared: “Sire, why send your ships and legions? Send forth a blast of wind and save it.” “From whence should I have a blast of wind to send?” asked Hadrian.

Berechiah said: While they were still reflecting upon the matter, the Holy One, blessed be He, answered them, as it is said: <i>And they tried God in their hearts by asking for food for their craving</i> (Ps. 79:18). But the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: You have been asking, Is the Lord among us or not? Be assured, I will let you know. Hence, <i>Then came Amalek</i>.", 
        "2_Bereshit, 4_Siman, 13_Paragraph": "The angels of the Holy One, blessed be He, are mighty, but they are not His equal. Proof of the might of His angels is evidenced by the fact that one of them stretched forth his hand from heaven and grasped Ezekiel by a lock of his head, as it is said: <i>And the form of a hand was put forth, and I was taken by a lock of my head</i> (Ezek. 8:3). We learn from another verse that the distance from heaven to earth is no more than the palm of an angel, as it is written: <i>Then was the palm of the hand sent from before me, and this writing was inscribed</i> (Dan. 5:24). This teaches us that there is no limit to His ministering angels; how much more so, then, is there no limit to the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore it is written: <i>Great is the Lord and highly to be praised, and His greatness is unsearchable</i> (Ps. 145:3). And elsewhere it is said: <i>Yea, My hand hath laid the foundations of the earth, and My right hand hath spread out the heavens,</i> etc. (Isa. 48:13).", 
        "13_Vayechi, 2_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "Another explanation is that Jacob said: “Perhaps the Egyptians will be redeemed through me.” They are compared to asses, as it is said: <i>Whose flesh is the flesh of asses</i> (ibid. 33:20), and I am likened to a sheep, as is said: <i>Israel is a scattered sheep</i> (Jer. 50:17). And it is written elsewhere that <i>The firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep</i> (Exod. 34:20). Hence, (<i>Bury me not in Egypt</i>) lest the Egyptians be redeemed through me. Therefore <i>Bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt</i>.",

He gave us the Written Law (the Five Books of Moses), which contains hidden and obscure teachings, and explained them in the Oral Law (codified in the Mishnah), which was revealed to Israel alone. What is more, the Written Law enunciates only the general principles of the law, while the Oral Law discusses the specifics of the law. The Written Law is brief, while the Oral Law is lengthy, as it is written: <i>The measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea</i> (Job 11:9).", 
        "15_Vaera, 8_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "We know that Joash claimed divinity since it is written: <i>Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah and prostrated themselves before the king. Then the king harkened unto them</i> (II Chron. 24:17). What is the meaning of <i>prostrated themselves before the king</i>? They treated him like a god. They said to him: “If you were not a god, you would not have departed from the Holy of Holies (unharmed) after seven years.” He replied: “So shall it be.” And he agreed to proclaim himself a god. But whence do we know that he engaged in intercourse like a woman? It is written: <i>And it came to pass, when the year was come about, that the army of the Arameans came up against him; and they came to Judah and Jerusalem … so they executed judgment upon Joash</i> (ibid., vv. 23–24). This should not be read as <i>shefatim</i> (“judgment”) but rather as <i>shipputim</i> (“lust”). It is also written: <i>And when they departed from him—for they left him in great diseases—his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchers of the kings</i> (ibid., v. 25).",

Because of this verse they said: The man who hearkens to God’s word in time will hearken at other times as well, but if he ignores it at one time, he will do likewise at other times. Scripture teaches this in the verses <i>And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken</i> (Jer. 17:24), and <i>It shall be, too, if thou shalt forget</i> (Deut. 8:19). How is that? If a man desires to hear only that which is to his advantage, he will hear that which is not to his advantage as well; and if he wishes to forget when it is to his advantage to do so, he will forget even when it is not to his advantage to do so. The power to choose is given to man. <i>If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them, but unto the humble He giveth grace</i> (Prov. 3:34). If a man hearkens to one command, he will be caused to hearken to many; but if he desires to forget even one commandment, he will be caused to forget many. Therefore it is written: <i>If thou shalt begin to forget, thou wilt in time forget</i>. Others reach this conclusion from the verse <i>If thou at all take thy neighbor’s garment to pledge</i> (Exod. 22:25); that is, if you should seize one garment as a pledge, you will ultimately take many pledges because of it.",

Though many jars were filled and much meal was ground, yet <i>the jar of meal shall not be spent</i>, etc. Hence, <i>the blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and toil addeth nothing thereto</i> implies that she was blessed in her own home.",

Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Wicked ones, because you have introduced the use of the sword to subdue the poor and the needy, <i>their swords shall enter into their own hearts</i> (Ps. 37:15).

        "19_Mishpatim, 3_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "The ministering angels asked: Who is the one who caused the Shekhinah to depart from Israel? He replied: I have removed My Shekhinah from such-and-such place in which I have beheld a judge perverting justice, and I have forsaken that place, as is said: <i>For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety at whom they puff</i> (Ps. 12:6). What does the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He unsheathes His sword before the judge to remind him that there is a judge on high, as is said: <i>Be ye afraid of the sword; for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment</i> (Job 19:29). <i>Shadin</i> (“judgment, involvement”) is written here to indicate (by its similarity to Shaddai [Almighty]) that when a judge judges truthfully, the Shekhinah does not depart form that place, as it is said: <i>When the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was moved to judge, and save them out of the hands of their enemies, all the days of the judge</i> (Judg. 2:18).

In the second stage he is like a swine that grovels in dunghills, for a child waddles in the dirt when he is two years old. In the third stage he is like a kid who skips about in the pasture. He is a delight in the eyes of his mother and a joy to his father. He skips about here and there, while laughing, and everyone takes delight in him. In the fourth stage he acts like a horse about to run in a race. When is that? At the time of maturity, when he is eighteen years old. Just as the horse prances about and preens himself, so the youth preens himself before his companions. In the fifth stage he is like an ass upon which a saddle has been placed. Men place a saddle upon him by giving him a wife who bears him sons and daughters. He roams hither and yon to obtain food and sustenance for his children. They pile additional burdens upon him, and he is overwhelmed with problems because of his sons and daughters. When is that? When he is forty years old. In the sixth stage he is like a dog, who intrudes here and there, and takes from one and gives to another and is not embarrassed. In the seventh stage he resembles a monkey, who is different from all other creatures. He asks about everything, he eats and drinks like a youngster and laughs like a child. He returns to his childish ways in discernment but not in other things. Even his children and the men of his household mock him, curse him, and hate him. When he offers an opinion they say: “Ignore him, for he is an old fool.” He behaves like an ape in all situations and in whatever he says.

Observe that when they were immersed in lewdness, it is written in Scripture: <i>The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives, whomsoever they chose</i> (Gen. 6:1), and after that it is said: <i>And it repented the Lord that He had made man on the earth … and He said: I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the earth</i> (ibid. 6:6–7). Likewise in reference to the Sodomites, it is said: <i>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, compassed the house around … and they called unto Lot … For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before the Lord; the Lord hath sent us to destroy it</i> (Gen. 19:4, 13).

After all, the king does not know who was rebellious and who was loyal. The Holy One, blessed be He, however, does not behave in that fashion. Though an entire generation should anger Him, He will save a single righteous man among them. Therefore, it is written: <i>A righteous man regardeth the life of his beasts</i> (ibid.).

This verse refers to Isaac and Jacob, for both of them desired to disclose the secrets of the Holy One, blessed be He. Concerning Isaac it is written: <i>And he called Esau, his eldest son</i> (Gen. 27:1), to reveal to him what was to transpire in the Messianic age. That was the reason the Holy One, blessed be He, withdrew the knowledge of it from him. Jacob likewise wanted to reveal to his sons what would occur in the Messianic age, as it is said: <i>He called unto his sons and said: “Gather yourselves together that I may tell you”</i> (ibid. 49:1).",

Whereupon the two of them went to the elders, as it is said: <i>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel</i> (Exod. 4:39). The elders are always held responsible for the survival of Israel. That is why Scripture says: <i>And all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, stood on this side of the ark and on that side</i> (Josh. 8:33). When do (the people of) Israel survive? When they have elders among them. Thus, when the Temple was erected, they consulted the elders, as is said: <i>Ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, thine elders, and they will tell thee</i> (Deut. 32:7). Any one who consults his elders will not blunder. This is confirmed in the episode wherein Ben-hadad sent messengers to the king of Israel. “<i>Thus saith Ben-hadad: Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also, and thy children, even the goodliest are mine.” The king of Israel answered and said: “It is according to thy saying, my lord, O king; I am thine, and all that I have”</i> (I Kings 20:3). Later He sent another messenger to him saying: <i>But I will send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time, and thy shall search thy house, and the houses of thy servants, and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand and take it away</i> (I Kings 20:6). Does this verse imply that the things he (Ben-hadad) demanded at first were not desirable? He had asked for silver and gold, and surely they are desirable, as it is said: <i>And the choicest things of all nations shall come</i> (Hag. 2:7). He had demanded women, and that, indeed, is good to possess, as it is said: <i>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes in a plague</i> (Ezek. 24:16).<sup>34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ezekiel’s wife was taken from him.</i> He desired their children, and they surely are precious, as is said: <i>Yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb</i> (Hos. 9:6). The fact is that everything he wanted was desirable. What, then, is meant by <i>And it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes</i>? It refers to that which is most pleasant, the Torah, as it is said: <i>More to be desired are they then gold, yea, then much fine gold</i> (Ps. 19:11).",

Scripture also says elsewhere in reference to this: <i>Who hath wrought and done it? He that called the generations from the beginning</i> (Isa. 14:4). The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: When I determined at the very beginning of time to build the Sanctuary, I already announced his name, and made his name known. <i>And it is foreknown what man is</i>. Even when the first man was a lifeless mass, the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him all the righteous men who would descend from him. Some hung from his head, others were suspended from his hair, and still others from his neck, his two eyes, his nose, his mouth, his ears, and his arms. Proof of this is in the fact that when Job complained against his Creator, saying: <i>O that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even unto His seat! I would order my cause before Him, and fill my mouth with arguments. I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would say unto me</i> (Job 23:3–5). The Holy One, blessed be He, replied to him: <i>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?</i> (ibid. 38:4). R.

But Nabal retorted: <i>Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master; shall I then take my bread and my water and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers and give it unto men of whom I know not whence they are?</i> (ibid., vv. 10–11). When David’s men returned and repeated Nabal’s words, he armed himself and his soldiers, and with their weapons started out to destroy Nabal. <i>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying: “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; but he hath spoken rudely to them”</i> (ibid., v. 14). As soon as she heard what had transpired, she prepared a gift which she took to David, as it is said: <i>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of corn … and she said unto her men: “Go on before me; I come after you.” But she told not her husband Nabal</i> (ibid., vv. 18–19). Later on Scripture states: <i>And it came to pass about ten days later, that the Lord smote Nabal so that he died…. and David sent and spoke unto Abigail to take her to him to wife</i> (ibid. 38:39). After he had her brought to him, David stayed apart from her for three months to determine whether or not she had conceived with Nabal. After the third month, David had intercourse with her and she became pregnant. The scoffers in that generation asserted that she had actually conceived from Nabal. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He ordered the angel in charge of the formation of embryos to fashion that embryo in the likeness of its father so that everyone would be forced to acknowledge that David was the father. We know that this is so from the verse <i>And his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and his second, Chileab, of Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite</i> (II Sam. 3:2). Why does Scripture call him Chileab (<i>khilav</i>)? Because he was completely like his father (<i>kulo av</i>), and everyone who saw him said: “David is this child’s father.”",

Would You judge the innocent as You judge the wicked? Would You destroy the innocent and the evil together? <i>It is far from Thee to do after this manner</i> (Gen. 18:25). Since the Hebrew word <i>hallilah</i> (“it is far from thee”) contains the letters of the word <i>hallalah</i> (“profaned”), as in the verse <i>A woman that is a harlot, or profaned</i> (Lev. 21:7), this verse implies that he was suggesting, “Would it not be a profanation of Your name if You were to act in this manner?

Observe what is written in the verse <i>Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him; but the righteous shall live by his faith</i> (Hab. 2:4). <i>Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright in him</i> refers to Nebuchadnezzar. How do we know this? The Holy One, blessed be He, made him ruler of the entire world, yet he did not rejoice in his lot, as it is said: <i>His soul is not upright in him</i>. When he looked at himself he became embarrassed in the presence of his fellow men. He would say: “I am king,” yet <i>his soul was not upright in him</i>. Why was that? Because he was squat in stature, like a <i>kad</i> (“jug”). That is why he was called Nebukadnezzar.", 
        "12_Vayigash, 8_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "<i>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite</i> (ibid. 38:2). She bore him two sons, Er and Onan, and both of them died. During the years in which Joseph was separated from his father, Jacob was convinced that Judah had killed him. Whence do you learn this? From the episode dealing with Benjamin: <i>Whereas Judah said to Joseph: “For thy servant is surety for the youth”</i> (ibid. 44:32). It was only after he announced that he had pledged himself for Benjamin that Joseph disclosed his identity and Judah was exonerated from guilt in this matter. Therefore <i>And the envy of Ephraim was turned</i> (Isa. 11:13). Hence, Scripture states: <i>And he sent Judah before him</i>.",

Simeon the son of Gamliel said: Observe how dearly the Holy One, blessed be He, loved Israel that he altered, for their sake, the natural order of things. The Holy One, blessed be He, made the heavenly spheres become like the lower spheres, and the lower spheres to become like the upper spheres, for their sake. Previously, bread came from the earth and water descended from heaven, but now He caused bread to descend from the heavens and water to come out of the earth, as it is said: <i>Behold, I will cause to rain bread for you, and when the layer of dew was gone up</i> (Exod. 16:14).",

If he had been a great and powerful priest of Midian, would they have dared drive them away? This teaches us that they oppressed him and drove his daughters away just as a divorced woman is driven away, as Scripture states: <i>So he drove out the man</i> (Gen. 3:24). <i>But Moses stood up and saved them</i> (Exod. 3:17). You learn from this that the shepherds were about to attack them, as is stated in the verse: <i>The betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her</i> (Deut. 22:27). <i>And when they came to Reuel, their father … they said: “An Egyptian saved us”</i> (Exod. 2:18).",

And Aaron took as Moses spoke and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague was begun among the people</i> (Num. 17:11–12). What is meant by <i>the plague was begun</i>? R. Judah the son of Simon stated: The angel administered the poison in sequence, neglecting neither the dead among the living nor the living among the dead. That is, he administered it in rotation. As it is said in the verse: <i>The plague was begun among the people</i>, and it is written elsewhere in the verse: <i>From the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn thou shalt begin</i> (Deut. 16:9).",

Antoninus asked our saintly Rabbi: “What if a man should pray every hour?” He replied: “That is forbidden.” “Why?” he queried. “So as not to act irreverently towards the Mighty One,” he responded. But Antoninus, however, would not accept this answer. What did our saintly Rabbi do? He arose early (the next day) and went to him and said: “O master, O ruler.” An hour later he visited him again, and said: “O emperor.” After another hour had passed, he called out: “Greetings, O king.” The king said to him: “Why do you ridicule the emperor?” And he replied: “Let your ears hear what your lips are saying. You are a mere mortal, and yet you say that the man who greets you every hour mocks you; how much more so, then, should the King of Kings, who is not a mere man, not be annoyed every hour.”", 
        "14_Shemot, 0_Siman, 4_Paragraph": "Another example of this is stated in Scripture: <i>Now Isaac loved Esau</i> (ibid. 25:28). Apparently, Esau went astray because his father failed to chastise him. As we have learned, the wicked Esau committed five transgressions in one day: he slept with a betrothed maiden, killed a man, denied the concept of resurrection, rejected the essential principle of religion (i.e., became an atheist), and despised the birthright. All of these transgressions are indicated either specifically in verses in Scripture or by analogy with other verses in Scripture (<i>gezerah shavah</i>). Furthermore, he longed for his father’s death, so that he might slay his brother, as it is said: <i>Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand, then will I slay my brother, Jacob</i> (Gen. 27:41). He compelled Jacob to flee from his father’s house, while he went to Ishmael’s home to learn evil ways from him, and to add to the number of his wives, as it is said: <i>So Esau went unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives that he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son</i> (ibid. 28:9).",

Achan was burned to death when he violated the ban by taking things from Jericho and hiding them in his tents. These (things) were the cloaks and the golden tongues from inside the mouths of the idols at Jericho, upon which an unclean (i.e., idolatrous) name had been engraved. Because he violated the pact of excommunication, thirty-six Israelites perished,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The members of Achan’s family. See B. Sanhedrin 44a.</i> and Joshua rent his clothes and prostrated himself upon the ground before the ark. <i>And the Lord said unto Joshua: “Get thee up; wherefore, now, art thou fallen upon thy face? Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen</i>, etc. (Josh. 7:10). Why is the word <i>gam</i> (variously translated “yea” and “also” in the preceding passage) repeated five times in this verse? To teach us that whosoever violates a vow of excommunication is considered to be transgressing against the Five Books of Moses. For all other sins, the guilty one is punished, but for the violation of an oath of excommunication the transgressor and all mankind are punished, as it is said: <i>Therefore doth the land mourn, and everyone that dwelleth therein doth languish</i> (Hos. 4:3), and elsewhere it states: <i>Therefore, hath a curse devoured the land, and they that dwell therein are found guilty</i> (Isa. 24:6). Similarly, you find that it is said about Achan: <i>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass against the banned things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And that man perished not alone in his iniquity</i> (Josh. 22:20).", 
        "17_Beshalach, 11_Siman, 12_Paragraph": "Nebuchadnezzar was also punished with the thing of which he boasted, for it is said: <i>And thou saidst in thy heart: “I will ascend into heaven, above the stars of God will I exalt my throne; and I will sit upon the mount of meeting, in the uttermost parts of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds”</i> (Isa. 14:13–15), but after that is written: <i>Yet thou shalt be brought down to the netherworld, to the uttermost parts of the pit</i>.", 
        "2_Bereshit, 12_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "R. Simeon the son of Yohai said to his son: “These are worthy men, go to them that they may bless you.” He visited them and found them comparing two texts. It is written: <i>Make plain the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established</i> (Prov. 4:26), and it is written as well: <i>Lest she should walk the even path of life, her ways wander but she knoweth it not</i> (Prov. 5:6).

You find that when Elijah said to Elisha: <i>Ask what I shall do for thee before I am taken from thee</i> (II Kings 2:9), Elisha replied: <i>Let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me</i>. Thereupon Elijah responded: <i>Thou hast asked a difficult thing; nevertheless, if thou shouldst see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. And it came to pass, as they still went on and talked, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and hordes of fire, which parted them both asunder</i> (ibid., vv. 10–11). Surely it was Elisha’s duty to visit his father and mother first in order to revive them, but instead he revived the son of his host, the Shunammite’s son. Similarly Elijah should have revived his father, instead of reviving the son of (the widow of) Zarephath, but he risked his life in appreciation for her hospitality.",

(This tells us no.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The embryo was conceived before the sale was made.</i>) <i>The males shall be the Lord’s</i> (Exod. 13:12). R.

Nehemiah was of the opinion that it means freedom from the angel of death. While the sages contended that it means freedom from suffering. R. Eliezer the son of R. Yosé the Galilean stated: If the angel of death should come to the Holy One, blessed be He, and say: “You created me for naught in this world,” the Holy One, blessed be he would answer him: I have given you dominion over all the nations of the world except this one, to which I have granted freedom (<i>herut</i>) because of the tablets.

R. Johanan posed the query: From what source do we learn the penalty for debasing the reputation of a person? He explained: From the fact that Scripture states: <i>And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he has brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel</i> (Deut. 22:19). Similarly, we brought an evil name (upon God) when we said of the golden calf: <i>This is thy God, O Israel</i>; therefore let each Israelite give a silver piece.",

However, the world is hardly able to tolerate the sun. Why? Because its light is so intense. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Though you are unable to endure the light that I created, I desire a light nevertheless. Why did they prepare the olive oil?

Haman’s riches were also harmful to him, for though it is said: <i>And Haman recounted unto them the glory of his riches</i> (Est. 5:11), ultimately: <i>So they hanged Haman</i> (ibid. 7:10).

The king became enraged and cried out: “I ought to kill her.” Her best friend heard this and said to the king: “My lord king, if she lost the pearls, remember that her father entrusted her pearls to you for safekeeping.

At first they had no sons, but after these righteous men entered their homes and then departed, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them sons. These two were Laban and Jethro. If Laban had any sons of his own, would his daughters have been forced to shepherd his flock? The fact is that he had no sons, but after Jacob’s arrival, he was blessed with property and sons, as it is written: <i>And the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake</i> (Gen. 30:27), and furthermore, it is written: <i>And he heard the words of Laban’s sons</i> (ibid. 31:1). In this instance, it is written: <i>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters</i> (Exod. 2:16). Is it likely that if he had sons his daughters would have been shepherdesses? No. Obviously, he had no sons. After Moses entered his house, however, he was blessed with sons, as it is written: <i>And the sons of the Kenite, Moses’s father-in law</i> (Judg. 14:17).",

Now Hezron was in fact the grandson of Judah, as it is said: <i>And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul</i> (Gen. 46:12), and it is also written: <i>And after that Hezron was dead in Caleb-ephrath, then Abiah Hezron’s wife bore him Ashhur</i> (I Chron. 2:24). Can a man die within another man that it should say: <i>And after that Hezron died in Caleb</i>? This must mean that after Hezron died Caleb came to Ephrath, who was in fact Miriam, through whom Israel increased and multiplied, as it is written: <i>And Azubah died, and Caleb took unto him Ephrath, who bore him Hur.

They asked him: “What are these cedars for?” “The Holy One, blessed be He, intends to bring a flood upon the earth, and He has ordered me to build an ark so that I and my family might escape,” he replied. They laughed at him and ridiculed his words. Nevertheless, he tended the trees till they grew large. Once again they asked him: “What are you doing?” He repeated what he had told them previously, but they continued to mock him. After some time, he cut down the trees and sawed them into lumber. Again they inquired: “What are you doing?” He warned them once again as to what would happen, but they still refused to repent.

Abraham began to ponder the matter, but did not know which to choose. R. Hanina the son of Pappa held that Abraham chose the rule of foreign kingdoms and said: It is better that my descendants shall be enslaved in exile than that any one of them should descend into Gehinnom. The Holy One, blessed be He, agreed with him, as is said: <i>Except their rock had given them over, and the Lord had delivered them up</i> (Deut. 32:30). <i>Except their rock had given them over</i> refers to Abraham, as is written: <i>Look unto the rock whence ye were hewn</i> (Isa. 51:1).

Hananiah the son of Azzur, the false prophet, had prophesied good tidings, as it is said: <i>And they have healed the hurt of the daughters of my people lightly, saying peace when there is no peace</i> (ibid. 8:11), and he had told them also: <i>Behold, the vessels of the house of the Lord shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon</i> (ibid. 27:16). Thereupon Jeremiah exclaimed: I prophesy evil in accordance with the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, while you prophesy good tidings falsely of your own accord. <i>Yet may it be that the Lord fulfill the words which thou hast prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the Lord’s house</i> (ibid. 28:6).",

Isaac was born on the first day of Nisan. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Himself: I will combine the celebrations. The scoffers in that generation grumbled and complained, saying: “The work of the Tabernacle has already been completed and it still has not been set up.” They were not aware of the plan and the intention of the Holy One, blessed be He.

Similarly, <i>And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters</i> (ibid. 5:6). Hence he was the first to be punished.

Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, commence the account of the creation of His world with the letter <i>bet</i> rather than with the <i>alef,</i> the first letter of the alphabet? He did so because the <i>alef</i> is the first letter of the word <i>arur</i> (“cursed”), while the <i>bet</i> is the first letter of the word <i>barukh</i> (“blessed”). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: “I will begin the account of the creation of the world with the letter that symbolizes a blessing.” Even though the account of the creation of the world starts with a letter that symbolizes a blessing, mankind angered its Creator.

From Hannah, as it is said: <i>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart</i> (I Sam. 1:13). You may know this also from Rachel and Leah. At first Leah was not considered worthy of marrying anyone but Esau, while Rachel was destined to wed Jacob. Leah would sit at the crossroads inquiring about Esau’s actions, and they would tell her: “Oh, he is a wicked man; he sheds blood and waylays passers-by, he is covered with red hair as a garment and commits every kind of abomination against God.” Upon hearing all of this, she would cry bitterly: “My sister Rachel and I were born of the same womb, yet Rachel is to marry the righteous man and I the wicked Esau.” She wept and fasted until her sight became weak. Hence it is written: <i>And Leah’s eyes were weak</i> (Gen. 29:17). <i>And the Lord saw that Leah was hated</i> (ibid., v. 31). This verse indicates that Esau’s actions were hateful to her. However, when Rachel learned that she was to marry Jacob she was elated and became arrogant. Once they both were married to Jacob, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: She cried, and fasted, and despised Esau’s behavior, and prayed to me. It would be unjust to keep her from the righteous one.

And thus it is said: <i>O Lord my God, Thou art very great</i> (ibid., v. 1). Another comment on <i>O Lord my God, Thou are very great: Thou art very great</i> refers to the wondrous deeds You performed for man when you gave him old age and a hoary head. If this had not been done, men would not know whom to honor. The word <i>very</i> alludes only to old age, as it is said: <i>Eli was very old</i> (I Sam. 2:22). <i>Thou art clothed with glory and majesty</i> (Ps. 104:1). <i>Glory</i> signifies the strength with which I clothed you at the sea, as is said: <i>The Lord is my strength and my song</i> (Exod. 15:2). R. Judah the son of Ilai said: He praised Me and I praised him (Israel). <i>Majesty</i> alludes to the majesty with which you were adorned through Me at Sinai above all the nations of the world. R. Judah the son of Simon stated: Because they declared: <i>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do and hear</i> (Exod. 24:7), Scripture speaks of them at that moment <i>As a lily between the thorns</i> (Song 2:22).

He wrote: “Peace to Hezekiah the king, peace to Jerusalem, and peace to the great God.” As the scribes were about to depart, he became uneasy. He said to himself: “Did I not do wrong in mentioning the peace of Hezekiah and of the city before addressing the great God?” He arose from his throne, took three steps to recall the scribes, and wrote another letter to replace it.

Daniel said to Arioch: “<i>Wherefore is the decree so peremptory from the king?” Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel</i> (ibid., v. 16). Then Arioch immediately brought Daniel before the king and said unto him: <i>I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation</i> (ibid., v. 25). The king asked: “Are you Daniel?” He did not say this because he failed to recognize him, but in order to inquire of him: <i>Are you able to tell me the dream and its interpretation?</i> (ibid., v. 26).

Why should an old man, who begets a son at the age of a hundred, destroy him? Have you not heard the parable of the man who destroyed his own possessions and then was forced to beg from others? If you believe that you will have another son, you are listening to the words of a seducer.

Why is the word for “fear” repeated in this verse? He <i>was greatly afraid</i> that he might be killed and <i>distressed</i> lest he should be forced to kill. Jacob was an extremely powerful man. Proof of this is that he had subdued a mighty angel, as is said: <i>So he strove with an angel and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him</i> (Hos. 12:5). But at that moment he began to plead for mercy, as it is said: <i>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau</i> (Gen. 32:12).",

R. Abba maintained: <i>In a time when Thou mayest be found</i> refers to old age. It is essential that a man pray for an old age in which his eyes may see, his mouth may eat, and his feet may walk. Normally, when a man becomes old, his faculties leave him. For example, it is written about Isaac: <i>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see</i> (Gen. 27:1). And concerning Jacob, Scripture states: <i>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see</i> (Gen. 48:10). As to a mouth that could not eat, we find that Barzillai said to David: <i>Can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear anymore the voice of singing men and singing women? Therefore, then, should thy servant be a burden unto my lord the king?</i> (II Sam. 19:35).",

He explained further: This verse teaches us that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Jacob, our father, the guardian angel of Babylon ascending seventy rungs of the ladder and descending, the guardian angel of Media ascending fifty-two rungs of the ladder and descending, the guardian angel of Greece ascending one hundred rungs of the ladder and descending, and the guardian angel of Edom ascending the ladder.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ascent and descent of the guardian angels foretold the rise and fall of the nations they represented. Note that the text does not depict the guardian angel of Edom, i.e., Rome, as descending.</i> Jacob did not know how many rungs of the ladder the guardian angel of Edom mounted, and he therefore cried out in terror: Perhaps Edom will never be compelled to descend. The Holy One, blessed be He, then said to him: <i>Fear thou not, O Jacob, My servant; neither be dismayed, O Israel</i> (Jer. 30:10), for even though you see him ascending unto My throne as though that were possible, I will cast him down, as is said: <i>Though thou wert to rise as high as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the Lord</i> (Obad. 4).",

Why was this crown of glory bestowed upon Abraham? Because he performed acts of charity. Therefore, it is written: <i>And Abraham was old</i>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: It is sufficient for a servant to be like his master. This may be compared to a king who has a dear friend, to whom he says: “What present can I give You? You have silver, gold, male servants, handmaidens, fields, and vineyards. I will give you the crown that is on my head, and place it upon your head.” Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham: Silver and gold I have given thee, as it is said: <i>And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold</i> (Gen. 13:1); now what can I give you beside the crown that is on My head?

There is no way of knowing which event frightened him more, but since the word <i>exceedingly</i> is mentioned in this verse, you may presume that this was the more terrifying experience. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: Because of the evil inclination, you do not pursue My ways in this world, but in the future I will place within you a new heart; <i>And I will put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh</i> (Ezek. 11:19).",

A bystander asked the priest: “Why is it that when he gave you the tithe and the priestly portion, you did not thank him, but when he added only a single measure of unconsecrated food, you thanked him?” The priest replied: “The tithe and the priestly offering belong to me, and I merely accepted that which belonged to me, but the measure of unconsecrated food he added belonged to him, and so I thanked him for it.” Similarly Leah said: “Twelve tribes are to descend from Jacob, and since he has four wives, each of us is entitled to bear three sons. I have already given birth to three sons, my rightful share, but now a fourth son has been granted to me; surely it is fitting that <i>I praise the Lord</i> this time.” Therefore <i>Rachel envied her sister</i> (Gen. 30:1).

However, if you should ask: Why did He create the evil inclination, concerning which it is written: <i>The inclination of man’s heart is evil from his youth</i> (Gen. 8:21)?, you say thereby: Since man is evil, who can make him good? The Holy One, blessed be He, contends: You make him evil!

When Jeroboam brought offerings to the idols, his hand did not dry up, but when he stretched forth his hand against the prophet, it did dry up. From this fact, you learn that the Holy One, blessed be He, was more concerned about the honor of that righteous man than about His own honor.

When Abraham descended the Egyptians approached him, <i>and the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair</i> (ibid. 12:14), and concerning his descendants, the Egyptians declared: <i>Come, let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that when there befalleth us any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land</i> (Exod. 1:10).",

Because Moses was distressed, the Holy One, blessed be He, concealed the way to erect it from them, and that is why they were unable to do so. After they had tried in every way to do so and still were unable to set it up, all the Israelites approached Moses saying: “Moses, our master, everything you told us we have done, and everything you asked us to bring and to give, we have given: <i>Behold, all the work of the Tabernacle</i> (Exod. 39:32).

After all, if the Holy One, blessed be He, is righteous, is it likely that He would hasten the evil and bring it upon us? This verse implies that the Holy One, blessed be He, performed a kindness for Israel by causing the exile of Jehoiachin to precede that of Zedekiah so that the Oral Law might not be forgotten by the Israelites. They resided in Babylon, with their Torah, from that day unto this, and neither Rome nor Greece has ruled them or forced them to convert.

Israel crossed the Red Sea, and the idol Micah (had made) was carried with them when, as it is said: <i>And over the tree affliction shall pass</i> (Zech. 10:11). Nevertheless the sea split asunder for them. Therefore, <i>Unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of face</i>.",

The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: Since I reveal Myself to anyone who brings a burnt offering or a peace offering in order to bless him, how much more so would I reveal Myself to Abraham, who sacrificed himself for Me. Hence, it is said: <i>And the Lord appeared unto Him.</i> R. Aha said: I will prove to you that the Holy One, blessed be He, strengthened Abraham. On the very day he circumcised himself, and while his blood was still flowing, he circumcised Ishmael and all the men of his household. How many men were born in his home? Three hundred and eighteen. (Now if that many were born in his home) how many others must he have purchased, and yet it is written: <i>And Abraham took Ishmael and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with money</i> (Gen. 17:23), and: <i>In that selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son, and all the men of his house born in the house, and bought with money,</i> etc. (ibid., vv. 26–27).

Later he returned to his uncle, Hadrian, who asked him: “Why has your countenance changed? I am inclined to think that your business was unsuccessful or that some person oppressed you.” (He answered) “That is not so. You are my relative, and no man would dare oppress me.” Hadrian continued asking him: “But why has your countenance changed?” “I have studied the Torah,” he replied, “and I was also circumcised.” “Who advised you to do that?” he asked. “You did,” he answered. “When did I do that?” “When I told you I desired to engage in business, you said: ‘Whatever merchandise you find low, that is worthless, and lying on the ground because it is ignored, do business in it, for it will finally rise in value.’ I have traveled among the nations and have found nothing so low and so cast down as Israel, and it is destined to rise, as Isaiah said: <i>Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, His Holy One, to him who is despised of men, to him who is abhorred of nations, to a servant of rulers: “Kings shall see and arise; princes, and they shall prostrate themselves; because of the Lord that is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee”</i> (Isa. 40:9).

We know that the Holy One, blessed be He, is able to save us, but whether we are saved or not, we shall not prostrate ourselves before your image, for it is written: <i>If our God whom we serve is able to deliver us, He will deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and out of thy hand, O king.

Then Nebuchadnezzar replied: <i>Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you serve not my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</i> (ibid., v. 14). What is the meaning of <i>Is it true?</i> It means that he said to them: “Is it true what you say?” <i>Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king: “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this manner</i>” (ibid., v. 16). They did not address him as king but simply as Nebuchadnezzar. “We have no need to obey you in this demand. If you had issued a decree concerning taxes or levies upon our crops or upon anything else, we would say, ‘I keep the king’s command,’ and you would be obeyed as a king, but when you command us to deny our God, then you are merely Nebuchadnezzar. We have no need to respond to you in any demand, for we have been commanded in regard to the oath of God: <i>Be not hasty to go out of his presence, stand not in an evil thing</i> (Eccles. 8:3).” Upon hearing this, <i>Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the form of his visage was changed, against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated….

When the Holy One, blessed be He, created His world, the entire world was composed of water, as it is said: <i>And darkness was upon the face of the deep</i> (Gen. 1:2). R. Judah and R. Nehemiah discussed this verse. R. Judah said: The Holy One, blessed be He, created the darkness first, and then He created the world. R. Nehemiah contended that the Holy One, blessed be He, created the world first and then the darkness. R. Simeon the son of Yehozadak inquired of R. Samuel about this. He said to him: You are an authority on aggadic traditions, so tell me, how did the Holy One, blessed be He, create His world? When He created the world, did He create the light first? R. Samuel the son of Nahman answered: When He decided to create His world, He surrounded Himself with light, and then He created the world, as is said: <i>Who coverest Thyself with light as a garment</i>, and that is followed by: <i>Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain</i> (Ps. 104:2).

        "10_Vayeshev, 2_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "There are creatures that thrive in the air but do not thrive in fire, and conversely there are creatures that thrive in fire but do not thrive in the air. If one that lives in the air enters a fire, he cannot survive, and if one that lives in fire ascends into the air, he cannot survive. Yet Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were hurled into the fire and went forth unscathed, as it is said: <i>Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth</i> (Dan. 3:26). The creature that thrives in fire but does not thrive in the air is the salamander. How do we know this? When glass blowers are about to fashion glass objects, they stoke their furnace for seven days and seven nights. When the fire becomes extremely hot, a creature similar to a lizard that is called a salamander comes out. If a man should smear his hand or any part of his body with its blood, fire will not affect that place, for the animal is created in fire. From this fact our sages taught that the fire of Gehenna does not affect the scholar, (deriving this) <i>a fortiori</i> from a salamander. For if the blood of a salamander, which is merely created in fire, can make a man’s body immune to fire, how much more so would the scholar, who observes the law, which is a fiery law, given by One who is a consuming fire, and of whose teacher (is said): <i>The house of Jacob shall be a fire</i> (Obad. 18), be immune from the fire of Gehenna.

Even the patriarchs temporized and flattered the one in power at the moment. Abraham relied upon Sarah: <i>That it be well with me for thy sake</i> (Gen. 12:13).

This entire psalm alludes to the nations. For at the conclusion of this psalm, it is written: <i>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Do homage in purity,</i> etc. (ibid., vv. 11–12). David said to them: Take heed, lest you deviate from the right path, <i>and He be angry, and ye perish in the way</i> (Ps. 2:12), for He might become angry with you, even over a trivial matter. In reference to Israel, however, it is written: <i>Serve the Lord with gladness; come before His presence with thanksgiving</i> (Ps. 100:2). This psalm was undoubtedly said with reference to Israel, for David composed it in thanksgiving, as it is written: <i>A psalm of thanksgiving</i> (ibid., v. 1).",

Because the wicked one boasted that since he was a god, he had no need to go to the water to relieve himself. Therefore he went out early in the morning so that no one would see him performing a demeaning act. That is why the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: <i>Rise up early in the morning</i>, when he must (go out), <i>and say unto him: Thus saith the Lord, the God of the Hebrews … for I will this time send all My plagues upon thy person</i>, etc. (Exod. 9:14). Ordinarily, when a man desires to harm his enemy, he does so unexpectedly lest he be forewarned, but the Holy One, blessed be He, warned the wicked Pharaoh before each plague, as it is said: <i>Behold, I will cause it to rain</i> (ibid., v. 18), <i>Behold, tomorrow will I bring locusts into thy border</i> (ibid. 10:5).

And it is also written elsewhere: <i>And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac</i> (ibid. 25:19). This teaches us that he resembled his father in every respect; in beauty, wisdom, strength, riches, and (the performance of) good deeds. You know this to be so from the fact that though Isaac, at the time of the sacrifice, was thirty-seven years of age, and Abraham was an old man, yet he bound him and tied him as though he were a sheep, and Isaac did not resist. Scripture states: <i>And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac, but unto the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts</i> (ibid., v. 5); that is to say, he distanced them from Isaac (so that he would have undisputed possession of the land).

From this verse we learn that the paschal lamb may be eaten in two places. How am I to interpret the phrase <i>In one house</i>? It may be interpreted to mean (that it may be eaten) by one group of people. How does it happen then that one may eat the paschal lamb in two places? For example, if men are seated inside a house when a beam splits above their heads, they are compelled to go outside to eat it, and if they are outside when it commences to rain, they are forced to go inside. Hence they may eat it in two places. If this (is so), what is meant by <i>Thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house</i> (ibid., v. 46)? This means you may not carry it out from the group. <i>Thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh</i> refers to the meat on the outside of the bone and not to that which is within the bone (i.e., the marrow). <i>Neither shall ye break a bone thereof</i> (ibid.) indicates that you shall not break the bone of the paschal sacrifice, but that (does not apply) to the bones of any other sacrifices of less sanctity. It is not a transgression of the commandment: Neither shall you break a bone <i>thereof. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it</i> (ibid., v. 47). Why is this said? Since Scripture states: <i>Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families</i> (Exod. 12:21), (you might think that the paschal lamb can be brought [to the Temple] only by a family group. Nevertheless) this verse informs us that the Passover offering of subsequent generations may be brought by mixed groups.",

Joseph was sold because of a dream, as is said: <i>Behold the dreamer cometh … come, let us go and sell him to the Ishmaelites</i> (Gen. 37:27), and he governed because of a dream, as is said: <i>And it came to pass at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed</i> (Gen. 41:1).",

Conversely, one who reads the Torah is forbidden to turn away from the scroll as he reads, for the Torah was given only in writing, as it is said: <i>And I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables</i> (Exod. 34:1). That is why anyone who is translating the Torah in public is forbidden to look into the Torah scroll while doing so. R. Judah the son of Pazzi declared: There is an entire verse in Scripture that deals with this subject: <i>Write thou these words, for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</i> (ibid., v. 27). <i>Write thou these words</i> alludes to the Pentateuch, which was given in writing, while <i>The tenor of these words</i> refers to the translation of the Torah that was given orally.",

This verse refers to the generation of Joash. Our sages teach us: One should not enter the Sanctuary with an offering while wearing a bordered cloak, a money belt, or felt shoes, for the people may say of him: “If he becomes wealthy, he acquired his wealth from the Temple treasury.” Just as a man must be morally pure in the sight of heaven, so must he be above suspicion among his fellowmen, as it is said: <i>Then ye shall be clean before the Lord, and before Israel</i> (Num. 3:22). Yet Moses alone was in charge of the Tabernacle treasury. At the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them</i> (Exod. 25:8), it is written: <i>And Moses assembled all the congregation and said: “Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord”</i> (Exod. 35:1, 5).",

After Sarah’s death, he first betrothed Isaac and then took a wife for himself. Where do we learn this? It is written: <i>Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent</i>, and after: <i>Abraham took another wife</i>. Isaac said to himself: “I have taken a wife, but my father is without a wife.” What did Isaac do? He went and bought him (Abraham) a wife. Rabbi said: Hagar and Keturah were one and the same person.

Whereupon he summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them: “During the years in which you dwelt in your land, wild beasts never devoured you; why is this happening now?” They whispered to each other: “Let us all give the same answer and perhaps he will permit us to return.” They told him: “That land welcomes no one who does not occupy himself with the Torah and is uncircumcised.” “Then select two men from among you,” he replied, “to go there and instruct them.” Since a king’s command may not be rescinded, they sent R. Dostai the son of Yannai and R. Sabaya there. They taught them the written Torah in abbreviated form.",

Apparently You are not able to foreclose Your affection for them. <i>Now, if I have found grace in Thy sight, show me Thy ways</i> (ibid., v. 13).", 
        "19_Mishpatim, 17_Siman, 5_Paragraph": "Another explanation of <i>He will not pardon your transgressions</i>. Why not? For he is only a messenger, and a messenger can only do what he is sent to do. I alone can lift up countenances (i.e., grant pardon), as it is said: <i>The Lord lift up His countenance unto thee</i> (Num. 6:26). David cried out: Master of the Universe, you trust us into the keeping of an angel who cannot pardon us, but if<i> Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who can stand?</i> (Ps. 130:3). If You should say: Forgiveness is not available to you, <i>For with Thee there is forgiveness that Thou mayest be feared</i> (ibid., 4), therefore do not place over us the angel who is guardian of the Inner Sanctum, since it is said: For he will not pardon your transgressions. Why? <i>For it is said My name is in him</i> (Exod. 23:21) (i.e., he is only my messenger). R. Simeon the son of Lakish said: The name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is coupled with every angel, as it is said: <i>For My name is in him</i>.", 
        "22_Ki Tisa, 19_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "There was no one superior to Hur, who was killed at that time. Moses became angry because the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke harshly to him. The word <i>daber</i> (“spoke”) signifies harsh speech, as it is said: <i>The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us</i> (Gen. 42:30). At that moment five demons came toward him: Wrath, Anger, Fury, Destruction, and Annihilation. Moses prostrated himself on the steps before the Most High, and indeed, there was not a corner into which he did not hurl himself as he invoked the merit of the fathers. He said: Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Whereupon three of the demons fled leaving only Anger and Fury. Moses remained prostrate and bowed down, as it is said: <i>And so I fell down before the Lord</i> (Deut. 9:25). He cried out: Master of the Universe: <i>For I was in dread of anger and fury</i> (ibid., v. 19). The Holy One, blessed be He, responded: Perhaps you will escape unharmed if you attack one while I attack the other. Moses then answered: My Master, arise, O Lord, against Anger, while I arise against Fury, as it is said: <i>Had not Moses his chosen stood before Him in the breach, to turn back His fury</i> (Ps. 106:23).",

Blessed be He, who fashioned man with wisdom just as He created the earth with wisdom, as is said: <i>The Lord with wisdom founded the earth</i> (Prov. 3:19). Concerning Bezalel it is stated: <i>He hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom and understanding, and in knowledge</i> (Exod. 35:31). The very attributes with which the Holy One, blessed be he, created His world and fashioned man were possessed by Bezalel. And he constructed the Tabernacle. Furthermore it is stated: <i>The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding He established the heavens; by His knowledge the depths were broken up</i> (Prov. 3:19–20). And about Bezalel it is written: <i>And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding, and in knowledge</i> (Exod. 35:31). The three attributes mentioned in the verse are referred to in the other: <i>Therefore who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number</i> (Job 5:9).",

He replied: My master, it is written: <i>And Thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth</i> (Gen. 28:14), and it is written elsewhere: <i>And make Thy seed as the sand of the sea</i> (ibid. 32:13), yet you tell me now to do this. He answered: If you want to know their number, you need only add together the first letter of the names of each of the tribes and this will give you their number. The resh in the word Reuben stands for two hundred thousand; the <i>shin</i> in Simeon stands for three hundred thousand, the <i>yods</i> in the names Judah, Issachar, and Joseph total thirty thousand, the <i>nun</i> in Naphtali accounts for fifty thousand, the <i>zayin</i> in Zebulun’s name is seven thousand, the <i>daled</i> in Dan is four thousand, the <i>gimmel</i> in Gad is three thousand, the <i>bet</i> in Benjamin is two thousand, and the <i>alef</i> in Asher is one thousand—totaling five hundred and ninety-seven thousand in all. The three thousand not accounted for were slain at the time of the episode of the golden calf, as it is said: <i>And the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses; and there fell of the people on that day about three thousand men</i> (Exod. 32:28). Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: You are taking the count to learn how many are missing. R. Menahem said in the name of R. Bebai: This may be compared to a king who had many sheep. When wolves attacked and destroyed some of them, the king told his shepherd: “Count the sheep and find out how many are missing.” Likewise, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Go, count the Israelites, and find out how many are missing.", 
        "10_Vayeshev, 0_Siman, 5_Paragraph": "The Holy One, blessed be He, however, befriended Israel and called them his <i>possessions, inheritance</i>, (and) <i>portion</i>, as it is said: <i>For the portion of the Lord is His people Jacob, the lot of His inheritance</i> (Deut. 32:9); <i>and ye shall be Mine own treasure among all the peoples</i> (Exod. 19:5); <i>and I have planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed</i> (Jer. 2:21). Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, concern Himself from the very beginning of time with the genealogies of the nations? This may be likened to a king who dropped a pearl into sand and pebbles. The king was compelled to search the sand and the pebbles to recover the pearl. As soon as he recovered the pearl, however, he discarded the sand and the pebbles, for he was only interested in retrieving the pearl.", 
        "15_Vaera, 2_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "<i>And Aaron forthwith cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent</i> (Exod. 7:10). Whereupon Pharaoh said: “Is this the full power of your God? Why, my magicians travel throughout the world performing such feats.” <i>Then Pharaoh called also</i> (ibid., v. 11) the youths, and babes of five, yea, even of four years, and each of them cast his rod. It is written: <i>Pharaoh called also</i> because he disdained at first to summon his magicians and sorcerers. Our sages of blessed memory said: He actually performed a great miracle with that rod. When one serpent is able to swallow other serpents, that is not unusual, but this serpent turned itself back into a rod again, as it is written: <i>But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods</i> (ibid., v. 12). If a man made bundles out of the rods that were cast to the ground to become serpents, there would have been more than ten bundles, yet Aaron’s rod swallowed them all and it became no larger than it was previously. When Pharaoh beheld that, he was amazed and exclaimed: “Surely if he should command the rod to swallow Pharaoh and his throne, it could swallow them.” That was the sign that He had given to Moses at the bush when He said: <i>This which is in thy hand, cast it to the earth</i> (ibid. 4:2). The word <i>this</i> alludes to Pharaoh, who is compared to a snake, as is said: <i>The Lord with His sore and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the slant serpent</i> (Isa. 27:1). When Moses withdrew from Pharaoh’s presence, the wicked one said: “If this son of Amram comes near me again, I will slay him, I will hang him, I will burn him.” That is why, when Moses returned, Pharaoh became like a rod. <i>And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he harkened not unto them, as the Lord had spoken</i> (Exod. 7:13). With reference to the first five plagues, the words <i>Pharaoh’s heart was hardened</i>, etc., are written, but after the fifth plague occurred and he still would not permit them to leave, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: Henceforth, even if he desires to send them away, I will not allow it. Hence, with reference to the last five plagues it is written: <i>But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart</i> (ibid. 10:20). Moses decreed what was to transpire, and the Holy One, blessed be He, executed it, as it is said:: <i>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee</i> (Job 22:28).",

Forthwith, a famine came into the world and when the famine reached the Land of Israel, Abraham said to his wife Sarah: “There is a famine in our land.” Our sages have maintained that no famine ever equaled it. He said to her: “Egypt is a pleasant land in which to dwell; let us go there, since there is a huge supply of bread and meat in that land.” Thereupon, the two of them departed for Egypt. When they reached the Egyptian border, and were standing on the bank of the Nile, our patriarch Abraham noticed that Sarah’s reflection in the river was like the radiance of the sun.<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Zohar I, 81b Cf. Bava Batra 16a, Ginzberg, <i>Legends of the Jews</i> 1:222.</i> Our sages concluded from this episode that any woman compared to Sarah was like a monkey in comparison to a human. Abraham said to her: <i>Now, indeed, I know that you are a beautiful woman</i> (ibid., v. 11). From this statement, we may conclude that he had not previously been aware of her beauty. He told her: “The Egyptians are a dissolute lot, for it is written of them: <i>Whole flesh is as the flesh of asses</i> (Ezek. 23:20), and so, I will hide you in this cabinet and lock it, for I fear for my safety if the Egyptians should see you.” He did so.",

He then seized Simeon and bound him, for it was Simeon who had hurled him into the pit. Furthermore, he wanted to separate him from Levi, lest they conspire together to kill him. Simeon cried out to his brothers: “You permitted this to happen to your brother Joseph, and now you are permitting the same thing to happen to me.” “What can we do?” they asked, “Our people will die of hunger” (if we resist). “Do whatever you wish,” he shouted, “but I challenge anyone to imprison me.”",

Did they actually sit on a threshing floor? No. We have learned that the Sanhedrin met in a semicircle, in order that each member might be able to see the others, while the two scribes sat before them to write down the testimony.

They would take a firstborn male child, kill him, and sprinkle him with salt and spices. Then they would write a demon’s name upon a gold tablet and place it beneath the child’s tongue while performing certain magical rites. After this, they inserted the corpse into a recess in the wall and lighted candles before it. They would then bow down before it, and it would speak to them in a whisper. This is stated in the verse <i>For the teraphim have spoken vanity</i> (Zech. 10:12). That is why Rachel stole them. Furthermore, she sought thereby to eradicate idolatry from her father’s home. However, Jacob was not aware that she had stolen them. Hence, it is written: <i>And Rachel stole the teraphim</i>.",

But is there actually a left hand on high? No; it means that those on the right (side of God) balance the scale on the side of merit, and those on the left balance the scale on the side of guilt. <i>And the Lord said: “Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?” And one said: On this manner; another said: On that manner</i> (ibid., v. 20).

Should a man to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has given a promise become frightened? However, Jacob said: Perhaps I became unworthy while living with Laban, the sinner, whose home was impure and sinful. Moses was given a sign, but he did not comprehend it, as it is said: <i>Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua</i>.

The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: It is as if I am bound (<i>asur</i>) to you, as though it were possible, by an oath. Because of whose merit am I bound to you?

From that very moment Israel merited reciting the Shema. Why? When Jacob was about to depart from this world, he reflected upon it and said: “My grandfather Abraham begot Isaac and Ishmael, and my father, Isaac, begot me and Esau; perhaps there is a blemish in my family.” When they heard this, they proclaimed in unison: <i>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one</i> (Deut. 6:4).

R. Simon argued: If that is so, do not the righteous who are buried outside the land of Israel suffer because of that? What does the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He constructs subterranean passages through which they revolve until they reach the land of Israel.

Ornaments were given to woman to wear only inside her home. After all, if one must not tempt a righteous person, how much less should one not tempt a thief. R. Samuel the son of Nahmani said: Observe what is written concerning Job: <i>I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then shall I look upon a maid?</i> (Job 31:1). Here indeed is evidence of Job’s righteousness. If (he would not look at) an unmarried woman, whom a man is permitted to look at, as he might marry her himself or match her with his son or his brothers, (then) all the more so would Job not look at a married woman. Hence a woman must remain in her home and not promenade about in the street lest she sin herself and cause men to sin through tempting them to look at the wife of another man. R. Judah the son of Shalum said: You know this to be so, as well, from the scriptural verse: <i>And God blessed them and said to them: “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue her</i> (Gen. 1:39). The word <i>subdue her</i> is written (without a <i>vav</i>) as a singular imperative, for it is the male that subdues the female, while the female does not subdue the male. Similarly, the male subdues the earth and the female does not. Hence, a woman must not meander about lest tragedy befall her. That is what happened to Dinah, Jacob’s daughter. She wandered about alone and was disgraced. Whence do we know this? We know it from what we read in the portion <i>And Dinah went out</i>.",

Only Moses would come and do his part, since he was troubled by the fact that he had not participated at all in the work done on the Tabernacle. Therefore Moses reared the Tabernacle, and neither Bezalel nor Oholiab nor the wise could do it.

Following his death, the slave gathered together all of the man’s possessions and brought them and the will to the land of Israel. He said to the son: “Your father is dead, and he has bequeathed to me all his possessions with the exception of any single thing you desire to select from among them.” What did the son do? He went to his teacher and related to him what had transpired. The teacher said to him: “Your father was indeed a man of profound wisdom, thoroughly informed in the law. He said to himself: ‘If I should simply entrust my property to the care of my slave, he will abscond with it and squander it; therefore, I will bequeath it to him as a gift so that he will guard it carefully, but to my son I will leave the privilege of selecting one thing for himself.’ When you go with him to court, let him bring the will with him, and then say to the court: ‘My masters, my father bequeathed to me the right to select the one thing I desire most from all his property, and the only thing I truly desire is this slave.’ Then you will obtain both the possessions and the slave.” He did as he was instructed, and the court gave him the property and the slave. For the law states that if a slave acquires property, both the property and the slave belong to the master. Solomon declared: <i>For to the man who is good in His sight He giveth wisdom and knowledge</i> (Eccles. 2:26), this was the father: <i>but to the sinner He giveth the task to gather and to heap up</i> (ibid.), this was the slave; <i>that he may leave to him that is good in the sight of God,</i> (ibid.) applies to the son.",

Joseph said to himself: “If I should permit them to depart during the night, no one will be able to overcome them, since they have been likened to beasts, as it is said: <i>Judah is lion’s whelp</i> (Deut. 33:22), <i>Dan shall be a serpent in the way, a horned snake in the path</i> (Gen. 49:17), and <i>Naphtali is a hind let loose</i> (ibid., v. 21).” After they had journeyed but a short distance from the city, Joseph said (to his steward): “If they go a great distance, no one will be able to overcome them, so arise, and pursue them while the fear of the city is still upon them. When you reach them, reprimand them harshly at first and then gently, saying” <i>Is not this it in which my lord drinketh</i>, etc. (ibid., v. 5).",

Nevertheless, he remained unwilling to leave, and so the angel struck him with the candle that was burning at his head. Thereupon he went out into the light of the world, though against his will. Upon going out the infant forgot everything he had witnessed and everything he knew. Why does the child cry out on leaving his mother’s womb? Because the place wherein he had been at rest and at ease was irretrievable and because of the condition of the world into which he must enter.", 
        "2_Bereshit, 0_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Similarly, in the verse <i>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One</i> (Deut. 6:4), if you should change the <i>dalet</i> in the word <i>ehad</i> (“one”) into a <i>resh,</i> the word would then read <i>aher</i> (“another”), and you would thereby destroy the world, since it is said: <i>For thou shalt not bow to another god</i> (Exod. 34:14). Likewise, in the verse <i>They have lied against the Lord</i> (Jer. 5:12), if you should change the preposition <i>bet</i> (“against”) into the preposition <i>kaf</i> (“like”), you would thereby destroy the world.",

When a man sees that his winepress is filled with grapes, and that his vineyard is ready for cutting, others may ask him: “What will you do with these grapes, since the vat is too small to contain them?” What does he do? He treads down the grapes in the vat and then puts in the new grapes. Then it is able to contain all his grapes. Similarly, though the entire world was submerged under water, the Holy One, blessed be He, declared: <i>Let the dry earth appear</i> (Gen. 1:9). The water thereupon cried out: “Though we fill the entire world, it is cramped for us. Whither shall we go?” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He trampled upon the ocean<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Normally the Mediterranean, but in this instance, as indicated a few lines below, the Dead Sea.</i> and slew its prince,<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ginzberg, <i>Legends of the Jews</i> 5:26, Bava Batra 74b Leviathan was a legendary sea animal destined to be eaten by the righteous in the future.</i> as it is said: <i>He stirreth up the sea with His power, and by His understanding he smiteth through Rahab</i> (Job 26:12). <i>Smiteth</i> is an expression that indicates slaying, as it is said: <i>And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head, yea, she pierced and struck through his temple</i> (Judg. 5:26). The seas mourn (<i>bohin</i>) to this very day because He slew the prince of the sea, as is said: <i>Hast thou entered into the springs (nibhe) of the sea?</i> (Job 38:16). Why did He slay him? Because a house that can accommodate a hundred living people can contain a thousand dead. That is why the ocean is called the Dead Sea. Ultimately, however, the Holy One, blessed be He, will heal it, as it is said: <i>When they shall enter into the sea of the putrid waters, the waters shall be healed</i> (Ezek. 47:8). When the other waters observed that the Holy One, blessed be He, had trampled upon the ocean, they fled from the loud cries of their fellow-waters, as it is said: <i>At Thy rebuke they fled, at the voice of Thy thunder they hastened away</i> (Ps. 104:7).",

The word <i>near</i> indicates that the promise the Holy One, blessed be He, had made to Abraham was soon to be fulfilled. <i>Near</i> also implies that it was the nearest way to return to Egypt. Furthermore <i>near</i> relates to the oath Abraham had sworn with Abimelech. <i>Now therefore, swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, or with my son, nor with my son’s son</i> (Gen. 21:23) was near fulfillment, even though his grandson had not yet been born. Furthermore, <i>near</i> implies that the previous war was too recent to risk another.<sup>1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The “previous war” being the one referred to in the continuation of the verse: <i>lest … the people repent when they see war</i> (Exod. 17:1). A tradition exists that the descendants of Ephraim left Egypt before the designated time and 300,000 were killed. See Ginzberg, <i>Legends</i>, vol. 3:8–9. Only ten escaped.</i> Another explanation of <i>Although that was near</i>. It was too close to the time in which the Canaanites had obtained the land, for it is written: <i>And in the fourth generation they shall come back hither</i> (ibid. 15:16), and the fourth generation had not yet come. God led the people about by the way of the wilderness (Exod. 12:18). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: If I lead them into the land by the most direct route, they will each take possession of a field and a vineyard and neglect the law. Therefore I will lead them through the wilderness for forty years and cause them to eat the manna and drink the water of the well so that the law may penetrate into their very beings.",

The second half of the title, Yelammedenu, is, in fact, part of a formula, <i>yelammedenu rabbenu</i>, “may our master teach us,” which is repeated frequently in this Midrash.

Alexandri explained it as follows: Two mules are being led along a road by men who despise each other. Suddenly, one of the mules falls to the ground. As the one who is leading the second mule passes by, he sees the mule of the other man stretched out beneath his load, and he says to himself: “Is it not written in the law that <i>If thou seest the ass of him that hateth thee lying under its burden, thou shalt forbear to pass him by; thou shalt verily release it for him</i> (Exod. 23:5)?” What did he do? He turned back to help the other man reload his mule, and then accompanied him on the way. In fact, while working with him he began to talk to the owner of the mule, saying: “Let us loosen it a little on this side, let us tighten it down on this side,” until he reloaded the animal with him. It came to pass that they had made peace between themselves. The driver of the mule (that had fallen) said to himself: “I cannot believe that he hates me; see how concerned he was when he saw that my mule and I were in distress.” As a result, they went into the inn, and ate and drank together. Finally they became extremely attached to each other. Hence, <i>Thou hast established equity, Thou hast executed justice and righteousness</i>.",

Similarly, <i>I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy</i>. He said: <i>Thou canst not see My face</i> (ibid., v. 20). Moses wanted to learn the rewards that were to be given to the righteous and why the wicked were at ease. The Holy One, blessed be He, answered: <i>Thou canst not see My face</i>. <i>My face</i> is mentioned here only with reference to the ease enjoyed by the wicked, as it is said: <i>And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them</i> (Deut. 7:10). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: <i>And I will take away My hand</i> (Exod. 33:23). That is to say, in this world I will not show you the rewards awaiting those that fear My name, but I shall in the world-to-come: <i>Whereof from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a God beside Thee who worketh for him that waiteth for him</i> (Isa. 64:3).",

Isaac propounded the query: Now that we have no prophet, no priest, no sacrifice, no Temple, no altar, who will atone for us?

Another explanation of why he broke them. When Moses saw that they were doomed, he sought a pretext through which to save them. He said: It is written on the tablets that he who sacrifices to gods will be excommunicated, and so, I will break them and say to the Holy One, blessed be He: Until now they did not know the punishment for idolatry.

You must not be of the opinion that only the captives reacted in that manner, for the slaves and handmaidens did likewise, as is said: <i>Even unto the firstborn of the maidservants that is behind the mill</i> (Exod. 11:5); that is, even those who were legally bound to the millers.

Scripture states elsewhere concerning him: <i>But with righteousness shall he judge the poor</i> (Isa. 11:4), <i>and he shall bring forth the top stone with shoutings of “Grace, grace, unto it”</i> (Zech. 4:7).

Similarly, the prophet said: <i>In that day shall Egypt be like unto woman</i> (Isa. 19:16). Why? Because he had said: <i>My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself</i> (Ezek. 29:3). Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: <i>See, I have set thee in God’s stead before Pharaoh</i>. Why did He do this?

He exiled him into the desert though he was a king, and compelled him to eat grass like a beast, as it is said: <i>Thou shalt be made to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee</i> (Dan. 4:29). To the beasts and the cattle he appeared like a female beast, and they had intercourse with him, as it is said: <i>The destruction of the beast, which made them afraid</i> (<i>yehitan</i>) (Hab. 2:17). This corresponds to what is stated in the verse <i>Neither shalt thou make marriages</i> (<i>tithaten</i>) <i>with them</i> (Deut. 7:3).

Rabba then said: ‘Let us consider this question in relation to the ninth day of Ab.<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The ninth of Ab is a fast-day commemorating the destruction of the Temple.</i> If the ninth day of Ab occurs on a Friday, an unsalted, roasted egg may be brought and eaten, so that one might enter the Sabbath free from hunger.’”<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fast would thus be concluded before the Sabbath began.</i>",

And thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt</i> (ibid., v. 18). At Sinai, as it is written: <i>And unto Moses he said: “Come up unto the Lord, thou, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel”</i> (ibid. 24:1). <i>In the Tent of Meeting whither Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel</i> (Lev. 9:1).

When were they counted to meet a need? When Moses took the census. When were they counted unnecessarily? At the time of David. <i>Then they shall give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord</i> (Exod. 30:12).

What is meant by this verse? Whatsoever the Holy One, blessed be He, desires to do, He may do, and none may stay His hand. What then can be the meaning of <i>And who may say unto Him: “What doest Thou?” whoso keepeth the commandment</i>, etc.? These words <i>whoso keepeth the commandment</i> allude to the righteous men who perform the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He. And it is their decree that He fulfills, as it is written: <i>Thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee, and the light shall shine upon thy ways</i> (Job 22:28). An example of this is what occurred after they made the golden calf. Though the Holy One, blessed be He, desired to destroy them, our master, Moses, restrained the Holy One, blessed be He, as though that were possible, just as a man restrains his companion. Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: <i>And now let Me be</i> (Exod. 32:10). We learn this as well from the verse: <i>Let Me alone that I may destroy them</i> (Deut. 9:14). Therefore Scripture says: <i>Who may say unto him: “What doest thou?” whoso keepeth the commandment</i>.",

Daniel went to him, trembling, as is said: <i>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was appalled for a while, and his thoughts affrighted him. The king spoke and said: “Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation, affright thee”</i> (ibid., v. 16). <i>Belteshazzar answered and said: “My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine adversaries”</i> (ibid.).<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse seems to suggest that Daniel is cursing Israel, when in fact he is threatening Nebuchadnezzar.</i> Who was Nebuchadnezzar’s hater? Israel. Why? He had killed (some of) them, destroyed the Temple, and exiled (the rest of) them. Then Daniel raised his eyes heavenward and said: “My Master, My Lord, let the dream and its explanation be fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar, your enemy and your adversary.” When Nebuchadnezzar beheld the dream and heard the explanation, he inquired of Daniel: “What do you advise me to do?” He replied: “The unhappy ones whom you have exiled from your land are starving, thirsty, and naked. Open your storehouses and feed them if you would counteract the dream,” as is said: <i>Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; that there may be a lengthening of thy prosperity</i> (ibid., v. 24).",

Hence Scripture states: <i>And this is it that their father spoke to them</i>. “Unto them” is not written here but rather <i>to them</i> (<i>lahem</i>), thus indicating that their father told them: In the future a prophet will bless you in a like manner. Where I leave off blessing you, he will begin. And so Moses did, as it is said: <i>And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel</i> (Deut. 33:1).

It is written: <i>And Leah went out to meet him</i> (Gen. 30:16). Ezekiel declared: <i>Behold, everyone that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying: As the mother, so her daughter</i> (Ezek. 16:44). <i>To see</i> should be read as “to be seen,” for though she went out to see, she was, in fact, seen, as it is said: <i>And Shechem the son of Hamor … saw her</i> (Gen. 34:2).",

Another comment on <i>Then He openeth the ears of men</i>: This verse refers to our patriarch Jacob, to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed the time of redemption. Jacob indicated that he wished to disclose this information to his sons, when he said to them: <i>Gather yourselves together, so that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the end of days</i> (Gen. 49:1). However, the Holy One, blessed be He, sealed up his lips to restrain him from doing so. Hence, it says: <i>Their chastisement sealeth the decree</i>.",

Another comment on <i>pahaz. Pasata</i> (“you trampled on the law”), <i>hillalta</i> (“you have degraded your birthright”), <i>zar</i> (“you have made yourself a stranger <i>like water</i>).

He ordered his young men to follow him, and they did so. But in the middle of the river the water reached his neck. Thereupon, Abraham lifted his eyes heavenward and cried out: Master of the Universe, You have chosen me; You have instructed me; You revealed Yourself to me; You have declared: I am one and You are one, and through You shall my name be made known in My world. You have ordered me: Offer, Isaac, thy son, as a sacrifice, and I did not refuse; but now, as I am about to fulfill Thy command, these waters endanger my life. If either I or my son, Isaac, should drown, who will fulfill Your decrees, and who will proclaim the Unity of Your Name?

The word <i>koh</i> is also contained in the words spoken by Moses to the priests, as it is said: <i>Thus</i> (<i>koh</i>) <i>shall ye bless</i> (Num. 6:22).

This may be compared to a king who makes his treasures available to a certain individual who later begins to oppress the poor, kill the widows, embarrass the needy, despoil the naked, do violence and theft, indulge in falsehood, and squander the king’s treasures. Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, opens His treasure to the wealthy, with all that He possesses in it, as it is said: <i>Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold</i> (Hag. 2:8). Then the rich man begins to loan money on interest. And he starts to taunt the widows and oppress them with interest, to embarrass the poor, and to humiliate the naked who seek charity from him, even though the Holy One, blessed be He, had declared: <i>Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker</i> (Prov. 17:5). If a man’s neighbor is in debt to him for a hundred zuzim, he beats him, strips him, does violence to him, steals from him, and destroys the pledges he entrusted to him. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, says: <i>Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou was not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled</i> (Isa. 33:1). The Holy One, blessed be He, gave him wealth from His treasure house, which was a treasure house of truth, and he made it into a treasure house of falsehood, as it is said: <i>Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, ye have eaten the fruit of lies, for thou didst trust</i> (Hos. 10:13). Hence, <i>when the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is not more</i> (Prov. 10:25).

Inasmuch as you said <i>sit (shevah)</i>, your descendants will say: <i>Return (shuvah), O Lord, unto the tens of thousands</i> (ibid., v. 36). However, because Esau said <i>Let my father arise</i>, I will exact retribution from him through that very expression, as it is said: <i>Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered</i> (Ps. 68:2). <i>Let my father arise</i>. At that moment Isaac recognized his voice and began to tremble. <i>Who art thou?</i> (Gen. 27:32), he asked. When Jacob entered the room, a fragrance from the Garden of Eden accompanied him; a fragrance so pleasant that the righteous one’s mind was set at ease, as is said: <i>See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed</i> (ibid., v. 27). However, when Esau entered, Gehenna was revealed to him. Hence, it says: <i>Isaac trembled very exceedingly</i> (ibid., v. 33).

R. Hanina the son of R. Abahu explained: It is not written “will be at thy right hand” but <i>may fall at thy right hand</i>. That is so because the left hand, which is not stretched out as frequently in the performance of good deeds as the right hand, is capable of bringing about the downfall of only a thousand demons, while the right hand, which is constantly stretched out in the performance of good deeds, is able to bring about the fall of ten thousand demons.

It may be possible to maintain on the basis of this verse that a fetus extracted by a Caesarean operation is also to be considered a firstborn. Hence the Scripture states: <i>All that openeth the womb is Mine</i> (Exod. 34:19). That is, a male that opens the womb (through natural birth). <i>Both of men and beast</i>. The firstborn of humans are likened to the firstborn of beasts. Just as the birth of a premature beast releases the one born after it from the law of the firstborn, so a firstborn human being, following a miscarriage, is released from the law of the firstborn.

Pharaoh did likewise. <i>When he saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he continued to sin</i> (Exod. 9:34). The gentiles add to their sins, but in the case of Israel <i>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion, he will no more carry thee away into captivity; He will punish thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will uncover thy sins</i> (Lam. 4:22).",

Joshua the son of Levi said: When they transgressed by means of the golden calf, they sinned through Aaron, who said to them: <i>Whosoever hath any gold</i> (Exod. 32:24).

When Israel heard the sound of His voice, it appeared at first to come from the south, and so they ran to the south to receive the voice. In the south the sound appeared to reverse itself and to emanate from the north, whereupon they ran to the north. In the north it shifted as though it came from the east, and so they hastened to the east to await the voice; then it appeared to shift once more from the east to the west, and they ran to the west. In the west, it turned about as though it came from the heavens, but when they lifted their eyes toward heaven, it seemed to come from the earth.

After all, a single spark from your forge can consume it all.” Similarly, when our patriarch Jacob became terrified at the sight of Esau and the chiefs, and cried out: “Who will be able to assist me against them?” The Holy One, blessed be He, answered: A spark from you will consume them.

If the dust could spread over the whole of Egypt, which takes forty days to traverse, how much more likely it is that his voice could traverse forty parasangs. R.

They ate them twice a day for thirty days, until the manna descended for them. <i>Neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals</i> (Exod. 12:39).

How far should one go in reproving one’s neighbor? Rav said: Until his neighbor strikes him. Samuel contended: Until he curses him. R. Johanan held: Until he becomes angry.

This is the law: <i>When a man dieth in a tent, everything shall be unclean</i> (Num. 19:14). <i>Thou art fairer than the children of men</i> (Ps. 45:3). Moses is merely <i>called</i> human (but his essence is of a higher level). In what way?

He cast Korah and his followers, while still alive, into the pit, as it is said: <i>So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit</i> (Num. 16:32). The Holy One, blessed be He, issued a decree, but he (Moses) caused it to be revoked, as is written: <i>Therefore He said that He would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen stood before Him in the breach</i> (Ps. 106:23). <i>Grace is poured upon thy lips</i> (ibid. 45:3) indicates that he spoke in their defense, as it is said: <i>And Moses besought the Lord</i> (Exod. 32:11), and <i>He did not depart until the Lord repented</i> (ibid., v. 14).",

They did not give a voluntary offering, saying: these others are making the Tabernacle, and to us he says to give a voluntary offering?! The Holy One said to them: by your lives, I will make it known to you that I do not need you. What is written there? “…and they brought him more gifts every morning.” (Exodus 36:3) R’ Yochanan said: they brought all the gifts of the Tabernacle in the course of two mornings, and there was more than what was needed.

So Moses blessed them.” (Exodus 39:43) With what blessing did he bless them? He said to them: may the Divine Presence rest on the works of your hands.

He declared: Even though the Holy One, blessed be He, has decreed that we should eat unclean food, He did so only to test us. We will do our part, let Him do His part. Then he said to the chief of the officers: <i>Try thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s food; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants</i> (Dan. 1:12–13).

Perhaps his merit will assist us. After all, has not the king found us to be ten times as wise as all his magicians and sorcerers?” Forthwith, the Holy One, blessed be He, made the officer feel well disposed toward Daniel: <i>So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and tried them for ten days.

The night borrows from the sun, and the sun from the night, yet it is said: <i>The sun and moon stand still in their habitation</i> (Hab. 3:11).

Since the word <i>set aside</i> is used in the former verse, just as in the latter verse, one may not sanctify the priests’ share of the offering except during the life of its mother, so in this instance one may not sanctify the priests’ share except during the lifetime of its mother. If this is so, then just as the latter verse refers only to male animals, so the former verse applies only to male animals. Hence, when Scripture says <i>Whatsoever passeth under the rod</i>, it means (to include) male and female. <i>All that openeth the womb</i> indicates that a prematurely born offspring is exempted from the law of the firstborn.

Moses merited that the Shekhinah itself should be concerned about him. Hence it is said: <i>He buried him in the valley</i> (ibid. 34:6). What is more, not only did Pharaoh’s servants, the elders of his house, and the elders of the land of Egypt escort Jacob, but Joseph’s coffin was escorted by the Shekhinah, the ark, the priests, the Levites, and the clouds of glory. Furthermore, as Joseph’s coffin was borne alongside the ark of the Eternal One through the desert, the nations would inquire of Israel: “What are these two arks?” And the Israelites would reply: “This one is the ark of the one who died, and the other is the ark of the Living One of the world.” “Is it customary to carry the ark of a dead person alongside the ark of the Eternal, the Living One of the world?” they would ask.

Though it is written about the Holy One, blessed be He: <i>He declareth His word to Jacob</i> (Ps. 147:19), He did not disclose this matter to him because of the pact of excommunication.

Surely, if he had owned a mattress or a cushion he would have placed them under his head, yet after he joined Laban’s household he became wealthy, as is said: <i>And the man increased exceedingly</i> (ibid. 30:43). Why did he become wealthy? Because of the power of the blessings his father had bestowed upon him, as it is said: <i>And give thee the blessing of Abraham</i> (ibid. 28:4). What was Abraham’s blessing? <i>And the Lord blessed Abraham in all things</i> (ibid. 24:1). After his return from Laban’s house, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: Now I must bless him Myself. Immediately, the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared before him and blessed him, as it is said: <i>And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Padan-aram, and blessed him</i> (ibid. 35:9).",

If he wounds with a knife, he heals with a plaster, but the Holy One, blessed be He, heals with what He wounds. When He smote Job, He did so with a tempest, as it said: <i>And multiply my wounds without cause</i> (Job 9:17), and when He healed him He did so with a whirlwind, as it is said: <i>Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind</i> (ibid. 38:1). When He sent Israel into exile, He did so with clouds, as is said: <i>How hath the Lord covered with a cloud</i> (Lam. 2:1), and when He brought them back, He did so with a cloud, as it is said: <i>Who are these that fly as a cloud?</i> (Isa. 60:8). When He dispersed them, He scattered them like doves, as it is said: <i>But they that shall at all escape of them, shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning</i> (Ezek. 7:16). When He gathered them together, He did so as doves: <i>As the doves to their cotes</i> (Isa. 60:8). When He blesses them, He does so only while “looking forth,” as it is said: <i>Look forth from Thy holy habitation</i> (Deut. 26:15), and when He exacts retribution from their enemies, He does so while “looking forth,” as it is said: <i>And it came to pass on the morning watch that the Lord looked forth through the pillar of fire and of cloud</i> (Exod. 14:24). When the pillar of cloud descended it turned (the water) into mud, and the pillar of fire scalded them. The hoofs of their horses became entangled (and they fell), causing the horses to fall upon the mares that were beneath. Thus it says: <i>Then did the horses’ hoofs stamp by reason of their prancings, the prancings of the mighty ones</i> (Judg. 5:22). He confused and befuddled them. He took away their reasoning power, and they did not know what to do.",

The eighth song is <i>A psalm, a song at the dedication of the house, of David</i> (Ps. 30:1). The fact is that Solomon was the one who dedicated it, as it is said: <i>So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord</i> (I Kings 8:63). However, because David had set his heart upon dedicating it, the song was ascribed to him. Similarly, it says: <i>Lord, remember unto David all his afflictions; how he swore unto the Lord, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: “Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, nor go up into the bed that is spread for me … until I find out a place for the Lord, a dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.” Lo, we heard it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood</i> (Ps. 132:1–6).

We know this from the verse: <i>And there came a man of God unto Eli and said unto him: “Thus saith the Lord: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt?”</i> (I Sam. 2:27). It was for this reason that Moses said: Throughout all these years my brother prophesied, and if I should now intrude into his area (of service) he will be deeply distressed. That is why Moses did not wish to go. The Holy One, blessed be He, replied to Moses: Aaron will not be offended. In fact, not only will he not be displeased, but he will rejoice. You know this is so, for He said to him: <i>And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee; when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart</i> (Exod. 4:14).

What purpose do these mirrors serve? The Holy One, blessed be He, called out to Moses: Moses, do you mistreat them because of these? These very mirrors produced the hosts in Egypt. Take them and make a basin of brass and its base for the priests, that they may sanctify the priests from it, as it is said: <i>And he made the laver of brass, and base thereof of brass, of the mirrors of the serving women that did service</i> (ibid. 38:8), for they had produced all the hosts.

When R. Josiah was about to depart from this world, he told those standing at his side: Summon my disciples.

But when he lowered his hand, Israel was destined to allow its knowledge of the law, that was given through his hands, to diminish. <i>But Moses’ hands were heavy</i> (Exod. 17:12). Moses hands grew tired, as do those of a man who holds three jars of water suspended from his hands. <i>And they took a stone, and put it under him</i> (ibid.).

Then the angel instructed me and told me: “Take my words to heart, keep my commandments and it shall be as described above.” The Holy One, blessed be He, then warned him concerning everything that would transpire, and the angel led him about from morning until evening. He showed him where he would die and where he would be buried. Then he led him about and walked with him through the world, showing him the righteous and the wicked and everything else. In the evening he brought him back to his mother’s womb. The Holy One, blessed be He, fashioned <i>bolts and doors</i> (Job 38:10) before him, as it is said: <i>Or who shut up the sea with the doors?</i> (ibid., v. 8), and <i>I have put My words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of My hand</i> (Isa. 51:6).

Levi said: This may be compared to a priest who had a foolish servant. On one occasion, after the priest had left the city, his servant went to the cemetery to seek him. He inquired of the men loitering about: “Have you seen my master here?” They replied: “Isn’t your master a priest?” Indeed, he replied. “Fool,” they said, “who has ever seen a priest in a cemetery?”<sup>7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Priests are not permitted to enter cemeteries (Lev. 21:1 and the halakhic codes).</i> Moses and Aaron likewise rebuked Pharaoh, saying: “Fool, these gods that you mentioned are all dead, but the Lord, the true God, is a living God, the King of the Universe.” Pharaoh asked them: “Is He young or old? How many cities has He captured? How many provinces has He humbled? How long has He been King?” They replied: “The strength and power of our God permeates the world. He was before the world was created, and He will be at the end of all worlds. He fashioned you and placed within you the breath of life.” “What else has He done?” he asked. They replied: He stretched forth the heavens and the earth and His voice <i>heweth out flames of fire</i> (Ps. 29:7); <i>He rends the mountains and breaketh in pieces the rocks</i> (I Kings 19:11); His bow is of fire; His arrows are flames; His spear is a torch; His shield is of the clouds; His sword is lighning; He formeth mountains and hills; covereth the mountains with the grass; the heavens with clouds; He bringeth down rain and dew, cạuseth plants to grow and fruits to ripen; He afflicteth the beasts; He formeth the embryo in the womb of the mother and bringeth it forth into the light of the world. <i>He removeth kings and setteth up kings</i> (Dan. 2:21). He said to them: “You have been speaking falsehood from the start! For I am the lord of the world, and I created myself and the Nile, as is written: <i>The Nile is mine, I made it</i> (Ezek. 29:3).” At that moment he gathered all the wise men of Egypt, and said to them: “Perhaps you have heard about the god of these?” They said to him: “We have heard that he is the son of wise men and the son of early kings.” The Holy One, blessed be He said: They call themselves wise men, but Me (they call) a son of wise men! By your life, I will destroy you for your wisdom, as is written: <i>All the wisdom of Pharaoh’s advisers, their plans are foolish. How can you say to Pharaoh, “I am a son of wise men, I am the son of early kings?</i> (Isa. 19:11). See what is written of them: <i>The wisdom of his wise men and the understanding of his discerning men will be hidden</i> (ibid. 29:14). He (Pharaoh) answered them (Moses and Aaron): “I do not understand what you are saying. <i>Who is God that I should harken to His voice?</i> (Exod. 5:2).” The Holy One, blessed be He responded: Evil one! <i>Who is God?</i> you asked. (With) <i>who</i> (<i>mi</i>) you will be plagued. <i>Mi</i> equals fifty in gematria.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Mem</i> = 40, <i>yod</i> = 10.</i> These are the fifty plagues which the Holy One, blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt. What does Scripture say regarding Egypt? <i>The sorcerers said to Pharaoh: “This is the finger of God”</i> (ibid. 8:15), and regarding the sea, what does (Scripture) say? <i>Israel saw the great hand</i> (ibid. 14:31). How many plagues did they suffer with a finger? Ten plagues. Calculate the five fingers on a <i>great hand;</i> each one corresponds to ten, hence fifty. Another interpretation: <i>mi</i> (“who”), switch the letters of <i>mi</i> (<i>mem-yod</i>)and you spell <i>yam</i> (<i>yod-mem</i>, “sea”); the Red Sea will inform you who God is. By your life! With your own mouth you will exclaim: ‘The Lord is righteous.’ You have said: I will not send, but tomorrow you will take hold of each of them by the hand and say: <i>Go in peace, take even thy sheep and thy cattle, and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste</i> (ibid. 12:33).

The verse is not written “blessed them” but rather <i>blessed Him</i>. R. Simeon the son of Yohai declared: Every one who assists Israel is considered to be assisting the Holy Spirit, as is said: <i>Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to help of the Lord</i> (Judg. 5:23). Does the Holy One, blessed be He, actually require assistance? This verse teaches us that one who aids Israel is considered to be aiding the Holy Spirit. R. Ishmael said: You find that righteous men bless their children when they are about to leave this life. That is why Isaac said to Esau: <i>And bless thee before the Lord before my death</i> (Gen. 27:7).

Eliezer was of the opinion that it was put there for the Messianic era, for the time about which the prophet Jeremiah said to Israel: Why do you not devote yourself to the Torah?

Your fathers occupied themselves with the Law, and see how they were fed; concern yourselves with the Law, and I shall feed you from this jar.

Then Moses cried out: But Master of the Universe, who will make known to the nations that Thou hast forgiven them?

Those in charge of the vessel do not have the same concern for the man’s animals and possessions as they have for the man himself, but the Holy One, blessed be He, is as concerned for the beast as for the man, as is said: <i>And His tender mercies are over all His works</i> (Ps. 145:9).

Why was all that necessary? When he (was sold into slavery and) left them, he did not possess any signs of maturity but now he stood before them like a king, with the mark of maturity upon him (his beard).",

A lady asked R. Yosé the son of Halafta: “What is meant by <i>He giveth wisdom to the wise</i> (Dan. 2:21)? Should not the verse say ‘He giveth wisdom to the fool’?” He replied: “My daughter, if two men came to you to borrow money, one of them being poor and the other rich, to whom would you lend the money?” She answered: “I would lend the money to the rich man, of course.” “Why?” he asked. And she replied: “If the rich man should suffer a loss, he would still have sufficient money to repay me, but if the poor man lost my money, how could he possibly repay me?” He said to her: “Let your ears hear what your lips have said. If the Holy One, blessed be He, gave wisdom to fools, they would still sit in privies, in filthy alleys, and in bathhouses, and would not put the wisdom to use. Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, gives wisdom to the wise, who sit in the chambers of the elders, in synagogues, and in house of study, and they utilize that wisdom.” Therefore it is written: <i>He hath filled him with wisdom</i> (Exod. 35:35).",

He introduced old age, for whenever he and his son entered a city, the inhabitants were unable to determine which of them was the elder of the two (and therefore the one) to be honored. Abraham was disturbed by this, and so he said: Master of the Universe, how shall one distinguish between father and son? The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: Be assured, I will begin with you (to distinguish between father and son), as it is said: <i>Abraham was old</i> (Gen. 24:1).",

And just as the Tabernacle bears witness, so He said: <i>I will bear witness against you today</i> (Deut. 4:26). He did so again when the prophet appeared in heaven, after Israel renounced the Holy One, blessed be He. He exclaimed: <i>Hear, O heavens, give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken: “Children I have reared, and brought up and they have rebelled against Me”</i> (Isa. 1:2).

A great love existed between Me and you, as it is said: <i>I have loved you</i> (Mal. 1:2), but ye have engendered hatred upon yourselves. R. Joshua the son of Levi said: <i>How would I put thee among the sons</i> implies that though I defended you, you have condemned yourselves, for the word <i>put thee</i> is an expression that indicates guilt, as in the verse <i>If there is put upon him a ransom</i> (Exod. 21:30). R. Berechiah argued: <i>Put thee</i> is an expression that implies neglect, as in the verse <i>And I will put it to waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed, but there shall come up briars and thorns</i> (Isa. 5:6). You were as precious to Me as a beautiful vineyard is to the man who plows it, clears it of stones, and hoes it, but then you declared yourselves free of Me. <i>Wherefore, when I looked at it that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes</i> (ibid., v. 4).",

Thus the Israelites said to Moses: Between you and Pharaoh we are being destroyed. Hence it is stated: <i>And Moses returned unto the Lord</i> (ibid., v. 22), and said: <i>Wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with this people?</i> (ibid. 5:22). If you should say: What difference does it make to you? <i>Then why is it that Thou hast sent me?</i> (ibid.). <i>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name he hath dealt ill with this people</i> (ibid., v. 23). Your name is a source of life and healing to all the inhabitants of the world, but despite Your name he has dealt ill with this people.

How do we know that He did so? It is so written: <i>And he divided himself against them, he and his servants by night, and he smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus</i> (Gen. 14:15). Our sages maintained: The night divided itself of its own accord, while R.

However, if he should put it on beneath his other garments, without the mixed material touching his body, he is permitted to do so, for it is said: <i>Neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together</i>. The words <i>upon thee</i> signify that it may not be worn as an outer garment but that it may be placed underneath (i.e. closer to the body). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: Keep My commandments and My statues. Why? Because the consequence of a good deed is another good deed, but the result of committing a sin is another sin. Ben Azzai stated that one good deed results in another good deed, and one sin produces another sin. R. Meir said: For every good deed a man performs, an angel is assigned to watch over him. If he does one good deed, one angel is assigned to him, and if he performs many good deeds, many angels are assigned to him, as it is said: <i>For he will give His angels charge over thee</i> (Ps. 91:11). Every time a man increases the number of good deeds he performs, he adds to his good name. You find that a man is known by three names: the name by which his father and mother call him, the name by which other men call him, and the one he earns for himself; the most important name is the one he earns for himself.<sup>2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His good deeds are apparent to all.</i>",

Did the Holy One, blessed be He, fashion only the eye and the ear? Did He not form all of man’s organs? What is the meaning of the words <i>The hearing ear and the seeing eye</i>? You find that three of man’s organs fashioned by the Holy One, blessed be He, are under the control of man, and three are not under his control. Man controls the functioning of his hands, his mouth, and his feet. How is that? In the case of his hands, if he desires to, he may devote them to sacred purposes, such as building a sukkah, fashioning a lulav, a shofar, (or) fringes, or writing the (scriptural) portions which are deposited in phylacteries and mezuzahs. Conversely, if he so desires, he may steal, shed innocent blood, or attack travelers with his hands. Indeed, he can commit many transgressions with his hands. As to his mouth, if he desires, he can study the Torah, speak kindly, extol, praise, and pray unto the Holy One, blessed be He, and he can also sing psalms. Conversely, if he so desires, he can speak slanderously, blaspheme and revile the Lord, and swear falsely with his mouth. With regard to his feet, a man may choose to use them to go about in the performance of good deeds—to visit the sick, comfort the mourner, bury the dead, and to do other charitable deeds; but conversely, if he so desires, he can use them to transgress—to commit adultery, to murder, or to steal.",

Why was that? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, concealed the fact of Joseph’s survival in order to fulfill the decree <i>Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger</i> (Gen. 15:13). If that had not been so, would not Isaac his father, a prophet, who was still alive and aware that Joseph still lived have disclosed it to him? He had said to himself: If the Holy One, blessed be He, concealed it from him, shall I tell him?

The Holy One, blessed be He, put them to shame. Proof of this is contained in the verse: <i>O Lord, in the city Thou wilt despise their semblance</i> (Ps. 73:20). Why is the word <i>ba’ir</i> (“in the city”) used?<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Word-play on <i>ba’er</i> (“burn”) and <i>ba’ir</i> (“in the city”).</i> There is a proverb which states: The brigand is hung at the place of his crime, <i>And therefore, O Lord (in the city), Thou wilt despise their semblance</i>. Hence, <i>for fools, they carry away shame. The wise shall inherit honor</i> refers to Moses and Aaron, and <i>Fools, they carry away shame</i> alludes to Dathan and Abiram. Why is that so? When the manna descended for the Israelites, Moses said to them: <i>Let no man leave of it till the morning</i> (Exod. 16:19). Everyone did not listen to Moses; some of them permitted some of it to remain. Those that did so were Dathan and Abiram. R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R.

He sets it in the midst of seven other palaces and then decrees: “Anyone who approaches my daughter will be considered as though he were approaching me.” The Tabernacle was called by two names: <i>The Tabernacle of the testimony</i>, which is the Torah, and elsewhere: <i>A Tabernacle of the Lord</i> (Lev. 17:4). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Anyone who despises My daughter is considered as though he were despising Me.

Because there was no water even in their water containers, as is said in the verse: <i>And the nobles send their lads for water; they come to the pits, and find no water; they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads</i> (Jer. 14:3).

Because in that number resides the power to set aside retribution.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because ten comprise a minyan and so they could beseech God as a congregation.</i> For example, when the Holy One, blessed be He, was about to destroy Sodom, our patriarch Abraham pleaded for heavenly mercy in their behalf. He spoke first of fifty men, but finally reduced the number to ten, as it is said: <i>Peradventure ten shall be found there</i> (ibid. 18:31). Ten men also comprise a congregation, as is said: <i>How long shall I bear with this evil congregation</i> (Num. 14:27), and <i>God standeth in the congregation of God</i> (Ps. 82:1). Hence Scripture states: <i>Joseph’s ten brethren went down</i> (Gen. 42:3). Just as in the case of Sodom, Scripture speaks here of ten. <i>And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came</i> (Gen. 42:5), in order that no one would recognize them. The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: Because you have said: <i>We shall see what will become of his dreams</i> (ibid. 37:20), his dream was fulfilled.

Or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?</i> (Num. 23:19). R. Samuel the son of Nahman contended: The conclusion of this verse contradicts the beginning. It begins: <i>God is not a man that He should lie</i>, but subsequently it reverses itself by stating: <i>when He hath said, will He not do it?</i> What is meant by <i>God is not a man that He should lie?</i> It indicates that when the Holy One, blessed be He, promises to perform a good deed, He does so. For example: A mortal king may promise his son a gift, but if his son angers him, he will withdraw his promise. However, if the Holy One, blessed be He, promises to do a good deed, He will not retract His promise even though they sin against Him. Scripture states: <i>And He gave them the lands of the nations, and they took the labor of the peoples in possession; that they might keep His statutes and observe His Laws</i> (Ps. 105:44–45), and even though they neglected to keep His commandments and to observe His laws, He gave them the land. Similarly, though the Israelites erected the golden calf, when Moses pleaded for mercy in their behalf, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: <i>Depart, go up hence, thou and the people thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt</i> (Exod. 33:1).

Did you not know that they were fleeing from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow and from the grievousness of war? When your father suffered from thirst in the desert, I disclosed the well of water to him, as is said: <i>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water</i> (Gen. 21:19), yet now you do such a thing.

This causes the first grade of oil to flow. They remove the oil, and then crush them (the olives) a second time, expelling the second grade of oil.

For example, if a barrel of balsam oil is placed in a filthy area, its scent permeates that area, but if it is placed in another locality (a clean area), its scent might not permeate that area. The other argued: If he was righteous in such a generation, how much more righteous would he have been had he lived in any other generation!

It is written: <i>Remember thy congregation which Thou has acquired of old</i> (Ps. 74:2). <i>Of old</i> alludes to the time before the world was created. And they exist now, for it is said: <i>Ye are standing this day</i> (Deut. 29:9), <i>But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive, every one of you this day</i> (ibid. 4:4); that they will exist in the future is indicated in the verse <i>And they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in the day that I do make, even Mine own treasure; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him</i> (Mal. 3:17).",

This refers to Ruth the Moabitess, from whom Solomon descended. <i>Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king</i> (I Chron. 29:23). What is written about Ehud? <i>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right side, and thrust it into his belly</i> (Judg. 3:21). <i>In the morning he devoureth prey</i> (Gen. 49:27) alludes to the fact that he thrust the sword into his belly; <i>and at even he divideth the spoil</i> refers to the land which he took as spoil.",

Pharaoh would also hug and kiss him, and the boy would ofttimes take the crown from his head and cast it to the ground, as he was later destined to do. That is why the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Hiram: <i>Therefore, have I brought forth a fire from the midst of thee, it hath devoured thee</i> (Ezek. 28:18).

Though an oath was taken there, it was called a pact of excommunication to teach us that an oath and a ban of excommunication are identical. Because the men of Jabesh-Gilead did not come unto the Lord, they were sentenced to death.", 
        "1_Introduction, 0_Paragraph": "<b>T</b>he genre of Jewish literature known as Midrash has been poetically described as “the hammer that awakens the slumbering sparks on the anvil of the Bible.” The midrashic process utilizes a variety of methods, including expositions, explanations, gematria, plays on words, legends, and parables, to broaden our understanding of the full meaning of the biblical text. The conscientious application of this methodology has made the Midrash Tanhuma, and the other Midrashim, a vital source of influence on Jewish life and thought throughout the centuries. The “hammer” of the Midrash elicited new insights into the historic events depicted in Scripture and produced a fuller understanding and awareness of the spiritual, moral, and ethical truths and values stated laconically in the Pentateuch.",

Did the Holy One, blessed be He, have nothing else to write about other than the chief of Timna, the chief of Lotan, etc.? He did so to teach us that from the very beginning of the creation of the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, concerned himself with the genealogies of the idolatrous nations so that it would not be left to them to describe for mankind their sterility and their degeneracy. How did He do that? When He came to the genealogy of the sons of Ham, He said: <i>The sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim … and Cush begot Nimrod</i> (Gen. 10:6–8); thus He indicated that they had become defiant, as it is said: <i>He began to be a mighty one in the earth</i> (ibid., v. 8). Similarly, when He said: <i>And Mizraim begot Ludim … whence went forth</i> (ibid., vv. 13–14), He did not say “he bore him” but <i>he went forth</i>, thereby informing us that he was the product of an incestuous relationship.",

Nedarim 1:36d, Y. Shabbat 11:5b.</i> How do we know about the man who vows and does not pay? It is written in Scripture: <i>When thou shall vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it</i> (Deut. 23:22), and it is written elsewhere: <i>It is a snare to a man rashly to say: “Holy,” and after vows to make inquiry</i> (Prov. 20:25). The words <i>after vows to make inquiry</i> signify that a man’s account book is opened and that angels testify against him by enumerating his sins. R. Samuel the son of Nahman stated: Everyone who borrows and fails to repay brings about the death of his wife, as it is said: <i>If thou hast not wherewith to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</i> (ibid. 22:27). Moses warned Israel about this, as is written: <i>When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not be slack to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee</i> (Deut. 23:22). Why is the word <i>require</i> repeated in this verse (i.e., written in the intensive form, <i>darash yidreshenu</i>)? It teaches us that He will require (i.e. inquire) of him with regard to what he has borrowed, and He will (also) require concerning his other sins, as it says: <i>And after vows to make inquiry</i> (Prov. 20:25).", 
        "24_Pekudei, 2_Siman, 13_Paragraph": "These are the four camps that the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Elijah of blessed memory, as it is said: <i>Go forth, and stand upon the mountain before the Lord and behold</i>, etc. (I Kings 19:11). Elijah said to Him: “What are they?” These are the four camps that you will see. He told Him: “Master of the Universe, I do not know what they are.” The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: These are the four experiences a man undergoes. They are: The strong and mighty winds of this world, for man’s days are as a wind that passeth by. After the wind comes the earthquake, which corresponds to the day of death, for death is like an earthquake, causing the body of man to quake. After the earthquake comes fire, and after death comes the judgment of the netherworld, which is composed of fire. Following the fire there is a still, small voice, and after the judgment of the netherworld there is this great day of judgment, as is said. <i>For great is the day of the Lord</i> (Joel 2:11). And none shall remain in His world except the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said: <i>And the Lord alone shall be exalted on that day</i> (Isa. 2:11).", 
        "12_Vayigash, 8_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "<i>And his father wept for him</i>. After that Scripture states: <i>The Midianites sold him into Egypt</i> (Gen. 37:36). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Judah: Until now you had no sons, and did not experience the grief caused by sons, but since you tormented your father, and deceived him with the words <i>Joseph is without doubts torn to pieces</i> (ibid., v. 33), by your life, you shall wed, bury your children,<sup>12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">His sons Er and Onan sinned grievously and were slain (see Gen. 38:7–10).</i> and suffer the grief that comes with children.” What is written after this verse? <i>Judah went down from his brethren … and he took her … and bore a son</i> (ibid. 38:1–2). This teaches us that Judah became separated from his brothers. If at the time he had said to them: <i>Come, let us sell him</i> (ibid. 37:27), he had said instead: “Come, let us return him (to father),” they would have listened to him. Therefore, <i>Judah went down</i>. That is, he was deposed from his role as leader.", 
        "3_Noach, 6_Siman, 4_Paragraph": "After the Holy One, blessed be He, realized that they would not be drowned by the waters that gushed forth from the deep because of their height, He sent the fire upon them from above, as it is said: <i>And their abundance the fire hath consumed.</i> Furthermore, He turned the birds, the wild beasts, and the animals against them to reduce their numbers, as it says: <i>And all flesh perished that moved upon the earth, the birds, the animals, and the beasts,</i> etc. (Gen. 7:21). How did they perish? It was through the birds, the beasts, and the animals. When at long last they realized that they were about to be destroyed, they attempted to overturn the ark. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He surrounded the ark with lions, as it is said: <i>The Lord shut them in</i> (Gen. 7:16). The word <i>shut</i> in Scripture alludes to lions. How do we know this? We know it from the verse <i>My God hath sent His angels and hath shut the lion’s mouth</i> (Dan. 6:23).",

During the generation of the separation, the sea inundated the world and the descendants of Ham were scattered (as thirty families), as it is said: <i>The Lord scattered them abroad</i> (Gen. 11:8). But now, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: I will cause them to descend from you, as it is said: <i>All the nations of the earth will be blessed through him</i>. He begot the (thirty) families, and these are they: the twelve princes that descended from Ishmael (ibid. 25:12—16), the sixteen offspring from his wife Keturah (ibid., vv. 1—4), and the two nations in the womb of Rebecca (ibid., v. 23). Hence Scripture says: <i>All the nations of the earth will be blessed through him</i>.",

There were some men who whispered among themselves: “It is impossible that this centenarian and this woman of ninety gave birth to a son. This cannot be her offspring, she must have purchased him in the marketplace.” Hence, you find that when Isaac was weaned, Abraham arranged a banquet to which he invited the influential men of the government, while Sarah invited their wives. What did the women do? They said to each other: “Now we shall be able to prove whether or not he is actually her son.” Each of them brought her own son along but neglected to bring the child’s nurse. Soon, the children began to cry and the mothers exclaimed: “I have forgotten to bring the child’s nurse.” Whereupon, milk began to flow from Sarah’s breast, and she took the children and nursed them, as it is said: <i>That Sarah should give children suck</i> (Gen. 21:7).

He replied: Even our patriarch Jacob sought no more than that from the Holy One, blessed be He: <i>If God will but give me food to eat and raiment to wear</i> (Gen. 28:20). Our sages stated: The proselyte is so dearly beloved that the Holy One, blessed be He, emphasized his importance through the words of the prophet, as it is said: <i>Why shouldst thou be as a stranger in the land?</i> (Jer. 14:8). The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: I love the proselyte, and these wicked men are conspiring to attack Abraham, the father of all proselytes. Woe unto them, for they are doomed to succumb before him, as it is written in Scripture: <i>And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel.</i> Why was he called Amraphel?

This verse alludes to Abraham, who mourned for Sarah, for it was written previously: <i>And Sarah died</i> (Gen. 23:2). Abraham began to weep for her, saying: <i>A woman of valor who can find? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her</i> (Prov. 31:10). When did he demonstrate his trust in her? When he said to her: <i>Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister</i> (Gen. 12:13). <i>She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life</i> (Prov. 31:12). <i>She seeketh between wool and flax</i> (ibid., v. 13) alludes to her decision to separate Isaac and Ishmael when she said to her husband: <i>Cast out this bondwoman and her son</i> (Gen. 21:10). <i>She is like the merchant ships</i> (Prov. 31:14); <i>For the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house</i> (Gen. 12:15), and later Abimelech sent her away. <i>She riseth also while it is yet night</i> (Prov. 31:15). When did that happen? <i>At the time Abraham arose early in the morning</i> (Gen. 22:3). <i>She considereth a field and buyeth it</i> (Prov. 31:16). She thought about the field of Machpelah and acquired it. Ultimately she was buried there, as it is said: <i>And after this, Abraham buried Sarah, his wife</i> (Gen. 23:19). <i>She girdeth her loins with strength</i> (for the birth of Isaac) (Prov. 31:17).

That saith of Jerusalem: “She shall be inhabited”; and of the cities of Judah: “They shall be built”</i> (Isa. 44:26). <i>That confirmeth the word of His servant</i> refers to Abraham, for the Holy One, blessed be He, said: I opened his womb (Abimelech) on account of Abraham, My servant, who prayed in his behalf, as it is said: <i>And Abraham prayed unto God</i> (Gen. 20:17). <i>Performeth the counsel of His messengers</i> alludes to the angels who informed Abraham that he would have an offspring, as it is said: <i>I will certainly return unto you when the season cometh around</i> (ibid. 18:10).", 
        "5_Vayera, 7_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And the two angels came to Sodom at evening (Gen. 19:1).</b> What is written before this verse? <i>And Abraham drew near and said, “Wilt Thou sweep away the righteous with the wicked?”</i> (Gen. 18:23). R. Phinehas the priest, the son of Hama, stated: Certainly the Holy One, blessed be He, does not desire to find any of His creatures guilty, for it is said: <i>I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth</i> (Ezek. 18:32). Furthermore it says: <i>For Thou are not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness</i> (Ps. 5:4); and: <i>As I live, saith the Lord Eternal, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</i> (Ezek. 33:11). What does the Holy One, blessed be He, take pleasure in doing? In proving the righteousness of His creatures, as it is said: <i>The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake</i> (Isa. 42:21). Proof of this is that even when mankind sins against the Holy One, blessed be He, and provokes him to anger, He relents and seeks an advocate to plead in their behalf. In fact, He suggests the arguments the advocate can employ. Hence, you find that at the time of Jeremiah, He proclaimed: <i>Run ye, to and fro, through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man. If there be any who doeth justly, that seeketh truth, and I will pardon her</i> (Jer. 5:1).", 
        "19_Mishpatim, 16_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "<i>And give thee a pleasant land</i> (Jer. 3:19). It was a land greatly coveted by all the mighty men of the world. Abraham said of it: <i>Give me a possession of a burying-place with you</i> (Gen. 23:4). Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, made it precious to Isaac, as it is said: <i>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee and will bless thee</i> (ibid. 26:3). And Jacob said: <i>In my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me</i> (ibid. 50:5). Hence it says: <i>And give thee a pleasant land, the goodliest heritage of the deer</i> (Jer. 3:19). What is indicated by the use of the word <i>deer</i>? Just as the flesh of a deer cannot be restored into its skin when they attempt to recover it after it has been slaughtered and its skin has been stripped away, so the land of Israel is not able to contain its fruit (when it is worthy). A proof of this is written in the verse: <i>The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan</i> (Isa. 30:24). At first they winnowed the grain with a shovel, but later they winnowed it with a fan. Why? because the grain was more plentiful than the straw, though the grain grows within the straw. Whence do we know this was so? For it is written: <i>Shall eat savory provender</i>. The savory provender was the fruit (of the straw). Hence, <i>And give thee a pleasant land, the goodliest heritage of the deer</i> indicates that like the deer the land of Israel could not contain its fruits.",

(They responded positively even before they knew God’s commands.) R. Isaac the smith said: Those who observe the Sabbatical year are <i>ye mighty in strength.</i> Why? Because they control their evil inclinations when their fields are open and available to those who would pick their crops from the corner of this field or during the Sabbatical year. Finally, the homilist informs us that Moses was mighty in strength, for he alone heard <i>the voice of His word</i> when God called unto him. <i>Ye mighty in strength,</i> the midrash is teaching us, are those who <i>fulfill His word.</i>",

The creatures of the earth saw him and feared him. They believed that he was their creator. They came and bowed down before him, and he said to them: “Why do you come to bow before me?” “All of us have come because we have seen all the creatures that the Holy One, blessed be he, has created.” And his heart was filled with wonder.

If you had been thirteen years old, you could not have tolerated the anguish that accompanies circumcision. Isaac retorted: That is not so!

Idolatry is coupled with falsehood, as it is said: <i>His molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them</i> (Jer. 10:14). <i>But he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward</i> alludes to Abraham, who sowed righteousness by feeding passers-by and travelers, as it is said: <i>And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called thereupon the name of the Lord, the everlasting God</i> (Gen. 21:33).",

He waits until they have died, as it is said: <i>As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all My delight</i> (Ps. 16:3). When are men regarded as truly holy? Only after they have been buried in the earth. During their lifetimes, however, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not associate His name with theirs. And why not? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, is not certain whether or not the evil inclination within them will ultimately lead them astray. When they are dead, however, He does couple His name with theirs. Nevertheless, we find that the Holy One, blessed be he, did couple his name with that of the righteous Isaac during his lifetime, when he said to Jacob: <i>I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Isaac</i> (Gen. 28:43). R. Berechiah and the rabbis discussed this matter. The rabbis maintained that He considered Isaac’s ashes as though they were heaped upon the altar,<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even though the sacrifice of Isaac was not completed, the Akedah was proof that Isaac would never succumb to the evil inclination.</i> while R. Berechiah insisted that he was considered as dead because he had already lost his sight.

What is the meaning of <i>Great things past finding out</i>? It refers to the great deeds the Holy One, blessed be He, did in the formation of the embryo. At the time that a man is about to have intercourse with his wife, the Holy One, blessed be He, informs the angel in charge of conception, whose name is Lailah.<sup>8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lailah’s role is described in Niddah 16b and Sanhedrin 6a.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, says to her: Know that on this night a person will be formed from the semen of a certain individual known to you.

She took it into her hand and brought it at once to Him who had said <i>It hath been already</i> (Eccles. 1:10) and said to Him: “I have done all that You have commanded. Here is the drop, what have You decreed concerning it?” The Holy One, blessed be He, forthwith decreed concerning the semen what its end would be, whether male or female, weak or strong, poor or rich, short or tall, ugly or handsome, heavy or thin, humble or haughty.

You find this occurred at the time Elijah visited the widow in Zarephath. After her son’s death, he began to plead: <i>O Lord my God, hast Thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourned, by slaying her son</i>? (I Kings 17:20).

        "14_Shemot, 23_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel (Exod. 4:29).</b> He told them: The Holy One, blessed be He, has said: <i>I have surely remembered you</i> (Exod. 3:16). This was a sign that was transmitted to them from the days of Abraham and Isaac. Jacob had transmitted it to Joseph when he told him: “Every redeemer who comes and says to you <i>I have surely remembered</i> is a truthful redeemer.” And when Moses came and said <i>I have surely remembered</i>, the people believed him forthwith. Moses and Aaron said to them: “Come with us and we will go unto Pharaoh.” At first the elders of Israel accompanied them, but later they slipped away singly, and then in pairs. When they arrived at Pharaoh’s palace, not a single person who had accompanied them, could be found, as it is written: <i>And afterwards Moses and Aaron came</i> (Exod. 5:1).", 
        "7_Toldot, 7_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And it came to pass that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim (Gen. 27:1).</b> Scripture states elsewhere: <i>A gift</i> (bribe) <i>is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it; whithersoever he turneth, he prospereth</i> (Prov. 17:8). What may the gift (mentioned in this verse) be compared to? To a precious stone which shatters whenever it falls.<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The gift becomes a bribe and ultimately brings harm to the recipient.</i> This verse aptly refers to Isaac, for it is said: <i>Now Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison</i> (lit. <i>the game was in his mouth</i>) (Gen. 25:28). What is the meaning of <i>the game was in his mouth</i>? It means that Esau ensnared<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A play on words: <i>tzayid</i> (venison) and <i>tzud</i> (trap)</i> the righteous Isaac with the words he spoke. You find that Esau committed every sin which the Holy One, blessed be He, detests; <i>There are six things which the Lord hateth, yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood; a heart that deviseth wicked thoughts, feet that are swift in running to evil; a false witness that breatheth out lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren</i> (Prov. 6:16–19). Whenever Esau entered the house, he would ask his father: “My father, is one obliged to tithe for salt?” Isaac would exclaim in amazement: “Observe, how scrupulous this son of mine is concerning the commandments!” And when his father would ask him: “Where were you today, my son?” “At the house of study,” the youth would reply and he would add: “Is this not the law under certain circumstances; are not these things prohibited and these permitted?” By such remarks, he entraped his father with his mouth. That is why he loved him. Thereupon, the Holy Spirit exclaimed: <i>When he speaketh fair believe him not; for there are seven abominations in his heart</i> (ibid. 26:25). Why did Isaac’s eyes become weak? They became weak because he beheld the countenance of the wicked Esau; also because he ate the venison he brought him, as it is said: <i>For the gift blinded them that hath sight</i> (Exod. 23:8).", 
        "7_Toldot, 3_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac (Gen. 25:9).</b> Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: <i>Children’s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers</i> (Prov. 17:6). The righteous are “regaled” (i.e. saved) by their grandchildren, and their children are regaled by their fathers. How do we know this? We know it because Abraham was saved for Jacob’s sake. After Nimrod caused Abraham to be hurled into the fiery furnace, the Holy One, blessed be He, descended to rescue him. The ministering angels thereupon exclaimed: Master of the Universe, why do You trouble to save him, since so many wicked men will descend from him? The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: I shall save him for the sake of his grandson Jacob, who will descend from him. Whence do we know this to be so? R. Berechiah said: It is written: <i>Thus saith the Lord who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob</i> (Isa. 29:22); that is, He redeemed him from the furnace for the sake of Jacob. Hence, fathers are saved for the sake of their descendants.",

That is, they assembled on that day and decreed that the thirteenth day of Adar should be a fast-day, However, they designated the fourteenth day of Adar as a festive day, as it is written: <i>And on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness</i> (ibid., v. 17).",

David said concerning him: <i>Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that art enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth</i> (Ps. 80:1). When a famine occurred during the lifetime of David, he pleaded to the Holy One, blessed be He, for mercy, saying: “Master of the Universe, tend your flock as did Joseph, who fed the world through years of famine.”",

One who takes interest is actually saying to the Holy One, blessed be He: Do You not take payment from Your world in which Your creatures reside? Payment from the earth which You water, from the flowers which You cause to grow, from the light You make shine, from the soul which You breathe (into us), from the body which You protect? The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: See how much I have loaned, yet I do not take interest, and see how much the earth has loaned you for which it does not take interest. I take only the principal which I have loaned, and the earth takes back only her principal, as it is said: <i>And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth unto God who gave it</i> (Eccles. 12:7).",

He remembered Lot and rescued him because of the merit of Abraham, as is said: <i>And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow</i> (Gen. 19:29). In the Mishnah it was said that one should save the Sefer Torah case as well as the Sefer Torah, and the tefillin case as well as the tefillin. It teaches us: Happy are the righteous and those who cling to them. Scripture states: <i>And God remembered Noah and every living thing and all the cattle</i> (ibid. 8:1), all because of the merit of Noah. Similarly, <i>God remembered Abraham and sent out Lot</i> (ibid. 19:29). Woe to the wicked and to those who cling to them, as it is said: <i>And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle</i> (ibid. 7:23). Furthermore, it states: <i>I will blot out man whom I have created</i> (ibid. 6:7). The angels of destruction came as the emissaries of the Holy One, blessed be He, in order to destroy Sodom.",

What is meant by <i>a great voice, and it went on no more</i>? Our sages said: The entire Ten Commandments came forth from the mouth of the Mighty One in sound. This was an extremely difficult procedure. No ordinary individual is able to speak in that fashion nor is any human ear able to endure such a sound. Therefore it is written: <i>My soul failed me when he spoke</i> (Song 5:6). <i>With a great voice, and it went on no more</i>.

Eleazar of Modi’im insisted: It was an olive tree. R. Joshua the son of Karha maintained that it was a cedar tree. Others said that it was the root of a fig tree and the root of a pomegranate tree. In any case, it was extremely bitter. R. Simeon the son of Gamliel said: Come and observe how different the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He, are from the ways of man. Man improves the taste of a bitter thing with something sweet, but the Holy One, blessed be He, improves the taste of a bitter thing by adding something bitter. How does He do that? He places something that causes damage into a thing that is damaged and thereby performs a miracle. For example, And Isaiah said: <i>Let them take a cake of figs and lay it for a plaster on the boil, and he shall recover</i> (Isa. 38:21). Is it not a fact that if you place a cake of figs on a raw piece of flesh, the flesh will decay immediately? This verse illustrates that He places a thing that injures upon something that was injured in order to perform a miracle. Similarly, <i>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast salt therein, and said: “Thus saith the Lord: I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence anymore death or miscarrying”</i> (II Kings 2:21). Is it not a fact that sweet water into which you put salt water is spoiled immediately? But here He placed a thing that is distasteful into something that was distasteful, and thus performed a miracle thereby. The Holy One, blessed be He, declared unto Moses: Is it not a fact that I am a unique craftsman? Do I not heal with what I wound? If these waters are bitter, I will make them palatable by adding something that is bitter.",

The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Since I must not profane My divine glory by entering the home of the wicked Laban, what shall I do? At the very moment he leaves him, I shall fulfill My promise and be with him. Jacob reflected upon this, saying to himself: Did He not promise me <i>I shall not forsake thee</i> (ibid.)? Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, replied: If you desire that I be with you, then depart from Laban’s house and <i>Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee</i> (ibid. 31:13).", 
        "17_Beshalach, 5_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Similarly, in the verse <i>And he blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle</i> (Gen. 7:3). He mentioned man first, because man was the first to sin, and after that he refers to beasts and creeping things. Likewise, since Scripture states: <i>And they smote the men that were at the door with blindness, both small and great</i> (ibid. 19:11), they smote the least important ones first and then the greater ones. Likewise, in accordance with the verse <i>I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast</i>, man was punished first and then the beast. Another illustration is in the verse <i>Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword</i> (Deut. 13:16). He smote the inhabitants of the city with the sword, and then he slew the cattle. Similarly, <i>And her belly shall swell</i> (Num. 5:27) is followed by <i>And her thighs shall fall away</i>. That is, the part of the body that sinned first was punished first. Is it not logical to conclude that if retribution is exacted first from the one who commits an evil deed first, then the reward for good deeds, whose reward is far greater, is dispensed according to the same rule.",

A good name adheres to the living and the dead, while precious oil exists for the living alone. The scent of precious oil may travel from the sleeping chamber to the anteroom, but a good name travels from one end of the earth to the other. When precious oil falls upon a corpse, it become putrid, as it is said: <i>Dead flies make the oil of a perfumer fetid and putrid</i> (Eccles. 10:1), but when a good name is possessed by a deceased person, it does not deteriorate, as is said: <i>And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, and he stretched himself out upon him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm</i> (II Kings 4:34). Another explanation. When precious oil falls into water it floats away, but a good name does not float away, as is said: <i>And the Lord spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land</i> (Jonah 2:11). Another explanation. When precious oil falls into a fire, it is consumed, but when a good name falls into fire, it is not consumed, as is said: <i>Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire</i> (Dan. 3:26).",

Thus you learn that faith is powerful, for in reward for faith, the Shekhinah hovered over them and they sang the song, as it is said: <i>And they believed in the Lord … and Moses sang</i> (Exod. 14:31–15:1), and it says also: <i>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise</i> (Ps. 106:12).",

Therefore women are exempt from so doing, for they do not devote themselves to the law. It may be possible to conclude that the law of phylacteries applies to children. Therefore Scripture says: <i>And Thou shalt keep it;</i> and that applies to all who are diligent in the study of the Torah and in the performance of good deeds. Hence a child is exempt. But if a child is a Bar Mitzvah or well informed, he must fulfill the law. It is possible that one may neglect to examine the phylacteries, and so Scripture says: <i>from year to year</i>. From this statement they conclude that a man should examine his phylacteries at least once every twelve months. <i>From year to year</i> is mentioned in this verse, and further on <i>For a full year shall he have the right of redemption</i> (Lev. 25:29) is stated. Just as in the former case a year means twelve months, so also in the latter instance a year implies twelve months. This is the opinion of the School of Hillel.

Does it not say: <i>Ephraim and Manasseh shall be like Reuben and Simeon</i> (Gen. 48:5), making fourteen in all? The answer is that when Levi is counted among the tribes, they are not counted, and when Levi is not counted among the tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh are reckoned as one tribe. How do we know this It is written: <i>Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim, Elishama the son of Manasseh … Gamaliel</i> (Num. 1:10).

He said to him: Even though the wooden casket is to be inserted between them, handle it with the utmost care. Why? Because the Torah, the tablets, and even the broken tablets will be placed within it. Hence treat it with honor, since it is said: <i>Thou shalt put them in the ark</i> (Deut. 10:2); that is, both the (second) tablets and the broken tablets shall be placed inside it. <i>And thou shalt put them in the ark</i>. That is to say, even if you should see students of the Torah who are poor and unfortunate, treat them with respect, for the law is stored within them. <i>And make a crown of gold</i> (Exod. 37:2). Why? Because the Torah rests therein. There are three crowns, the crown of the Torah, the crown of priesthood, (and) the crown of kingship, but there is an additional crown, the crown of a good name, that excels them all. How do we know abut the crown of the Torah? It is said: <i>That wisdom preserveth the life of him who has it</i> (Exod. 7:12) both in this world and the world-to-come. Hence it is written: <i>And made a crown of gold</i>.",

After all, a powerful man is jealous only of another powerful man, a wise man of another wise man, a rich man of another rich man, etc. This subject is discussed in the chapter entitled Rabbi Ishmael in Tractate Avodah Zarah.<sup>19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avodah Zarah, chap. 4.</i>", 
        "21_Tetzaveh, 8_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "However, we find that he did not live the same number of years as Moses, our teacher. It is written about Moses: <i>And Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died</i> (Deut. 34:7), while Joshua passed away at the age of one hundred and ten years. Why did he live ten years less? Because he spoke ten words before Moses, his master, spoke, as it is said: <i>And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth up, answered and said: “My lord Moses, shut them in”</i> (Num. 11:28). That is why He shortened his life ten years. From this verse you learn that no pupil is permitted to speak before his master, and that anyone who teaches anything before his master does, or even if he does not teach but simply tells others what the law is before his master has stated it, will find his life’s span shortened. Another explanation of the verse <i>The wise shall inherit honor</i>. This alludes to Aaron and his sons, through whom the priesthood was established.",

Similarly, because Hezekiah prayed, the decree against him was abrogated.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hezekiah averted a decree of death for his failure to marry and beget children by reciting prayers (see II Kings 20:1–7, Isa. 38:1–8).</i> And Jacob also prayed for his sons when he sent them to Egypt, as it is said:; <i>And God Almighty give you mercy</i> (Gen. 43:14).",

To teach us that prior to the selection of the land of Israel, all lands merited the revelation of the Holy One, blessed be He, but that after the land of Israel was selected, all other lands were disqualified. Similarly, before Jerusalem was chosen, the entire territory of Israel merited the revelation of the Divine Word, but after Jerusalem was selected, the Divine Word forsook the remainder of the land. Likewise, before the Temple was designated, the city of Jerusalem was considered suitable for the words of the Shekhinah, but after the establishment of the Temple, it removed itself from the rest of Jerusalem, as it is written: <i>For the Lord hath chosen Zion, He hath desired it for His habitation</i> (Ps. 132:13). And it says also: <i>That is My resting place forever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it</i> (ibid., v. 14). Prior to the selection of Aaron, every Israelite merited priesthood, as it is said: <i>It is an everlasting covenant of salt</i> (Num. 18:19), but after he was selected the other Israelites were deemed unfit for priesthood, as it is said: <i>And it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood</i> (ibid. 25:13). Before David was chosen, all Israelites were eligible for kingship, but after the selection of David, all Israelites lost the right of kingship, as it is said: <i>Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord, the God of Israel</i> (Ezra 4:3).",

R. Joshua the son of Levi stated: Abraham established the morning prayer, as it is said: <i>And Abraham arose early in the morning</i> (Gen. 22:3); Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is said: <i>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide</i> (ibid. 24:63); and Jacob introduced the evening prayer, as it is said: <i>And he lighted upon the place and tarried there all night because the sun was setting</i> (ibid. 28:1).",

When the Holy One, blessed be He, benefits a person, His praises are proclaimed: “Blessed is the good and He who does good,” and when evil befalls a person, His praises are also proclaimed: “Blessed be the truthful judge.” Hence, <i>Thou art on high for evermore</i>. Similarly David said: <i>I will lift up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord. I found trouble and sorrow, but I called upon the name of the Lord</i> (Ps. 116:3–4). And likewise, <i>In God</i>—<i>I will praise His word</i>—<i>In the Lord</i>—<i>I will praise His word</i> (Ps. 56:11).

The Holy One, blessed be He, upon observing that Abraham pleaded for the sinners of Sodom, so that the world might not be destroyed, began to praise him, saying: <i>Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured on thy lips; therefore, God hath blessed thee forever</i> (Ps. 45:3). Then Abraham asked, “Where am I fairer than the children of man? When I and my son enter a city, no one is capable of distinguishing between us.” (In those days) a man would live to be a hundred or two hundred years old without acquiring the distinguishing features of old age. “It is imperative, Master of the Universe, that You should distinguish between father and son, between old and young, so that the young may pay homage to the old.” The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: “Be assured I will begin to distinguish between young and old with you.” Abraham went to sleep, and when he arose in the morning he found that the hair of his head and beard had turned white. “Master of the Universe,” he exclaimed, “You have made me a public spectacle.” The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: <i>Thy hoary head is a crown of glory</i> (Prov. 16:31), and it says elsewhere: <i>And the beauty of men is the hoary head</i> (ibid. 20:29).

With reference to the first tablets, it is written: <i>And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightning</i> (ibid. 19:16). But with regard to the second tablets, it is said: <i>Neither let any man be seen</i> (ibid. 34:3). Because the first tablets were given openly, the evil inclination prevailed over them, and (for that reason) they were broken. But in this instance (the second tablets) the Holy One, blessed be He, said: There is nothing more desirable than humility, as it is said: <i>And what doth the Lord require of thee: only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with the God</i> (Mic. 6:8).", 
        "5_Vayera, 4_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "It is written: <i>So shalt thou find grace and good favor in the sight of God and man</i> (Prov. 3:4). Every person loved by his king is also loved by the king’s courtiers, but if he is loved by the courtiers he is not necessarily loved by the king. The righteous, however, are loved by the Holy One, blessed be He, by the angels, and by all creatures. Whence do we know this to be so? You find that when the angel visited Daniel he called him <i>greatly beloved</i> three times: <i>And he said unto me: Daniel, thou man greatly beloved, give heed unto the words that I speak unto thee</i> (Dan. 10:11); <i>O man, greatly beloved, fear not!</i> (ibid., v. 19); and <i>And I come to declare it, for greatly beloved art thou</i> (ibid. 9:23). Why was he called <i>greatly beloved?</i> Happy indeed is the man who hears an angel calling unto him: <i>O man, greatly beloved,</i> for that man is beloved by the Holy One, blessed be He, extolled by the heavenly bodies, and adored by his generation. Similarly, Bezalel was loved by the Holy One, blessed be He, by those on high, and by those on earth, as is said: <i>See, I have called by name Bezalel</i> (Exod. 31:20), and it is written elsewhere: <i>See, the Lord hath called Bezalel by name</i> (ibid. 35:30). The word <i>see</i> in the latter verse refers to the heavenly beings, and the word <i>see</i> in the former verse alludes to the earthly beings. Hence, Scripture states: <i>So shalt thou find grace and good favor in the sight of God and man</i> (Prov. 3:4).",

These are: the incense, the ark, and the staff. The incense was an instrument of punishment, for it brought distress to Nadab and Abihu. That is why He informed them that incense was to be used for atonement, as is said: <i>And he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people</i> (Num. 17:12). They said that the ark was a tool for retribution, for He killed Uzzah and the men of Beth-shemesh there, as is said: <i>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God</i> (II Sam. 6:7). And it is written elsewhere: <i>And He smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had gazed upon the ark of the Lord, even He smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men; and the people mourned</i> (I Sam. 6:19). But He revealed to them that it was also an instrument of blessing, as is written: <i>And the ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his house</i> (II Sam. 6:11).",

He asked his father’s corpse: “Now that you are dead, why do you behave as a Jew, observing the Sabbath?” He replied: “My son, everyone among you who does not observe the Sabbath as it is decreed will do so unwillingly when he arrives here.” He asked him: “What work do you do on weekdays?

Forthwith, He released them by raising the furnace, which was extremely deep, until it was level with the ground. When the angel beheld what had transpired, he said to them: “Depart from this place, for the Holy One, blessed be He, has already released you. He performed miracles in your behalf and has raised the furnace level with the ground.” They replied: “We shall not depart from this place without the king’s permission lest he say we escaped from the furnace. <i>I keep the king’s command;</i> that is, by his command we were cast into the furnace, and only at his command shall we depart.” When Nebuchadnezzar approached and saw what had taken place he was astounded, and he spoke, saying: <i>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of God Most High, come forth, and come hither</i> (Dan. 3:26). The verse does not say “Come up” but merely <i>Come forth, and come hither,</i> thereby indicating that the furnace had been raised level with the ground. Inasmuch as they had been cast into the furnace at his command, they would <i>come forth</i> only at his command. Where did they learn this? They learned it from Noah, who entered the ark at the command of the Holy Omnipotent One, blessed be He, as it is said: <i>Come, thou and all thy house</i> (Gen. 7:1), and finally he left it at His command when He said to him: <i>Go forth from the ark</i> (ibid. 8:16).",

These four are included also in the phylactery that is placed on the forehead, but they are written on four separate slips of parchment. Whence do we know that four separate slips of parchment are necessary? From the word <i>totafot. Tot</i> is a Coptic word meaning “two”; and <i>fot</i> is an African word meaning “two,” thus making four for the head phylactery, and a total of five parchments in all. How do we know that the arm phylactery contains (only) one (parchment)? Since it is written: <i>And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand</i> (the word <i>your hand</i> is spelled with an extra <i>heh</i>, which has a numerical value of five) and so so there are five (parchments) in all. Hence you learn that the phylactery containing the four verses on separate pieces of parchment is placed upon the head, and the phylactery with the one parchment, containing the same four verses, is placed upon the arm. It might be possible to maintain that the phylactery with the four parchments is placed upon the arm, and so Scripture says: <i>And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand</i>. Where is it placed on the hand? You might maintain that it is placed on the arch of the hand just as it is placed on the arch of the head. Therefore, Scripture says: <i>And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart</i> (Deut. 6:6). From this statement they concluded: One must place the phylactery on the part of the arm opposite the heart. You might contend that the phylacteries are to be put on at night. Hence Scripture says: <i>In its season from day to day</i> (Exod. 13:10), namely, in the daytime and not at night. You might maintain: Perhaps they are to be donned on the Sabbath or the holy days. Therefore Scripture says: <i>From day to day</i>, implying that there are days on which a man dons them and days on which he does not. The days on which he does not don them are the Sabbath and the holy days. You might say: Perhaps he should place the phylacteries on his right hand. Scripture, therefore, says: <i>Upon thy hand</i>, and the word <i>thy hand</i> is used only in reference to the left hand, as it is said: <i>Yea, My hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath spread out the heavens</i> (Isa. 48:13).

Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: <i>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God; for God is in the heavens and thou art upon the earth; therefore, let thy words be few</i> (Eccles. 5:1). It says also: <i>He loveth transgression that loveth strife, he that lifteth his gate seeketh destruction</i> (Prov. 17:19). Should this verse not state that “he who lowereth his gate<sup>27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Thereby placing temptation before others.</i> seeketh destruction,” since everyone who lowers his gate causes people to stumble and to be destroyed: What then is the meaning of <i>he that lifteth his gate seeketh destruction?</i> This means that one who opens his mouth and utters words that are unseemly brings on his own destruction, for the Holy One, blessed be He, will destroy him. Therefore, it is said: <i>Be not rash with thy mouth</i> (Eccles. 5:1).", 
        "16_Bo, 3_Siman, 5_Paragraph": "There was pestilence in Egypt, and about Edom it says: <i>I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood</i> (Ezek. 38:22). In Egypt, boils were inflicted, and in Edom: <i>Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their sockets, and their tongues shall consume away in their mouths</i> (Zech. 14:12). In Egypt there was hail, and upon Edom: <i>An overflowing shower and great hailstones</i> (Ezek. 38:22). Locusts afflicted Egypt, and in the case of Edom: <i>Son of man … Speak unto the birds of every sort, and to every beast of the field: Assemble yourselves</i> (Ezek. 39:17). Darkness befell Egypt, and with regard to Edom: <i>He shall stretch over it the line of confusion and the plummet of emptiness</i> (Isa. 34:11). In Egypt He smote their firstborn, and in Edom: <i>There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians</i> (Ezek. 32:30).", 
        "15_Vaera, 4_Siman, 4_Paragraph": "Lest you believe that Solomon alone was guilty, Moses, our master, likewise concerned himself in many things and was confounded by them. When was that? When he went to Pharaoh, as it is written: <i>And afterwards Moses and Aaron came</i> (Exod. 5:1).<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They came alone. Moses neglected to keep watch over the elders, who slipped away, because of his preoccupation with many matters.</i> R.

His guards went to him and told him: “Two old men are standing at the door.” “Do they hold a crown in their hands?” he asked. “No,” the guard replied. “Then let them enter last,” he declared. When they finally stood before Pharaoh, he said: “What do you desire?” Moses replied: <i>The God of the Hebrews has sent me to you to say: Let My people go that they may serve Me</i> (Exod. 7:16). He retorted angrily: “<i>Who is the Lord, that I should hearken unto His voice?</i> Does He not know enough to send me a crown?

His eye would split open, and the man would fall to the ground and die. R. Aha the son of Rab stated: Their bodies trembled, and they became weak in the presence of the Israelites, who then slew them.

Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, on the other hand, went into the fire and came out alive, as it is said: <i>Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire. And the day of death rather than the day of one’s birth</i> (Exod. 7:1). When a child is born, no one can foresee the vicissitudes that may befall him, but at the time of his death everything about his life is known. When Miriam was born, no one was aware of it, but at her death the well disappeared.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Taanit 4a.

(After their deaths,) everyone knew these things. <i>A good name is better than precious oil</i>. Bezalel’s good name was more helpful to him than anointing oil to the sons of Aaron, for in the case of Bezalel, the Holy One, blessed be He, declared: <i>See, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel</i>.",

Indeed, all you have done was previously known and revealed to Me: your descent into the furnace to sanctify My name; the ten trials you underwent; your pursuit after the kings; and the manner in which you were glorified. Hence, if you desire to make yourself great in this world, <i>Gird thy sword about thy thigh</i> (Ps. 45:4).

        "5_Vayera, 8_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "After they sinned, the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded his angels: “Go, destroy it.” Then they fulfilled their mission, as it is said: <i>And the two angels came to Sodom</i>. Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: <i>He sent forth upon them the fierceness of His anger, wrath, and indignation and trouble</i> (Ps. 78:49). What is meant by <i>the fierceness of His anger</i>? R. Simeon the son of Yohai said: Five plagues resulted from His anger, as it is said: <i>How much more when I send My four judgments against Jerusalem, the sword and the famine and the wild beast and the pestilence</i> (Ezek. 14:21). What is the fifth plague? The drought. How do we know this? R.

        "5_Vayera, 5_Siman, 5_Paragraph": "Another explanation of <i>And the Lord said: Shall I hide from Abraham?:</i> Scripture states elsewhere in reference to this verse: <i>Then he opened the ears of men, and by their chastisement sealeth the decree</i> (Job 33:16). This verse refers to Abimelech and Pharaoh, since the Holy One, blessed be He, opened their ears, as is said: <i>And God came to Abimelech in a dream at night</i> (Gen. 20:3) <i>and the Lord came and plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai</i> (ibid. 12:17). What is meant by the words <i>By their chastisement sealeth the decree</i>? They mean that He afflicted Abimelech by sealing up his organs, as it is said: <i>For the Lord had fast sealed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife</i> (ibid. 20:18). And He punished Pharaoh in the same way. In reference to Abimelech, Scripture states: <i>Because of Sarah</i>. Just as the words <i>because of</i> indicate that Abimelech’s sexual organs were sealed up, so the words <i>because of</i> signify that Pharaoh’s sexual organs were sealed up. Hence, it says: <i>By their chastisement sealeth the decree</i>.",

He replied: It is not as you imagine. <i>This they shall give</i> indicates that they shall give something like this. R. Huna said in the name of Rab: <i>The Almighty, whom we cannot find out, is excellent in power</i> (Job 37:23) implies that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not impose impossible burdens upon Israel.

Aaron told them to do this difficult thing because (he was aware that) the women would not agree to it. They had seen the miracles and the deeds that the Holy One, blessed be He, had wrought for them in Egypt, and what had transpired at the Red Sea and at Sinai, and so they went to the men and said: God forbid that we should renounce the Holy One, blessed be He, who has performed all these miracles and mighty deeds in our behalf, in order to fashion an idol. The men, however, refused to listen to them: <i>And all the people broke off the golden rings which were in their ears</i> (ibid., v. 3).

Thereupon, the Holy Spirit exclaimed: <i>Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?</i> (Lam. 3:37). Pharaoh decreed that the firstborn children should be cast into the river, but the Holy One, blessed be He, did not ordain that.

Rather, He works with them. He reveals to these (the righteous) the essential character of their deeds and to those (the wicked) the essential nature of their acts. How do we know that the punishment of the wicked is called <i>work</i>? It is said: <i>The Lord hath opened His armory and hath brought forth the weapons of His indignation; for it is a work that the Lord God of hosts hath to do</i> (Jer. 50:25). How do we know that rewarding the righteous is considered <i>work</i>?

If the path before a mortal king is muddy, he walks upon stones which are firmly set within it, but the Holy One, blessed be He, abandons the visible clouds and travels upon the invisible winds, as it is said: <i>Who walkest upon the wings of the wind</i>. A mortal king surrounds himself with mighty officers and arms them with weapons and armor, but the officers of the Holy One, blessed be He, are invisible, as it is said: <i>Who makest winds His messengers</i> (ibid., v. 4).

It is written: <i>But with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day</i> (Deut. 29:14). <i>That standeth here with us this day</i> refers to those who were already born, and <i>with him that is not here</i> alludes to those who were to be born in the future. Hence they are <i>not with us this day</i>. “Not standing here with us this day” is not written in this verse, but rather <i>Is not here with us this day</i>. This alludes to the souls who were to be created in the future, since <i>standing here</i> could not be said of them. They were included in the general statement. And that is why the verse states: <i>The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi</i> (Mal. 1:1). It does not say “of Malachi,” but merely <i>by Malachi</i>, indicating that the prophecy had been transmitted to him previously at Sinai. Similarly Isaiah said: <i>Come ye near unto Me, hear ye this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I; and now the Lord hath sent me, and His spirit</i> (Isa. 48:16). Isaiah is saying here that at the time the Torah was given I received the prophecy. Hence it says: <i>from the time that it</i> (the Torah) <i>was, there am I; and now the Lord God hath sent me, and His spirit</i>, but until now He did not give me permission to prophesy.",

In reference to the heaven, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: <i>The heavens are the heavens of the Lord</i> (Ps. 115:16), and in regard to the earth, <i>The earth hath He given to the children of men</i> (ibid.). This may be compared to a king who decreed that the people of Rome should not migrate to Syria and that the people of Syria should not migrate to Rome. And similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, decreed when he created the world: <i>The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; and the earth He hath given to the children of men</i>. However, when He decided to give the Torah, He abrogated the first decrees and declared: Let the earthly beings ascend on high and the heavenly creatures descend below, and I will be the first (to do so), as it is said: <i>And the Lord came down upon Sinai</i> (Exod. 19:20).

This indicates that whenever the Israelites glanced upward and directed their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they were strengthened, but if not, they were defeated. Similarly, <i>And the Lord said unto Moses: “Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live”</i> (Num. 21:8). Can a serpent of bronze cause death or life? This, likewise, indicates that whenever the Israelites looked upwards and expressed their devotion to their Heavenly Father, they were healed, but if not, they were destroyed. Similarly, in the verse <i>And the blood shall be to you for a token</i> (Exod. 12:13), did the blood help the angel of destruction or the Israelites? The fact is that at the time the Israelites smeared blood upon their doorposts, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself and had pity upon them, as it is said: <i>And when I see the blood, I will pass over you</i> (ibid.) i.e., the angel of death will not be permitted to come to your homes to smite you.",

It is written: <i>The Lord by wisdom founded the earth</i> (Prov. 3:19) and also: <i>I have filled him with the spirit of wisdom</i> (Exod. 31:3).

When the Holy One, blessed be He, created His world, He did so just as a child is born to a woman. A child starts to grow at the navel and then develops in all directions, and the Holy One, blessed be He, began the creation of His world at the foundation stone, and built the world upon it. Why was it called a foundation stone? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, began the creation of His world upon it. Then He created the celestial Temple, as it is said: <i>The place, O Lord, which Thou hast made to dwell in</i> (Exod. 15:14). Do not read the word as <i>makom</i> (“foundation”), but as <i>mekuvan</i> (“exactly opposite”). Your dwelling place above is directly opposite Your dwelling place below. The formation of the embryo is like the formation of the world, for just as the embryo is formed in the womb of its mother, so too the world was formed at the foundation stone.",

        "9_Vayishlach, 8_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "What is meant by <i>evil shall not sojourn with Thee</i>? It means that no impure words ever emanate from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it says: <i>The words of the Lord are pure words</i> (Ps. 12:4). You know this to be so from the fact that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Noah: <i>Of every clean beast … and of the beasts that are not clean</i> (Gen. 7:2). Observe that Scripture does not say “unclean beasts” but rather <i>beasts that are not clean</i>. R. Joshua the son of Levi said: The Holy One, blessed be He, resorts to a circumlocution of two and three words in the Torah rather than utter an impure word.<sup>10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse mentions the pure characteristics of the animal even though it may not be eaten.

This is a sign of purity in an animal. Likewise in the case of the pig, He said: <i>The swine, because he parteth the hoof</i> (ibid., v. 7). This too is a sign of purity. Why did He do this? So that He would not be forced to utter an unclean word. Hence, <i>Evil shall not sojourn with Thee</i>.",

Who was this friend? It was Jethro, who welcomed Moses after he fled from Pharaoh. From this you learn that if anyone undertakes to perform a good deed (even if he does not do it), that good deed will never cease recurring in his home. Jethro welcomed into his home a redeemer who had fled from his enemy, and so from his house there descended one who welcomed an enemy who was fleeing from a redeemer and slew him. Who was this enemy? Sisera, as it is said: <i>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite … then Jael took a tent pin</i>, etc. (Judg. 4:17, 21).

Similarly, You set a time limit in which the men of the Tower of Babel were to repent, yet You did not decree their extinction until they performed their most wicked acts, as it is said: <i>And now nothing will be withholden from them</i> (ibid. 11:6).

Ahab married the Phoenician princess Jezebel, who introduced the worship of Baal and Astarte into the northern kingdom. <i>And he went and served Baal and worshipped him</i> (I Kings 16:31).</i> It was for this reason the Holy Spirit departed from him. When Joseph realized this, he prostrated himself before the Holy One, blessed be He, and pleaded for mercy, saying: “Master of the Universe, if they are worthy to be blessed, do not turn away and cause me to be turned away today disgraced.” Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, restored the Holy Spirit to Jacob, and he blessed them. Whence do we know this? From the fact that it is written: <i>And I, I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms</i> (Hos. 11:3), that is, I restored the Holy Spirit to Jacob for the sake of Ephraim.", 
        "17_Beshalach, 17_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "It is related that while King Shapur (of Persia) was passing through that place with the members of his family, a serpent swallowed one of them. As he continued along, a second member of his family was swallowed up and then a third. King Shapur was deeply saddened, but he did not know what to do. His counselors advised him: “Summon ten mighty men to fill the place with a layer of straw.” He summoned them and they did so. They placed straw around the serpent, and he swallowed it. Then they placed more straw around him, and he swallowed it as well. This continued until his belly swelled up, and they killed him. Hence, <i>Who led thee through the great and dreadful wilderness, wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint</i> (Deut. 8:15). It says also: <i>The burden of the beasts of the south. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and the flying serpent</i> (Isa. 30:6). The word <i>ef’eh</i> is employed with reference to a viper. They say that when a viper looks at the shadow of a bird flying through the air, the bird immediately becomes entranced and falls apart. Nevertheless, they did not say: <i>Where is the Lord that brought us out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death</i> (Jer. 2:6).

Soon thereafter, one hundred and eighty thousand Samaritans attacked them. Were they actually Samaritans? Indeed not.

Who are these angels? They are the beings who will protect him from demons, as it is said: <i>A thousand may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand</i> (ibid., v. 7).

Ada the son of Hiyya.</i> said: He was called Lahad because the lowliest (<i>hadal</i>) of the tribes was associated (in the building of the Tabernacle) with him. <i>He was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan</i>. R. Hanina the son of Pazzi said: No tribe was greater than Judah, and none was more lowly than Dan, which descended from one of the maidservants, as it says: <i>And the sons of Dan: Hushim</i> (Gen. 46:23). The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: Let him come and join with Judah so that no tribe might become arrogant, for both the great and the lowly are equal in the sight of the Holy One, blessed be He. R. Hanina maintained: No man should become arrogant because of the honors bestowed upon him. The Tabernacle and the Sanctuary were erected by these two tribes, for Solomon was of the tribe of Judah, and Hiram was of the tribe of Dan, as it is said: <i>The son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali</i> (I Kings 7:4), and in the Book of Chronicles: <i>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan</i> (II Chron. 2:12). These verses indicate that his father was of the tribe of Naphtali and his mother of the tribe of Dan. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: In this world you erected a Tabernacle and a Sanctuary which were walled about, but in the world-to-come I will build a Sanctuary that will be encircled by a wall of fire, as it is said: <i>For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire</i> (Zech. 2:9).", 
        "22_Ki Tisa, 18_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "R. Jeremiah maintained that when they brought their earrings to him, Aaron raised his eyes heavenward and declared: <i>Unto Thee I lift mine eyes, O thou that art enthroned in the heavens</i> (Ps. 123:1). You who know all thoughts are aware that I do this unwillingly. He tossed their earrings into the fire, and the magicians approached and performed magical feats. Some say that Micah ground the bricks that Moses had saved into the mixture, and that he took the tablet which Moses had written upon when he raised Joseph’s coffin out of the Nile and cast them into the smelting furnace amidst the earrings. Then the calf came forth leaping. As it leaped about, the people began to cry out: <i>This is thy god, O Israel</i>. The guardian angels then began to proclaim: <i>They forgot God, their savior, who had done great things in Egypt</i> (Ps. 106:21).", 
        "6_Chayei Sara, 7_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Our sages, however, maintained that she was actually a different wife. Rabbi insisted: Hagar and Keturah were one and the same person, since it is written about Isaac: <i>And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi</i> (Gen. 24:62); that is, from the well of which it is written: <i>And she called the name of the Lord that spoke to her, Thou art a God of seeing</i> (ibid. 16:13).

And it says elsewhere: <i>And ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him</i> (Dan. 7:10). <i>Above Him stood the seraphim</i> (Isa. 6:2); and: <i>I came near unto one of them that stood by</i> (Dan. 7:16).",

R. Levi discussed the words <i>Tabernacle of testimony</i>. It is written elsewhere: <i>For the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped</i> (Ps. 63:12), that is to say, the mouths of the peoples of the world, who say to Israel that the Shekhinah will never return to Israel, should be stopped, as it is said: <i>Many there are that say of My soul: “There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah</i> (Ps. 3:3). Before they built the golden calf, the Holy One, blessed be He, dwelt among them, but when He became angry at them they would say: “He will never return to them.” What did He do? He said: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary that I may dwell among them</i> (Exod. 25:8). Then all the inhabitants of the world will know that I have pardoned Israel. Therefore it is written; <i>The Tabernacle of the testimony.

        "4_Lech Lecha, 1_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred (Gen. 12:9).</b> R. Berechiah opened the discussion with the verse: <i>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? If she be a wall, we will build upon her a turret of silver; and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar</i> (Song 8:8–9). To whom does Scripture refer in this verse? It refers to Abraham at the time when Nimrod ordered that he be hurled into the fiery furnace. He was <i>little</i> because the Holy One, blessed be He, had not yet performed any miracles in his behalf. By why was he called “sister” (<i>ahot</i>)? Because he united (<i>iha</i>) all mankind (into a single brotherhood) before God,<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Abraham’s mission was to teach the Oneness of God and the oneness of mankind.</i> just as one who tears a garment apart and then sews it together.

        "16_Bo, 9_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "<i>And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the Passover to the Lord</i> (ibid., v. 48). Does this mean that a stranger who is converted should offer a paschal sacrifice at the first opportunity? Yes, for Scripture says: <i>And he shall be as one that is born in the land</i> (ibid.). Therefore, just as one born in the land offers his sacrifice on the fourteenth day, so the proselyte should do so on the fourteenth day. If he is converted, however, between the two Passovers,<sup>11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">That is, between the fifteenth day of Nisan and the fourteenth day of Iyar, the second Passover (Num. 19:10).</i> he should offer the sacrifice on the second Passover. <i>Let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it</i> (ibid.). This refers to the circumcision of free males and the circumcision of slaves, (the absence of which) prevents him (from offering the paschal sacrifice). If one wishes to perform the two rituals, the commandment of circumcision and the commandment of the paschal lamb, which takes precedence? <i>Let all his males be circumcised</i> is stated first, and that is followed by <i>And let him come near and keep it. One law shall be to him that is home-born</i> (ibid., v. 49). This verse declares that the home-born and the convert are equal with regard to all the commandments inscribed in the Torah.", 
        "14_Shemot, 0_Siman, 9_Paragraph": "Similarly, the verse <i>And he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes</i> alludes to Jacob. His father, Isaac, taught him the law and reprimanded him (as he studied) in the schoolroom, as it is said: <i>And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents</i> (ibid., v. 27). After he had absorbed everything his father could teach him, he left his father’s home to live in Eber’s home, where he continued to study the law.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Megillah 17a. He remained there fourteen years.</i> Therefore, he deserved to inherit the land of Israel, as it is written: <i>And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father’s sojourning</i> (ibid. 37:1). Our patriarch Jacob also punished and rebuked his sons, and taught them his customs and practices lest blemishes should appear in their character. Whence do we know this? From the fact that Scripture states: <i>And these are the names of the sons of Israel: Reuben, Simeon</i>, etc. (ibid. 25:13). Scripture equates them all.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">All of them are mentioned in the same verse.</i> Hence, <i>he that loveth his son chasteneth him betimes</i>.", 
        "16_Bo, 4_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "Why did He speak to the prophets outside the land of Israel? Because of the merit of the patriarchs, as it is stated: <i>A voice is heard in Ramah</i> (Jer. 31:15). And after that it is written: <i>Thus saith the Lord: “Refrain thy voice from weeping”</i> (ibid., v. 16). Even outside the land (however), He spoke to the prophets only in places that were ritually clean, as in the case of Daniel: <i>As I was by the side of the great river, which is Tigris</i> (Dan. 10:4), and also: <i>And I was by the stream Ulai</i> (ibid. 8:3).<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rivers offered the opportunity to obtain ritual cleanliness.</i> Ezekiel said to Him: <i>As I was among the captives by the river Chebar</i> (Ezek. 1:1). This was the Tigris. When did He speak to him?

        "13_Vayechi, 2_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "Why were the patriarchs anxious to be buried in the land of Israel? R. Eliezer said: There is a reason for this. R. Hanina said: There is a reason for this; and R. Joshua the son of Levi said: There is a reason for this. What did they mean by “There is a reason for this”? It is written: <i>I shall walk before the Lord in the land of the living</i> (Ps. 116:9). However, our sages said in the name of R. Helbo that there were two reasons why the patriarchs longed to be buried in the land of Israel: The dead in the land of Israel would be the first to be resurrected in the Messianic age, and they would be the first to enjoy the years brought by the Messiah.", 
        "17_Beshalach, 11_Siman, 9_Paragraph": "Rabbi declared: He would cut his hair on the eve of every Sabbath as was customary with princes.

        "17_Beshalach, 9_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "The Israelites sang ten songs because of the ten miracles performed in their behalf. The first was in Egypt, as is said: <i>You shall have a song as in the night when a feast is hallowed</i> (Isa. 30:29). The second was at the Red Sea, as it is said: <i>Then Moses sang</i> (Exod. 15:1). The third was at the well: <i>Then Israel sang this song</i> (Num. 21:16). The fourth took place when Moses said: <i>And it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing</i> (Deut. 31:24). The fifth: <i>Then spoke Joshua to the Lord</i> (Josh. 10:12). The sixth: <i>Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam</i> (Judg. 5:6); the seventh: <i>And David spoke unto the Lord the words of this song</i> (II Sam. 22:1); the eight: <i>A song at the dedication of the House; of David</i> (Ps. 30:1). Did David actually dedicate the House (Temple)? The fact is that Solomon dedicated it, but inasmuch as David had set his heart upon erecting it, the song of dedication was ascribed to him. A similar example is contained in the verse <i>And his sister stood far off</i> (Exod. 2:4). Was she not the sister of both of them? Indeed she was, but inasmuch as she had devoted herself to Moses’ welfare, she is referred to by his name. Another instance of this is contained in the verse <i>And the two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers took</i> (Gen. 34:25). Was she not the sister of each of the tribal ancestors? She was indeed, but because these two had devoted themselves to her welfare, she is mentioned with their names. Another illustration is contained in the verse <i>Cozbi the daughter of the chief of Midian, their sister</i> (Num. 26:18). Was she actually a sister to all of them? (Hardly!) She was called their sister because she was deeply devoted to her people.",

This was to demonstrate to you that He did not require the light supplied by man. Usually, when a human king constructs a bed and a table, he places a lamp on the table at his left side, but in the Temple, the Menorah was placed at the right of the table, as it is said: <i>And thou shalt set the table without the veil, and the candlestick over against the table</i> (Exod. 26:35). This was done to teach you that He does not require your light. It was instituted solely for your sake, so that the world would be illumined in the future, when darkness descends upon the nations of the world, as it is said: <i>For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but upon thee the Lord will arise, and His glory shall be seen upon thee</i> (Isa. 60:2).",

It is not written “over the elders of His people” but <i>with the elders of His people</i>. That is, He will sit with them and judge the heathens. What will He say to them? You have eaten up the vineyard, namely, Israel, as it is said: <i>For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel</i> (Isa. 5:7); <i>The spoil of the poor is in your houses</i> (ibid. 3:14), for it is said: <i>That the Lord hath founded Zion, and in her shall the poor of His people take refuge</i> (ibid. 14:32).",

No creature is able to endure the sound of the voice of even a single angel, as it is said: <i>His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude</i> (Dan. 10:6). How much more, then, is this so of the voice of the Holy One, blessed be He, concerning whom it is written: <i>Do I not fill heaven and earth?</i> (Jer. 23:24).

The verse does not say “perceived the thunder,” but rather <i>the thunderings</i>. R. Johanan explained this as follows: The sound went forth and divided itself, at first, into seven sounds. These sounds in turn became seventy different languages, so that all nations might comprehend (what was being said). When each nation heard His voice in its own language they fainted away, but Israel listened to it and was unharmed.",

Hence, it is apparent that Abraham was concerned with the observance of the law of <i>Increase and multiply.</i> Similarly, Isaac told Jacob: <i>Arise! Go to Padan-aram</i> (Gen. 28:2), to seek a wife proper for him. He did not wish him to be like the men of the generation of the flood, who wallowed in unchastity and indulged in sexual intercourse with species other than their own.

Normally, if a pupil is ill and his master intends to visit him, his fellow students visit him first and the master comes later. In this instance, however, while Abraham still suffered from the circumcision, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to the angels: Let us go visit him.

Similarly, when Hezekiah was sick, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent Isaiah to him and he said: <i>Thus saith the Lord, the God of David, thy father: “I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will heal thee; on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord”</i> (II Kings 20:5). But he replied: <i>What shall be the sign?</i> (ibid., v. 8), and He answered: <i>This shall be the sign unto thee from the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that He hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?</i> (ibid., v. 9). Likewise, Joshua, the high priest, was told: <i>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, … for they are men that are a sign</i> (Zech. 3:8). Since the righteous demanded signs, how much more did the wicked Pharaoh (have the right to do so).

Inasmuch as the primary reason for fasting is to recite penitential prayers, one would be deterred from honoring the Sabbath, and honoring the Sabbath is more important than a thousand fasts. Honoring the Sabbath is a biblical commandment, while fasting is only a rabbinic decree; therefore honoring the Sabbath takes precedence over the fast. Hence the fast is advanced to Thursday, that is, the twelfth day of Adar. When the fourteenth day of Adar falls on Friday, we naturally fast on Thursday, on the thirteenth day.",

Twice I have come to lead Israel, I am he who came in the days of Moses your master, and he rejected me because he did not wish me to accompany him, and now I have come once again. Forthwith Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed down, and said unto him: <i>What saith my lord unto his servant?</i> (ibid., v. 14).

He says to the angel: “Have you not already taken me out of two worlds and brought me into this one?” And the angel responds: “Did I not tell you that you were formed against your will, that you were born against your will, that you would live against your will, and that ultimately you will have to render an accounting before the Holy One, blessed be He, against your will?”",

This may be compared to a slave whose master commands him to wait for him in the market but neglects to tell him where to wait. The slave asks himself: “Perhaps my master meant that I should wait near the basilica, or the bathhouse, or the theater.” When they finally meet, the master slaps him on the face, and says: “I sent you to the gate of the duke’s palace.” Similarly, when the waters heard the decree, <i>Let the waters underneath the heavens gather in one place</i> (Gen. 1:9), they did not know whether (they were to go) to the north or the south. And so, they raced about, as it is said: <i>The mountains rose, the valley sank</i> (Ps. 104:8), until the Holy One, blessed be He, struck them, and declared: I ordered you to assemble at the place of the Leviathan, as is said: <i>There go the ships; there is the leviathan, whom Thou hast formed to sport therein</i> (ibid., v. 26).",

Should I wage war together with all the nations against Israel and exile them, or should I wage war alone against Israel so that the victory might be mine alone?’ They replied: “Israel had a patriarch called Abraham who was given a child when he was one hundred years old, and he offered him as a sacrifice.” He asked them: “Was the sacrifice completed?” “No,” they answered. He replied: “He offered a sacrifice that was not completed and yet He performed miracles for them, how many more miracles would He have performed if the sacrifice had been completed. Now, since I have a firstborn son who will rule in my stead, I shall offer him as a sacrifice, and perhaps a miracle will be performed in my behalf.” Hence it is written: <i>Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall, and there came a great wrath upon Israel</i> (II Kings 3:27–28).",

R. Yosé the Galilean said: From the fact that Scripture states: <i>There shall no leavened bread be eaten</i>, and adds immediately thereafter, <i>this day you shall go forth</i> (ibid., v. 11), you may deduce that the Israelites ate unleavened bread in Egypt on only one day. <i>In the month of Abib</i>.

Jacob said to Laban: <i>Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been on my side, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty</i>, etc. (ibid. 31:42).

Would not the leaders of the thousands and the hundreds go out, and would not the seventy elders and Aaron, the high priest, go out? Indeed, if he went out, would not all Israel go out with him to meet Jethro? Similarly, when Jacob came to live with Joseph, it is written: <i>Joseph made ready his chariot and went out</i>.

No one was to taste any food, <i>but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath; and he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it into the honeycomb</i> (ibid., v. 27). When Saul realized that the Philistines were overpowering the Israelites, he understood that someone had violated the oath. He examined the ephod and discovered that the stone of the tribe of Benjamin had grown dim. He cast lots between himself and his son Jonathan, and the lot indicated that Jonathan was responsible. He grasped his sword to slay him, as it is said: (Saul said:) “<i>God do so and more also; thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.” And the people said unto Saul: “Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?”</i> (ibid., vv. 44–45).",

What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He ordered the angel responsible for the formation of embryos to fashion this embryo in the exact likeness of his father, so that everyone would be forced to acknowledge that he was Abraham’s son. We know that this was so from the verse <i>These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac</i> (Gen. 25:19). Since the verse states <i>Isaac, Abraham’s son</i>, could we not know from those words that Abraham begot Isaac? Why then does Scripture add the words <i>Abraham begot Isaac</i>?

Therefore, he remains a lifelong slave and does not go forth into the world a free man. Why was this curse imposed upon him? Because he was responsible for his father’s degradation.

Why, then, does Scripture state: <i>He that spareth his rod hateth his son?</i> This teaches you that whenever a man fails to chastise his son, that son will ultimately act wickedly, and he will come to despise him. We find this to be so in the case of Ishmael, who behaved fondly toward his father, who failed to chastise him, and he thus went astray.

The Israelites began to complain against Moses, crying out: “The Holy One, blessed be He, did not tell Moses that Bezalel would build the Sanctuary, Moses made that decision by himself because he is related to him; Moses is king, and his brother, Aaron, is the high priest; his sons are officials of the priesthood, Eleazar is chief of the Levites and the sons of Kohath are the bearers of the Tabernacle. Now this one is being given the authority to build the Sanctuary! Moses seeks to elevate him by giving him this great honor.” Moses attempted to explain. He said to them: “I have done nothing on my own; the Holy One, blessed be He, told me what to do.” And he showed them the words: <i>See, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel</i>. He did this to fulfill what is stated: <i>So shalt thou find grace and good favor in the sight of God and man</i> (Prov. 3:4). <i>In the sight of God</i> alludes to Bezalel, as the Holy One, blessed be He, said: <i>See, the Lord hath called by name Bezalel.

Indeed, the Holy One, blessed be He, also revealed Himself unto Abraham while he sat, as it is said: <i>And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door</i> (ibid., v. 1).",

Nehemiah contended that it was a miraculous creature He created for that precise moment, and that it disappeared immediately thereafter from earth. Why is it called <i>orot tahashim</i> (“sealskins,” lit. “skins of <i>tahashim</i>”)? Because the verse states: <i>The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits</i> (Exod. 26:8). What known animal could supply enough skin for a curtain of thirty cubits? It must, indeed, have been a miraculous creation, which disappeared (immediately after it was created).",

However, if the one from whom he stole it has died, he is required to return the stolen property to his heirs before he is considered to have atoned. When a person returns a stolen article to its owner, the owner must forgive the guilty one lest he regret having repented. Our rabbis taught, however, “If a known thief or usurer desires to make restitution, one should not accept it, and if he does accept it, he is devoid of wisdom and piety.”<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the interpretation of this statement, see Rashi, Bava Kama 94b, s.v. “ignorant of the law.”</i> This is the case only if the stolen object is not intact, but if it is intact, one may accept it. R. Yohanan said: This law was taught during the lifetime of Rabbi. It happened once that a man wanted to return some property which he had stolen, but his wife rebuked him, saying: “Fool, if you were to make complete restitution, even the girdle you are wearing would no longer belong to you.” He changed his mind and did not make restitution. It was then that the sages declared: If a known thief or usurer desires to make restitution, one should not accept it, but if one does accept it, he is devoid of wisdom and piety.”",

He replied: Moses, it is not as you think. You need offer unto Me but one lamb in the morning and not two, for they are not meant to be food and drink for Me. If I had food and drink when you were with Me on the mountain for forty days, would I not have eaten, and if I had food would you not have eaten? <i>Only for a sweet savor, shall ye observe to offer unto Me</i> (Num. 28:2).",

Do not examine his field or vineyard or house, do not press him and say to him: “Borrow ten thousand denarii for your business and give me only the mortgage on your field, or vineyard, or house.” He may eventually suffer a loss in business, and then you will be depriving him of his vineyard.

Thereupon, he replied: “The Holy One, blessed be He, is King, and I am king, and it is fitting indeed for a terrestrial king to serve a Celestial King by burning incense before Him.” <i>He went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense.

Immediately, <i>Uzziah was wroth; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy broke out in his forehead</i> (ibid., v. 19).

The Holy One, blessed be He, instilled wisdom, as it is said: <i>In whom (bahemah) the Lord hath put wisdom and understanding</i> (ibid. 36:1). “In whom,” which may be understood as <i>behemah</i> (“animal”), indicates that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave wisdom to man and beasts but only Bezalel was designated by name.",

Joshua told them: <i>And the city shall be devoted, even it and all that is therein</i> (Josh. 6:17). You find here that it was not the people but Joshua who issued this decree. But how do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, approved it? Because it is written: <i>Israel hath sinned, yea, they have even transgressed My covenant</i> (ibid. 7:11). Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, must have agreed with him. And thus it is written: <i>I will cry unto God Most High; unto God that accomplisheth it for me</i> (Ps. 47:3).",

Judah the Levite said: Whenever a man dies childless, he grieves and weeps. Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, consoles him with the words: “Wherefore do you weep over having left no fruit in this world? You have left fruit that is more desirable than children.” “Sovereign of the universe,” the man asks, “what fruit did I produce?” The Holy One, blessed be He, replies: “The Torah (you observed), concerning which it is written: <i>the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life</i>.” The verse does not say that children are a tree of life but that <i>the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.</i><sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Torah is called a tree of life.

But more important than all the virtues you possess is the fact that you have restrained yourself from acting as a judge and have refrained from the overseeing the needs of the community.” Whereupon he replied: “My son, that is why I weep.

And it says elsewhere: <i>Because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever</i> (Amos 1:11). Furthermore, he was forced to flee from Esau and live with Laban for twenty years, under the most trying conditions, as is said: <i>Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me</i> (Gen. 31:40). Later Laban pursued him in order to kill him, as it is stated: <i>And he pursued after him seven days’ journey</i> (ibid., v. 23). When he escaped from Laban, Esau approached him to kill him.

Thereafter, wherever Abel went, Cain ran after him, shouting: “Get off my property.” He fled to the mountains, and Cain pursued him, shouting: “This too belongs to me.” Finally he turned upon him, and killed him, as it is said: <i>And Cain rose against Abel his brother, and slew him</i> (ibid.).", 
        "17_Beshalach, 8_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Furthermore it says: <i>Fear not, thou worm Jacob</i> (Isa. 41:14). Why is Israel compared to a worm? To teach us that just as a worm has only a soft and tender mouth with which to strike at a hard cedar tree, so Israel has only its prayers. Idolaters are likened to a cedar, as Scripture states: <i>Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon</i> (Exod. 31:3). <i>And yea, the Lord breaketh in pieces the cedars in Lebanon</i> (Ps. 29:5). Whenever their enemies overpowered them, the Israelites would become penitent and would plead and pray. Hence it says: <i>I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which I took out of the hand of the Amorites, with my sword and with my bow</i> (Gen 48:29). Did he actually seize it with his sword and his bow? Has it not already been said: <i>For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me</i> (Ps. 44:7)? This implies that <i>my sword</i> refers to prayer and <i>my bow</i> to beseeching. Scripture says: <i>And this for Judah, and he said: “Hear Lord, the voice of Judah,”</i> etc. (Deut. 33:7). Similarly, David said: <i>Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast taunted</i> (I Sam. 17:45). It says also: <i>Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will make mention of the name of the Lord his God</i> (Ps. 20:8), and it is said: <i>There is none beside Thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength; help us, O Lord our God; for we rely on Thee, and in Thy name are we come against this multitude. Thou art the Lord our God; let not man prevail against thee</i> (II Chron. 14:10). Concerning Moses it states: <i>And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom … how our fathers went down into Egypt, and when we cried unto the Lord, He heard our voice</i> (Num. 20:14–15). He said to them: Ye exalt yourselves because of your fathers’ legacy to you, but <i>the voice is the voice of Jacob, and the hands are the hands of Esau</i> (Gen. 27:40). Thus the verse <i>The children of Israel cried out unto the Lord</i> indicates that they followed the practices of their fathers. After they cried out to Him, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself to them, as it is said: <i>But from thence ye will seek the Lord thy God; and thou shall find him</i> (Deut. 4:29).",

However, they are not actually accounted as the firstborn in the genealogy of the people. Another explanation. <i>These are the generations of Jacob</i>. <i>Joseph</i>. You find that Joseph resembled his father in every way, and that everything that happened to Jacob also happened to Joseph. Jacob’s brother was envious of him, and Joseph’s brothers were envious of him; Jacob was exiled to Haran, and Joseph was exiled to Egypt; Jacob said: <i>Whether stolen by day or stolen by night</i> (Gen. 31:39), and Joseph said: <i>For indeed, I was stolen away</i> (ibid. 40:15).",

The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: You said <i>They are almost ready to stone me</i>, now <i>Pass on before the people</i> (ibid. 17:5), and let Me see who will stone you. He began to walk before them, and all the Israelites arose and treated him with honor and deference.

The Holy One, blessed be He, said: When the nations rebelled against Me, I sent guardian angels to serve them, but when you did so, I sent an angel to keep you, as it is said: <i>Behold, I sent an angel before thee, to keep thee</i> (Exod. 14:20). When you are worthy, and accept the Torah, and fulfill My wishes, I shall go before you, as it is said: <i>And the Lord went before them by day and night</i> (Exod. 13:21), but now that you practice idolatry like the other peoples of the world, I will not go before you but shall send only an angel before you.", 
        "24_Pekudei, 2_Siman, 16_Paragraph": "When the Holy One, blessed be he, contemplated fashioning man, he said to the Torah: <i>Let us make man</i> (Gen. 1:26). It replied: Master of the Universe, the man You wish to make <i>is of few days, and full of trouble</i> (Job 14:1), and he will sin. If You are not forbearing with him, it would be better that he should not come into the world. He retorted: Is it for nothing that I am described as <i>Slow to anger and plenteous in loving-kindness</i> (Num. 17:18)? Whereupon He began to collect the dust for the body of the first man from the four corners of the earth, so that no one part of the earth might say: “The dust of the body of man is mine.” If he took the dust from the east and the man wished to travel to the west, the earth of the west might say: “The dust of your body did not come from me, I will not welcome you.” Therefore He took the dust from the four corners of the world, so that wherever man traveled the earth would welcome him, as it is written: <i>For dust thou art</i> (Gen. 3:19).",

What is the meaning of the verse <i>Neither is it found in the land of the living</i>? Does it mean that the Oral Law is found only among the deceased? Indeed not. It means that the Oral Law is not found among those who pursue the pleasures of this world—its passions, its glory, or its greatness, but only among those who deprive themselves for its sake, as it is said: <i>This is the law; when a man dieth in a tent</i> (Num. 19:40). The following is the path that leads to an understanding of the law: “A morsel of bread with salt shall you eat; a measure of water shall you drink; upon the earth shall you sleep; a life of hardship shall you lead; and in the law shall you labor.”<sup>5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Pirkei Avot 6:4.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, established His covenant with Israel through the Oral Law, as it is said: <i>According to the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel</i> (Exod. 34:27).",

This is followed by: <i>For the Lord your God, He is God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath</i> (Josh. 2:10–11). It is also written: <i>And the idols shall utterly pass away</i> (Isa. 2:18), <i>And at that time the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day</i> (ibid., v. 17).

How do we know that he was greatly occupied with the Torah? It is said: <i>And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread nor drink wine</i> (Exod. 34:28). During the day the Holy One, blessed be He, taught him the Written Law, and at night He instructed him in the Oral Law.

Moses did not fail to prostrate himself in a single corner while pleading in their behalf, until the Holy One, blessed be He, became reconciled with them.

R. Nahman the son of Isaac explained: He then arranged a banquet for them at which he decided to have Benjamin sit at his side, but he did not know, at first, how to accomplish it. Whereupon, he took the goblet, struck it, and said to them: “I was of the opinion that Judah was the firstborn, since he was the first to speak, but now I discover that Reuben is the firstborn, and that Judah is simply a garrulous individual.” And he sat Reuben at the head of the table. Then he took the goblet once again, struck it, and told Simeon: “Sit alongside of him, for you are the second son.” He likewise seated Levi, Judah, and all the rest according to their ages. Then he took the goblet once again, struck it, and declared: “I have discovered through this cup that you are all the sons of one father, but that your father had a number of wives.” He then told Dan and Naphtali to be seated according to their ages. At last, only Benjamin remained unseated. “I see that this one had a brother, from whom he is separated, and that he is an orphan.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Their mother, Rachel was already dead.</i> I too had a brother from whom I am separated.

One of them invited all the men of the city to his banquet, but failed to invite the king’s sons, while the other invited neither the men of that city nor the king’s sons.

We find that a single star is suspended over all creation that is below it, yet when that star passes by, another replaces it, and all creation is beneath the second star. Just as you perceive a certain star above your head, so too all mankind perceive it above their heads, though it appears to be no larger than the flame of a candle.

The Israelites said to the Holy One, blessed be He:, <i>O that thou wert as my brother</i>, yet you find that all brothers hated each other. Cain hated Abel, as it is said: <i>And Cain rose up against Abel his brother</i> (Gen. 4:8). Ishmael hated Isaac, as is said: <i>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, making sport</i> (Gen. 21:9). <i>Making sport</i> implies, in this instance, that he wanted to kill him, as it is said: <i>Let the young men, I pray thee, arise and make sport before us</i> (II Sam. 2:14). Esau hated Jacob, as is said: <i>And Esau said in his heart</i>, etc. (Gen. 27:41). And the tribes hated Joseph, as it is said: <i>And they hated him</i> (Gen. 37:4). But in this instance the Israelites asked of the Holy One, blessed be He: Do you mean like Moses and Aaron, of whom it is said: <i>Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity</i> (Ps. 133:1)?

After speaking to Pharaoh, he brought on the second plague. He performed magical feats in his presence, but he (Pharaoh) would not pay heed to them. God said to Moses: <i>Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn</i> (<i>kabed</i>), <i>he refuseth to let the people go</i> (ibid., v. 14). Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, exclaimed: Wretch!

But why did they call the Sanhedrin a navel? Just as the navel is located in the center of a man’s body, so the Sanhedrin met in a chamber of hewn stone in the center of the Temple. Furthermore, just as the child, whose mouth is closed while within its mother’s womb, is sustained through the navel, so the Israelites were sustained only by virtue of the Sanhedrin.

If he sees robbers behind him and the wolf before him, he takes his son in his arms. The Holy One, blessed be He, did likewise for Israel. When the sea was before them and the Egyptians behind, He bore them in His arms. When Israel began to suffer from the sun, He spread His cloak over them, as it is said: <i>He spread a cloud for a screen</i> (Ps. 105:39). When Israel became hungry, He gave them bread, as is stated: <i>Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you</i> (Exod. 16:4).

What did He do? He fashioned her out of one of Adam’s ribs, a chaste portion of the body, so that she would stay modestly at home, as it is said: <i>And the rib which the Lord had taken</i> (Gen. 2:22). Nevertheless, women do not lack any of these failings. He did not create her from the head of Adam lest she be haughty, nevertheless the daughters of Zion arose and were haughty, as is said: <i>Moreover, the Lord said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty</i> (Isa. 3:16). He did not fashion her from his eyes lest she be inquisitive, yet Eve was inquisitive, as it is said: <i>And the woman saw that the tree was good</i> (Gen. 3:6). He did not mold her from his mouth lest she babble, but Leah came and babbled, as it is written: <i>And she said unto her: “Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband?”</i> (Gen. 30:15), and it states elsewhere: <i>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</i> (Num. 12:1). He did not create her from the ear, lest she eavesdrop, yet Sarah did eavesdrop, as is said: <i>And Sarah heard in the tent door</i> (Gen. 18:10); He did not fashion her out of his hand, lest she steal, nevertheless Rachel stole the teraphim, as it is said: <i>And Rachel stole</i> (ibid. 31:19); He did not create her from the foot, lest she be a gadabout, but Leah came and was a gadabout, as is said: <i>And Leah went out</i> (ibid. 30:16), and similarly <i>Dinah went out</i> (ibid. 34:1).",

But I foresaw what they would ultimately do; that they would make the golden calf, since they had been idolaters, and would, therefore, lead My people to sin with them. Observe what is written: <i>And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said: “This is thy god, O Israel”</i> (ibid. 32:4). The verse does not say “This is our god” but rather <i>This is thy</i> god. Hence it was the proselytes who had left Egypt with them who erected it. How much gold did the calf contain? R. Tanhum the son of Hanilai stated: It contained a hundred and twenty-five talents of gold, for that is how much (the letters of the word) <i>molten</i> total arithmetically. R.

In the days of Enoch the son of Seth, as it is said: <i>Then began man to call in the name of the Lord</i> (Gen. 4:25). It was then that the Mediterranean Sea rose and inundated a third of the world, and the Holy One, blessed be He, said: Ye have done a new thing in calling yourself by My name, and so I will do something new and call Myself by My name.

        "4_Lech Lecha, 16_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Abraham sat and wondered where he was to be circumcised, after the Holy One, blessed be Him, informed him: <i>I will establish My covenant between Me and thee</i> (Gen. 17:2). What follows this verse? <i>And Abraham fell on his face</i> (ibid., v. 3). Once he fell on his face, the Holy One, blessed be He, indicated that place, and a scorpion bit him there. Forthwith, Abraham found himself circumcised. Whence do we know this? We know it from the verse <i>And God spoke unto him, saying: As for Me, behold, My covenant is with thee</i> (ibid., vv. 3–4); that is, behold, thou art circumcised. Furthermore, it is written: <i>In the self-same day was Abraham circumcised</i> (ibid., v. 26). Scripture does not say “he circumcised himself” but he <i>was circumcised.</i>", 
        "9_Vayishlach, 1_Siman, 4_Paragraph": "R. Huna said in the name of R. Hiyya: The <i>mighty</i> ones are the Israelites, who placed doing before hearing, by declaring: <i>All that the Lord hath spoken will we do and obey</i> (Exod. 24:7). This verse teaches us that the righteous are superior to the ministering angels. You know this as well from the following incident: At the moment Isaiah exclaimed: <i>Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips</i> (Isa. 6:5), the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked him, saying: You may say of yourself <i>A man of unclean lips am I</i>, but you may not say of Israel, <i>In the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell</i>. They placed doing before hearing, and they declare the Unity of My Name twice daily, yet you would call them <i>a people of unclean lips</i>? What is written there? <i>Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, with a glowing stone in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar</i> (Isa. 6:6). What is meant by <i>ritzpah</i> (“a glowing stone”)? It means “smash the mouth” (<i>rutz peh</i>) of anyone who speaks ill of My people. <i>With tongs</i>. What does this signify? It teaches us that there were two tongs (because the text uses the dual form of the noun). At first the angel attempted to take the glowing stone with his fingers, but he burned himself. Then he took a tong to lift the stone but was burned again. Finally, he took a second tong, which he attached to the first, and with them he took from the altar the glowing stone and touched it to the lips of Isaiah, as is said: <i>He touched my mouth with it, and said: Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated</i> (ibid., v. 7). All this occurred because Isaiah had said: <i>In the midst of a people of unclean lips</i>. The Seraph was forced to remove the glowing stone with the tongs because he could not lift it with his hand. Indeed, he was compelled to use two tongs, yet when he touched Isaiah’s lips with it, Isaiah was not burned. Hence, Scripture states: <i>His camp is very great, for he is mighty who executeth his word</i> (Joel 2:11). Who are they <i>who executeth His word</i>? The righteous men.",

Joshua explained: If the opportunity to perform a good deed comes to you in the morning, carry it out, and if the opportunity occurs in the evening, perform it as well, for it is said: <i>Withhold not thy hand</i>.

Does he not normally fence in his fields with thorns and thistles, with pits and thornbushes? What then is the meaning of <i>Set about with lilies</i>? This refers to numerous commandments that are as sensitive as lilies. For example, a man is extremely anxious to enter his bridal chamber, for no day is dearer to him than that day. It is the day on which he rejoices with his bride. What does he do? He spends a considerable amount of money to set up the bridal chamber and he comes to have intercourse with her. But if she says to him: “I have seen something like a red lily (i.e., the blood of menstruation), he draws away from her. He turns his face to one side and she to the other. What compelled him to turn from her? Was it a snake biting him, a scorpion stinging him, or a thorn between them? No, only the words of the Torah, since it is said: <i>And thou shalt not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness</i> (Lev. 18:19). Hence it is written: <i>Set about like lilies</i>.",

Bring my soul out of prison refers to Noah, who was imprisoned in the ark. R. Levi said: Neither Noah nor his sons were able to sleep during the entire twelve months (in the ark) because they were obliged to feed the animals, the beasts, and the birds. R.

From the Holy One Himself, blessed be He, as is said: <i>And God saw that the light was good</i> (Gen. 1:4). After that Scripture states: <i>And God divided the light from the darkness</i> (ibid.).

He was terrified because he had killed him. He said to himself: “I have slain the son of this righteous man, now he will curse me and I shall die.” The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: Fear not, for not only will he not curse you, but he will go forth to meet you bearing gifts and will bless you, as it is said: <i>And Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine … and he blessed him, and said</i>: “… <i>blessed be God the Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand</i>” (Gen. 14:18–20). What is the meaning of the word migen (“delivered”)? It indicates that the Holy One, blessed be He, performed a miraculous feat (<i>manganah</i>) when <i>He delivered</i> (<i>migen</i>) <i>your enemies into your hand.</i> Abraham grasped the dust and hurled it at his enemies, and the Holy One, blessed be He, converted the dust into arrows, bows, and spears, as it is said: <i>His sword maketh them as the dust, His bow as the driven stubble.

David exclaimed: <i>Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord, or make all His praise be heard?</i> (Ps. 105:2), while Job declared: <i>Shall it be told Him that I speak? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</i> (Job 37:20).

After they had performed the wicked deed, Moses descended from the mountain and, as he approached the camp, observed the golden calf they had made. Until that moment, the tablets that the Holy One, blessed be He, had given him had been virtually self-borne, but as he descended the mountain, approached the camp, and saw the calf, the letters flew from the tablets and they became heavy in the hands of Moses.

Why should he rejoice? Because the Torah <i>is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is everyone that holdeth her fast</i> (Prov. 3:8). Therefore Zebulun preceded Issachar. If it had not been for Zebulun, Issachar could not have studied the Torah. Since Issachar engaged exclusively in the study of the Torah, and was not concerned with business nor did any kind of work, it is written about him: <i>And the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times</i> (I Chron. 12:33).",

Abraham had three friends, Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre, and when the Holy One commanded Abraham to circumcise himself, he consulted each of them. He went first to Aner and related to him what the Holy One had said. Aner replied: “Do you wish to cripple yourself so severely that when the descendants of the kings whom you have slain attack, you will be unable even to flee from them?” He left him and went to Eshkol and told him what the Lord had commanded. Eshkol responded: “You are an old man, and if you are circumcised, considerable blood will flow from you, and you will not be able to survive the loss and will perish.” Whereupon he departed from him, and went to Mamre and said: “What do you advise?” Mamre retorted: “Need you seek my advice in such a matter? Did He not release you from the fiery furnace, perform miracles in your behalf, and rescue you from kings? The fact is that you would have been destroyed long ago were it not for His strength and His might. He saved your two hundred and forty-eight limbs, and yet you ask advice concerning merely a piece of one of your organs.

Because the whole world was founded from it. Shlomo knew which ligament extended to Kush and planted pepper on it, and it produced immediately, just as he said “and I planted in them trees of every kind.” Another explanation: “and I planted in them fruit trees of every kind…” Just as the navel is placed in the middle of a man, so is the Land of Israel the navel of the world, as it says “those who sit on the center of the land (Ezekiel 38:12).

It likewise says: <i>He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding</i> (Dan. 2:21), and <i>Forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royalty, there is none like unto Thee</i> (Jer. 10:7).", 
        "8_Vayetzei, 6_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "Another explanation of <i>He executeth justice for the oppressed</i>: This refers to Rachel, who was oppressed when her father should have sat her in the bridal litter. He placed Leah in it instead, extinguished the candles, and then led Rachel out by the hand. Is there any oppression greater than this? Who dealt justly with her? <i>He who giveth bread to the hungry</i>. When was that? When she hungered for children. <i>The Lord looseth those that are bound up</i> (ibid.), as it is said: <i>And God remembered Rachel</i>. Why were the matriarchs barren (for so many years)? R. Huna said in the name of R. Hiyya the son of Abba: In order that they might spend many years of their lives free of burdensome responsibilities.", 
        "21_Tetzaveh, 2_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And thou shalt command the children of Israel (Exod. 27:20).</b> If the lamp which is not for the purpose of eating requires pure olive oil, should not the meal-offerings, which are for the purpose of eating, require pure olive oil? However, Scripture reserves pure olive oil for the light, but not for the meal-offering. R. Hanina, chief of the priests, said: I used to minister in the Temple, and there was a miraculous thing which occurred with the lamp. When they lit the lamp at the beginning of the year, it did not go out until the following year. But once, it happened that the olives did not provide sufficient pure olive oil, and the priests began to weep. Then R. Hanina, chief of the priests, continued: I was in the Temple at that time, and I discovered that the lamp was burning more brightly than at any time during the year. That, indeed, was a miracle, and that is why Scripture specifies pounded pure olive oil beaten for the light, but not for the meal-offering. Why is that so? Since the Holy One, blessed be He, has decreed that they should light the lamp only once a year, they must burn pure pounded olive oil in the lamp, but inasmuch as the meal-offering was sacrificed every day, <i>pure oil pounded</i> was not specified. Our sages of blessed memory said: When they lit the lamp, all the courtyards in Jerusalem were illumined by them. Thus it is said: <i>That they bring unto Thee pure olive oil beaten for the light</i>.",

Because the Torah was located at the right hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said: <i>At His right hand was a fiery law unto them</i> (Deut. 33:2), therefore the ark was precious because the Torah was placed within it. As it is said: <i>The tables were the work of God</i> (Exod. 32:16).",

How do we know this? (That is what the Holy One, blessed be He, told Gad the prophet when He said: <i>Go and tell My servant David: “Thus saith the Lord: Shalt thou build for Me a house for Me to dwell in?”</i> [II Sam. 7:5]. However, following that it is written: <i>Nevertheless, Thou shalt not build the house, but thy son that shalt come out of thy loins, he shall build the house for My name</i> [I Kings 8:19]. But if you should build it, then, as it is said:)<sup>16</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Etz Joseph</i> suggests that this text is out of place.</i> <i>I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant it, that they may dwell in their own place</i> (II Sam. 7:10). “I will plant them” is not written in this verse, but rather <i>plant it</i>, indicating that the world would then be firmly established.",

It is Reuben, as it is said: <i>Let Reuben live and not die</i> (Deut. 33:6).

David said: Master of the Universe, the Israelites are a contentious lot; do You wish them to murmur against me amongst themselves? A proof of this is that after the Tabernacle was erected, though everything was done according to numbers and weights, as it is written: <i>The whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written at that time</i> (Ezra 8:34), they became contentious, as is said: <i>And the people spoke against God, and against Moses</i> (Num. 21:15). Hence, it says: <i>Thou mayest deliver me from the contentions of My people</i> (II Sam. 22:44). This verse alludes to Moses. At the time he erected the Tabernacle, Moses said: I know that the Israelites are a troublesome lot. They speak against their brothers and their mothers, as it is said: <i>Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s sons</i> (Ps. 50:20). What is meant by <i>Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother</i>? R. Johanan said: You must not believe that one is permitted to speak against a brother born of one’s father, but not against a brother born of one’s mother, for if you should speak against your brother born of your father, you will eventually speak against your brother born of your mother, as it is said: <i>Thou sittest and speakest against thine own brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s sons</i>.",

But if He should not descend, then let us wage war against Him.” The Holy One, blessed be He, did not restrain them, but declared instead: Do whatever ye desire, as it is said: <i>And now nothing will be withholden from them, which they propose to do</i> (ibid., v. 6). <i>He that sitteth in heaven laugheth. The Lord hath them in derision</i> (Ps. 2:4). Had He not permitted them to build the tower, they would have claimed: “If we had built the tower, we would have ascended and waged war against Him.” Therefore, He allowed them to erect the tower. After that, He looked down upon them and scattered them, as is said: <i>Thence did the Lord scatter them</i> (Gen. 11:9). He rebuked them, saying: You declared <i>Lest we be scattered over the entire earth;</i> therefore you shall be scattered over the face of the earth. Hence it is written: <i>The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon them</i> (Prov. 10:24).",

Eleazar the son of Pedat said: It is written about them: <i>Twixt morning and evening they are shattered; they perish forever without any regarding it</i> (Job 4:20). Therefore it says: <i>Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them</i> (Exod. 21:1). Another explanation. Because the generation of the flood did not perform the ordinances, it is written about them: <i>My spirit shall not abide in man forever</i> (Gen. 6:3).",

When Aaron’s two sons entered the tent of meeting to offer a strange fire, <i>There came forth fire from before the Lord and consumed them</i> (Lev. 10:2). Their souls were consumed but not their clothing or their bodies, as it is said: <i>them</i> (ibid.). This happened because they were descended from Shem. This concerns the righteous. Whence do we know about what happens to wicked men? When Sennacherib departed from Jerusalem, the bodies of his forces were consumed but not their clothing. Why did this happen to them? Because they too were the descendants of Shem the son of Noah, as it is said: <i>The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad</i> (Gen. 10:22). And it is written: <i>God enlargeth Japheth</i> (ibid. 9:27); yet even so: <i>And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem</i> (ibid., v. 26).", 
        "21_Tetzaveh, 14_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon (Exod. 30:1).</b> Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: <i>Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart</i> (Prov. 27:9). This verse refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, and to Israel. How is that? When the high priest was officiating on the Day of Atonement, he would place the incense in a pan and bring it into the innermost part of the Holy of Holies, as it is written: <i>And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar</i>. What else is written there? <i>Ye shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the incense may cover the ark cover</i> (Lev. 16:12–13). What is the meaning of <i>may cover</i>? It is an expression that indicates forgiveness, as in the verse <i>Thou hast covered up all their sins</i> (Ps. 85:3). Whenever the cloud of incense ascended and spiraled upward, like a cluster of grapes, on the Day of Atonement, he knew that Israel’s sins were forgiven, as it is said: <i>My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna in the vineyards of En-gedi</i> (Song 1:14). If the smoke of the incense resembled a cluster and rose straight upward, he knew that Israel was forgiven and his service was acceptable, but if the smoke of the incense did not cover the ark-cover he knew that he would die, as it is said: <i>That the cloud of the incense may cover the ark-cover that is upon the testimony, that he die not</i> (Lev. 16:13). Consequently, the high priest and all Israel trembled from the moment the high priest entered the innermost Sanctuary until he withdrew in peace. When he departed from the Sanctuary a great rejoicing took place among the Israelites, since it meant that it (the offering) had been received favorably, as it is said: <i>Ointment and incense rejoice the heart</i> (Prov. 27:9).",

No one would dare don the crown of a human king, but in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will place His crown upon the head of King Messiah. What is the crown of the Holy One, blessed be He, like? The crown of the Holy One, blessed be He, is of the finest gold, as it is said: <i>His head is of the most fine gold</i> (Song 5:11), and it is also written about Him elsewhere: <i>Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head</i> (Isa. 21:4).",

It is for this reason that we do not say the eighteen benedictions on the Sabbath.<sup>3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On Sabbaths and holy dayss the thirteen intervening blessings are omitted lest the holiness of the day be marred by references to mundane affairs; a single benediction describing the characteristic feature of the day is inserted, in their place.</i> For, if it should happen that a loved one was ill at home at the time of praying, the worshipper would be reminded of it while reciting the prayer “Who healeth the ills of His people” and would become depressed. Inasmuch as the Sabbath was given to Israel for sanctification, for joy and rest and not for sorrow, one must recite the first three blessings and the final three blessings (of the Amidah) and replace the intervening ones with the prayer of Rest. Hence, David proclaimed: <i>Seven times a day do I praise Thee, because of Thy righteous ordinances</i> (Ps. 119:164). The word <i>seven</i> in this verse refers to the seven benedictions recited on the Sabbath. What other day could this verse refer to, if not the day of rest, which is unlike any other? For it is said: <i>Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy</i> (Exod. 20:8)—in every respect, even <i>from in the pursuit of thy business and speaking thereof</i> (Isa. 58:13).",

He explained: The robber equates the dignity of the servant with the dignity of the Master, while the thief does not equate the dignity of the servant to that of the Master. He (the thief) acts as though the eyes of the Almighty were unable to see him and His ears were incapable of hearing him. He moves about stealthily while perpetrating his thievery, as though he can be seen by man but not by God. Therefore it says: <i>Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say: “Who seeth us?

Hence the words <i>God is not a man that He should lie</i> refer to His promises of good, and the words <i>When He hath said, will He not do it?</i> allude to His threats of misfortune. You know this is so also from what is written concerning the angels’ visit to Sarah: <i>I will certainly return to thee; and, lo, Sarah, thy wife, shall have a son</i> (Gen. 18:10).

Inasmuch as it is said concerning them: <i>Thy two breasts are like two fawns, that are twins of a gazelle</i> (Song 4:5). <i>Thy hair was grown</i> implies that the time for redemption had arrived, but <i>naked and bare</i> signify that Israel had not yet performed any good deeds.

        "17_Beshalach, 15_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "Does He actually require the assistance of others that it says, He sent an angel against Sennacherib but he did not kill them, since <i>When He bloweth upon them they wither</i> (Isa. 40:24)? This teaches us that whosoever helps Israel is considered as though helping the Shekhinah. Therefore it is written: <i>For He is highly exalted</i>. You have exalted yourself greatly through those who rebelled against You. Who were they that rebelled against You? The ones who attacked Your children: <i>Chedorlaomer, king of Elam … and he divided himself against them by night</i> (Gen. 14:1, 15). <i>Who hath raised up one from the east, at whose steps victory attendeth … he pursueth them and passeth on</i> (I Sam. 41:2–3). Scripture also says: <i>The Lord said unto my lord: “Sit thou at My right hand, until I make Mine enemies thy footstool.” The rod of thy strength the Lord will send out of Zion: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” Thy people offer themselves willingly in the day of thy warfare, in adornments of holiness, from the womb of the dawn, thine is the dew of thy youth. The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent; “Thou art a priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek.” The Lord at thy right hand doth crush kings in the day of His wrath</i> (Ps. 110:1–5).",

Simeon added: Peace is considered of such importance that the Torah utters a falsehood for its sake. Where is this falsehood to be found? The Torah states: <i>Thy father did command before he died, saying: So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin</i> (Gen. 50:16–17), but the fact is that we are unable to discover any such statement made by Jacob.

Because the Torah is called the tree of life, as it is said: <i>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her</i> (Prov. 3:18). <i>He overlaid it with pure gold</i> (Exod. 37:2). Because the words of the Torah are more precious than gold, yea, than fine gold, as is said: <i>More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold</i> (Ps. 19:11). <i>And thou shalt make staves of acacia-wood wherewith to bear the ark</i> (Exod. 25:15).

Concerning them it is written: <i>As for the earth, out of it cometh bread, and underneath it is turned up as it were by fire. The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, and it hath dust of gold. That path no bird of prey knoweth, neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it; the proud beasts have not trodden it, nor hath the lion passed thereby</i> (Job 28:5–8). They said: There is no reason why we should permit men to travel over our highways, for they deprive us of our food, silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls. Let us abrogate the law of unrestricted travel in our land. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, told them: Since you have become arrogant because of the good things I lavished upon you, I will cause you to be forgotten in the world, as it is said: <i>He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot that passeth by; they hang afar from men</i> (ibid., v. 4). It is written also: <i>A contemptible brand in the thought of him that is at ease … the tents of the robbers prosper</i> (ibid. 12:5). What happened to them for this? <i>In whatsoever God hath brought into their hand</i> (ibid., v. 6). Thus it says: <i>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and careless ease was in her and her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy</i> (Ezek. 16:49). Likewise it says; <i>Before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah they were like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt</i> (Gen. 13:10). But after that is written: <i>And they made their father drink wine that night</i> (ibid. 19:33). Where did they obtain the wine for the meal? The Omnipresent provided the wine for the meal, as it is said: <i>And it shall come to pass in that day, the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the Lord</i> (Joel 4:18).

The king called one of them from the work he was performing to take a stroll. That evening, when the workers came for their pay, the worker who had taken the stroll with the king also came for his. If the king should say to him: “You worked with the others for only two hours; go finish your time,” he could reply: “If you had not interrupted and taken me from my work, my pay would have been even greater than theirs.” Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, may His name be blessed, is a King, and those who labor in the Torah are His workers. One who has devoted himself to the Torah for fifty or thirty or twenty years is able to say: “If you had not taken me from this world, I would still be occupied in the study of the Torah.” Hence Solomon said: <i>Whether he eat little or much</i> his reward is the same.",

That is to say, they gave birth to children, but neglected to circumcise them. This teaches us that after Joseph’s death the people disregarded the covenant of circumcision, saying: Let us be like the Egyptians. When the Holy One, blessed be He, observed this, He suppressed the love He bore them, as it is said: <i>He turned their heart to hate His people</i> (Ps. 125:22).",

R. Isaac related an anecdote about a house filled with lighted torches. The master of the house told his servant: “Light some lamps for us in the courtyard.” “But the house is fully lighted,” he replied, “why do you bid me to light lamps in the courtyard?” He answered: “Do it so that the servants will have light.”",

It is written: <i>Then thou shalt inquire, and make search, and ask diligently, and behold if it be true</i> (Deut. 13:15). At the time they examined the witnesses concerning a sin an individual had committed, the Sanhedrin and all the Israelites would go out into the public square. They brought there the individual who had been charged with the offense which required stoning or one of the four death penalties that were imposed by the Beth Din. Two or three of the most distinguished leaders of the community would come forth and would question the witness. After they returned from the cross-examination, a member of the Sanhedrin would say to them: “What is your decision?” They would announce whether he was to live or to die. If he were to be sentenced to stoning, they would bring a pleasant-tasting but potent wine, and give it to him to drink so that he would not suffer pain from the stoning. Then the witnesses would come, bind his hands and feet, and place him where the stoning was to occur. The witnesses would then take a large stone, (large) enough to kill him, and would place it upon his heart. How did they place it on his heart? They did so simultaneously in order that no one of them might lower his portion of the stone before his companion.<sup>4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And therefore be solely responsible for his death.</i> They would place it on his heart together to conform to the verse: <i>Thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death</i> (Deut. 13:10).

It was the day on which a man could refer only to <i>yesterday</i> and not to “the day before yesterday.” When could a man refer to <i>yesterday</i>? Only on the second day (of Creation), which was preceded by the first day of the week. After that He created the dry land on the third day of the week, as it is said: <i>Who didst establish the earth upon its foundations, that it should never be moved forever and ever</i> (Ps. 104:5). He covered one part of the world, and uncovered another. To what may this be compared? To a man who owns two slaves, and strips the clothing from one in order to cloth the other. The Holy One, blessed be He, did likewise. He gathered the waters beneath the heavens to one place, and in that way uncovered the earth while covering the deep, as it is said: <i>Thou didst cover the deep as with a vesture</i> (ibid., v. 6).",

Because they forced the Israelites to draw water for them, He turned their water to blood. They conspired to have them bear burdens, and so He brought the frogs against them to consume what they had carried. They schemed to make them work upon the land, and so the gnats swarmed over the land. They decided to compel them to serve as tutors to their children, and He sent herds of lions, wolves, leopards, bears, and eagles against them. When an Egyptian who had five children ordered an Israelite to take them to the marketplace, a lion would appear and seize one of them; a wolf, another; and a leopard, a bear, and an eagle would each seize one more. When he returned alone to the home of the Egyptian, he would ask him: “Where are my sons?” “I will tell you what happened,” he would answer, “A lion came and took one; a wolf, another; and a leopard and a bear each took another.”",

They retorted: “It is not barley, but wheat.” “Then charge me the duty for wheat,” said he. “But it may be pepper,” they argued. “Then take the tax for pepper,” he insisted. They said to him: “It must be gold coins.” Finally, they compelled him to open the box. When they beheld her countenance, which was as radiant as the sun, they said to him: “Truly, she is not meant for a commoner.” <i>And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her unto Pharaoh</i> (Gen. 12:15). When Abraham saw this, he began to weep, and to supplicate the Holy One, blessed be He: “Master of the Universe, is this to be my reward for my abiding faith in You? For the sake of Your compassion and Your loving-kindness, do not put my trust in You to shame.” Sarah likewise cried out: “Master of the Universe, I knew nothing at all, but when he told me that you commanded him: <i>Get thee out of thy country,</i> I trusted in Your word.

        "22_Ki Tisa, 14_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And he gave unto Moses when he had made an end of speaking (Exod. 31:18).</b> Scripture states with reference to this verse: <i>A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men</i> (Prov. 18:16). The gift a man gives out of his own possessions resounds to his advantage, as is told about Abun Ramaah,<sup>20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deut. R. chapter 4, sect. 8, where he is called Abin the deceiver, not deceitful, simply cunning in giving charity.</i> who resided in Bozrah.<sup>21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An Idumean town in which a number of scholars lived.</i> Our rabbis went there to obtain a contribution from him. However, he refused to contribute anything at all until all the men of the community had made their contributions. Then he contributed an amount equal to all the others. That is why he was called Abun, the deceiver. What did our rabbis do after that? They sat him amongst themselves to fulfill what is written: <i>A man’s gift maketh room for him</i>. Another explanation of <i>And He gave unto Moses</i> is contained in the verse: <i>Thou hast also given me Thy shield of salvation, and Thy right hand hath holden me up; and Thy condescension hath made me great</i> (Ps. 18:26). <i>Thou hast given me Thy shield of salvation</i> refers to the Israelites, who trust in the Holy One, blessed be He; <i>Thy right hand hath holden me up</i> alludes to the Torah, as it says: <i>At His right hand a fiery law unto them</i> (Deut. 33:2); <i>And Thy condescension hath made me great</i> relates to the condescension of the Holy One, blessed be He.", 
        "18_Yitro, 3_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "Solomon had declared: <i>Wherefore I praise the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive</i> (Eccles. 4:2). However, later he retracted this statement, saying: <i>A living dog is better than a dead lion</i> (ibid. 9:4). They replied to him: Solomon, you were merely prattling, making no sense at all. First you said: <i>Wherefore I praise the dead that are already dead</i>, but now you say: <i>A living dog is better than a dead lion</i>. He retorted: I say to you: <i>The prophet cried out: O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord</i> (Ezek. 37:4), and they hearkened to him, but the prophet also called out to the living: <i>Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob</i> (Jer. 2:4), and they did not listen nor pay heed to him. Thus it says of them: <i>For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children that refuse to hear the teaching of the Lord</i> (Isa. 30:9).",

Indeed, all his sons deserved to die, as it is said: <i>Moreover, the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him</i> (Deut. 9:20). <i>Have destroyed</i> is an expression used to indicate the complete elimination of offspring, as it is said: <i>Yet I have destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath</i> (Amos 2:9). Because Moses prayed for him, as it is written: <i>And I prayed for Aaron also the same time</i> (Deut. 9:29), only two of his sons perished, while the other two survived.",

R. Simeon the son of Lakish contended: This verse refers to the Messiah. <i>Smote the image</i> alludes to all the kingdoms that serve idols. Why is the rule of the Messiah likened to stone? It is likened to stone because of the Torah in which Israel labors, as it is said: <i>The two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God</i> (Exod. 31:18). Another explanation as to why it is likened to a stone. It is because of the merit of Jacob, concerning whom it is written: <i>From thence, from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel</i> (Gen. 49:24).", 
        "21_Tetzaveh, 9_Siman, 6_Paragraph": "When Aaron saw what had happened he built the altar. He took the gold nose rings and cast them into the fire, as it is said: <i>I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf</i> (ibid., v. 24). Aaron was afraid that the Holy One, blessed be He, was angry with him, and so the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses: <i>And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them</i> (Exod. 29:1); that is, elevate Aaron and his sons to the high priesthood, to make it known that Aaron had acted only out of fear. In that way he made them realize that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not hold the deed of the golden calf against them.",

As soon as he realized his own importance, he began to eat, drink, and curl his hair, and say: “Blessed be the Omnipotent One who has caused me to forget my father’s house.” Whereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked him, saying: Your father mourns for you in sackcloth and ashes, but you eat and drink and curl your hair; therefore, your mistress will impose herself on you and will torment you. Hence it is written: <i>His master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph</i> (ibid., v. 7).<i>But he refused</i> (ibid., v. 8).",

Johanan the son of Zakkai said: Scripture states: <i>Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of unhewn stones</i> (Deut. 27:6), for it will help to achieve peace between the Israelites and their Father in heaven. A logical conclusion may be derived from this. If the stones of the altar, which cannot see or hear or speak, achieve peace between Israel and their Father in heaven, so that the Torah commands that iron should not be wielded over them, how much more so, then, should one who promotes peace between husband and wife, or between a man and his companion, have his days and his years prolonged.", 
        "14_Shemot, 8_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "Moses perceived through the Holy Spirit what the Egyptian had done to the man’s wife and that now he was beating her husband as well, and he said to him: “Is it not enough that you violated his wife, must you then smite him also?” He became enraged at the Egyptian, <i>And he looked this way and that way</i> (Exod. 2:12). Obviously, he was aware that the Egyptian had violated the woman and was now smiting her husband. When he saw that there was no man there, (he knew) that the man was destined to die at his hands: <i>And he smote the Egyptian</i> (ibid., v. 12). With what did he smite him? Some say that he took a trowel full of clay and smashed his skull. Others insist that he invoked the Divine Name and slew him, as it says: <i>Sayest thou to kill me?</i> (ibid., v. 14) (i.e., “Will you kill me with a ‘saying,’ a word?).",

He began to teach them how they should purify themselves so that they might eat in holiness; how they should immerse themselves so that they might eat in levitical purity; and how they should sanctify themselves so that they might eat in cleanliness.

He arranged them in the form of a mound, with one ram placed on either side and with the bullock in the middle. Why did he use three? Because they corresponded to the three illustrious men of the world, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The bullock symbolized Abraham: <i>And Abraham ran unto the herd</i> (Gen. 18:7); and the two rams symbolized Isaac and Jacob. <i>And unleavened bread</i>. Because of the merit of unleavened bread, I shall bless the bread. R.

Is there anything lacking in Scripture that it should add: <i>And wrought great provocations</i>? They were reproaching and blaspheming as they sated themselves with the manna and brought some of it as an offering to the calf. They blasphemed with all their strength and indulged in revelry, but nevertheless: <i>Thou withholdest not Thy manna from their mouth</i> (ibid., v. 20). Hence, <i>Unto Thee O Lord belongeth righteousness</i>. R. Levi said: While Israel remained on the ground fashioning a calf, as it is said: <i>And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with an engraving tool</i> (Exod. 32:4), the Holy One, blessed be He, was above them engraving the life-giving words on the tablets, as it is said: <i>And He gave unto Moses when He had made an end of speaking</i>.",

This verse alludes to those who honor the students of the Torah.", 
        "7_Toldot, 11_Siman, 6_Paragraph": "Similarly, one’s feet are not always within one’s control. There is a biblical verse that confirms this: <i>A man’s goings are of the Lord; how, then, can man look to his way?</i> (Prov. 20:24). Frequently, a man will depart upon a journey without knowing his ultimate destination; whether it will be for good or evil, for death or for life. Thus Elijah told the Arameans: <i>This is not the way, neither is this the city</i> (II Kings 6:19). The mouth likewise is not completely under man’s control. We learn this from the experience of Balaam and Isaac. Regarding Balaam, it is said: <i>Nevertheless, the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam, but the Lord thy God turned the curse unto a blessing</i> (Deut. 23:6). In reference to Isaac we find that when Esau entered, Isaac began to tremble and was on the verge of saying: “Cursed shall he be.” The Holy One, blessed be He, called out to him: What do you intend to do? Do you believe that your mouth is under your control? Thereupon he reconsidered and said: <i>Blessed shall he be</i>. Thus, it is said: <i>The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them</i> (Prov. 20:12).",

        "7_Toldot, 8_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old (Gen. 27:1).</b> Scripture states elsewhere in reference to this verse: <i>Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shalt make princes in all the land</i> (Ps. 45:17). R. Eliezer the son of R. Yosé the Galilean maintained: The descendants born to every Israelite in the future will be as numerous as those who departed from Egypt, as it is said: <i>Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons</i>. This verse refers to our patriarchs Isaac and Abraham. Abraham was blessed, as it is said: <i>And the Lord blessed Abraham with everything</i> (Gen. 24:1), and Isaac was likewise blessed, as is written: <i>And the Lord blessed him</i> (ibid. 26:12). Abraham begot both a righteous and a wicked son, Isaac and Ishmael; and Isaac begot both a righteous and a wicked son, Jacob and Esau. Abraham’s wife was barren (at first), and Isaac’s wife was also barren (at first).", 
        "23_Vayakhel, 6_Siman, 14_Paragraph": "What is meant by <i>The kine took the straight way (vayisharnah)</i>? It means that the kine opened their mouths and sang (<i>vayashir</i>). When the kine reached Beth-shemesh and the people saw the cart and heard the kine singing, they looked at the ark that was on the cart: <i>They lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it</i> (ibid., v. 13). Whereupon a strong wind arose and revealed what was in the ark, and seventy thousand of them perished, as it is said: <i>And he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had gazed upon the ark of the Lord, even He smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men</i> (ibid, v. 19). Observe, therefore, how many miracles were performed because of the ark. Why did they occur? Because the Shekhinah and the Torah were within it. Wherever the Torah is present the Shekhinah accompanies it, as it is said: <i>They that feared the Lord spoke to one another; and the Lord harkened and heard</i> (Num. 13:16). Therefore the ark was more beloved than any other vessel in the Sanctuary.",

Scripture is referring in this verse to the wicked Esau. Just as the thorns from a bush that cling to a man’s garment will cling to another part of the garment when he tries to brush them off, so the government of Esau (Rome), while still collecting a crop tax from Israel, would impose a head tax. And even before the head tax was fully collected, it would impose a levy for the care of its soldiers. The Holy One, blessed be He, did not do that: <i>For the path of the upright is even</i>, made level before Israel.", 
        "15_Vaera, 12_Siman, 4_Paragraph": "Because Egypt forced Israel to neglect the Law, concerning which it is written: <i>But thou shalt meditate therein day and night</i> (Josh. 1:8), I will exact punishment from it with a fire that shall not be <i>quenched night nor day</i>. Why was fire used? Because they burned “My house from which smoke poured forth” (the Temple), as it is said: <i>And the house was filled with smoke</i> (Isa. 6:4). Therefore, <i>the smoke thereof shall go up forever</i> (ibid. 39:4). But it also says: <i>And thus the Sound of an uproar from the city</i> (ibid. 66:6). And so the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: <i>Hark, it cometh from the Temple</i>. Do you not remember what you did in the Temple? <i>Hark! The Lord rendereth recompense to His enemies</i> (ibid. 66:6). When will they be recompensed?

Just as a beautiful bride is prized above everything else, you are prized above all nations. <i>Honey and milk under thy tongue</i> (ibid. 4:11). When you devote yourself to the Torah you are consuming milk and honey, for you declared at Sinai: <i>We will do and we will hear</i>. Hence, <i>Thy lips, O my bride, drop honey</i>. Just as I called you My bride, so the Torah adorns and bedecks Israel like a bride. He gave Moses all of Israel’s adornments, the Scripture, the Mishnah, the Talmud, the laws and legends, as one gives gifts to a bride, as it is said: <i>He gave unto Moses as though she was His bride</i> (<i>kekhalto</i><sup>28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The usual English translation of this word is “when he made an end of (speaking).”</i>).<i> Tablets</i>.

Because he delayed fulfilling his vow, he was smitten by all three. How do we know about idolatry? It is written: <i>Put away the strange gods</i> (ibid. 35:2). We know about lewdness from the episode of Dinah, and about bloodshed from the fact that they killed all the males.

Moses began with the words: <i>I will sing unto the Lord</i> (Exod. 15:1), and Israel added: <i>For He is highly exalted</i>. Moses said: <i>The Lord is my strength and song</i> (ibid., v. 2), and Israel declared: <i>And He is become my salvation</i>. Moses sang: <i>The Lord is a man of war</i> (ibid., v. 3), and Israel responded with the words: <i>The Lord is His name</i>. The same procedure was followed in all the verses of the hymn. What is meant by <i>I will sing unto the Lord</i>? It implies that it is fitting to sing a song unto the Lord, to ascribe power unto the Lord, and to praise the greatness of the Lord. Thus, David said: <i>Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory</i> (I Chron. 29:11).",

Hence you too must go down, for it behooves a servant to behave like his master. When Moses heard that, he said to himself: Truly, there is no forgiveness for them. The Holy One, blessed be He, was aware of what was transpiring in Moses’ heart, and so He said to him: <i>Have I not already told thee at the thorn bush that I have surely seen</i> (Exod. 3:7)? You saw but one vision, but I have seen two. I saw them coming to Sinai and accepting My Torah, and I also saw that I would descend at Sinai on My chariot with four animals and they would examine it and unhitch one of them in order to provoke Me, as it is said: <i>And they four had the face of an ox</i>, etc. (Ezek. 1:10), and it is written elsewhere: <i>Thus they exchanged their glory for an ass that eateth grass</i> (Ps. 106:20).", 
        "3_Noach, 1_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "<i>And he that is wise winneth souls</i> (ibid.). This applies to Noah, who fed and sustained the animals. What food did he feed them? R.

He provided each of them with the kind of food it was accustomed to eat—straw for the camel, barley for the ass, and so forth. Each animal was fed what it was accustomed to eat. Hence, <i>And he that is wise winneth souls.</i>",

Draw lots to discover the guilty one. Whereupon he drew lots and the lot fell up Achan. Achan cried out: “You decided that I was guilty simply by drawing lots, but if you had drawn lots between yourself and Elazar the priest, then one of you would have been proven guilty.” Then Joshua glanced at the twelve stones on the ephod that was suspended over the heart of the high priest, and observed that the stone of the tribe of Judah had grown dim. The stones always rendered their verdict in this way. When a tribe performed a meritorious deed, its stone would sparkle and glow brightly, but if a tribe transgressed, its stone grew dim. When Joshua saw this, he said to Achan: <i>My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto him</i> (Josh. 7:19). Immediately <i>Achan answered and said: “Of a truth I have sinned.” And Joshua said: “Why hast thou troubled us?

In that way she brought about his death and, as it were, shed his blood, and the law prescribes: <i>Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed</i> (Gen. 9:6). That is why woman’s blood is made to flow. She is required to abstain from sexual relations during menstruation to atone for the blood of Adam that she was responsible for shedding.",

Moses said: <i>I learn understanding from my elders</i> (Ps. 119:100). When Isaac blessed Jacob, he said to him: <i>And God Almighty bless thee</i> (Gen. 28:3). How did he conclude his blessing? With the word <i>call</i>, as it is said: <i>And Isaac called Jacob and blessed him</i> (ibid., v. 1). And Jacob began where his father had ended, as it is said: <i>And Jacob called his sons</i> (Gen. 49:1), and concluded: <i>And this is what their father spoke to them</i>. When Moses blessed the tribes, he began where Jacob had left off, as is said: <i>And this is the blessing</i>, and he concluded with: <i>Happy, art thou, O Israel</i> (Deut. 33:29). Later, David began where Moses concluded, saying: <i>Happy is the man</i> (Ps. 1:1). Hence Scripture states: <i>I learn understanding from my elders</i> (Ps. 119:100).",

Concerning Joseph it is stated: <i>And they hated him</i> (Gen. 37:8), and about Zion: <i>She hath uttered her voice against Me, therefore I have hated her</i> (Jer. 12:8). With reference to Joseph it is said: <i>For behold, we are binding sheaves</i> (Gen. 37:7), and in regard to Zion: <i>Ye shall come home with song, bearing sheaves</i> (Ps. 126:6). It is written of Joseph: <i>Shalt thou indeed rule over us?</i> (Gen. 36:8), and of Zion: <i>That sayeth unto Zion: “Thy God reigneth”</i> (Isa. 52:7).

This righteous man went out on two occasions, and the Holy One, blessed be He, recorded them. This is one. The verse <i>He went out the second day</i> (ibid. 2:13) indicates that he went out twice. <i>And he looked upon their burdens</i>. What is the meaning of <i>And he looked</i>? He looked at the men as they labored and cried out: “Woe is me, would that I could die for them.” Though there is no labor more arduous than working with clay, he would put his shoulders to the tasks and help each one of them.

Why, then, do you allow other nations to come between us?

Why is the word <i>morning</i> repeated in the text? Because they brought all the gifts that were required for the Tabernacle in two mornings. This happened because a blessing accompanied their gifts. Hence it is stated: <i>That they take for Me… ye shall take My offering</i> (Exod. 25:2). <i>They take for Me</i>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Because I told you <i>Take for Me an offering</i>, do not scoff at the (giving of an) offering by saying: “He is not a priest that he should eat it,” for if a man fails to give him even one hundredth of his portion, let him realize that he is stealing it, not from the priestly tribe, but from Me, for so it is written: <i>That they take for Me an offering, and ye shall take My offering</i> (Exod. 25:2).",

What is the meaning of the words <i>and now</i>? They mean that though they had rebelled against Him, were contumacious, and had built a tower, the Holy One, blessed be He, stretched out His right hand toward them so that they might repent, as it is said: <i>And now, Israel, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God</i> (Deut. 10:12). But they replied: <i>Nothing will be withholden</i> (<i>yibazer</i>) <i>from them.</i> Even if those men were cut off (<i>nivzarim</i>) from the world, they would not repent, as it is said: <i>As a grape-gatherer</i> (<i>bozer</i>) <i>cutteth off the shoots</i> (Jer. 6:9).",

When Saul caused him to be brought up (by the witch of Endor), he said to the woman: “What does he look like?” And she answered: <i>An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe</i> (I Sam. 28:14). And Scripture states elsewhere: <i>Moreover, his mother made him a little robe</i> (ibid. 2:19). This teaches us that just as one departs (this life), so he will return. The reason for this is that the wicked should not say: “Some He puts to death, and others He restores to life.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Let them arise just as they departed, and then I will heal them. Why so? To confirm the verse <i>Before Me there was no God formed, neither shall any be after Me</i> (Isa. 43:10)",

Normally a powerful man is not concerned about executing his decisions in accordance with the demands of justice. In fact, he ignores justice and commits acts of violence and theft. He disregards the attitude of His Creator, favors his friends and his relatives, and acts unjustly toward his enemies. But the Holy One, blessed be He, <i>loveth justice</i>, and executes his decrees only justly. Hence it says: <i>The strength also of the King who loveth justice</i>.",

Just as Joseph comforted his brothers while they were weeping, so the Holy One, blessed be He, will redeem Israel while she weeps, as it is said: <i>They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them; I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble</i> (Jer. 31:9).",

The <i>ketiv</i> (traditional spelling) is “I shall dwell” (rather than the Masoretic “thou shalt dwell” as in the preceding quotation) to indicate that though I shall exile you from its midst, my Shekhinah will not depart from the city. The <i>field</i> mentioned here alludes only to Zion, as it is said: <i>Zion unto a field will be plowed</i> (ibid. 3:12). The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: You shall pray unto me in the direction of the Holy City, and I will hearken from heaven and heal your land. Therefore Jacob said to his sons: <i>Let us arise, and go up to Beth-El</i>. What shall we do there? they asked.

        "13_Vayechi, 2_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Another explanation as to why Jacob did not want to buried in Egypt. He was afraid that the Egyptians might use him as an object of idolatrous worship. Just as punishment is exacted from the worshipper of an idol, so is it exacted from the (idol) which is worshipped, as it is written: <i>And against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment</i> (Exod. 12:12). Similarly, you find that after Daniel interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s dream: <i>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet odors unto him</i> (Dan. 2:46). Daniel would not allow it. And why not? For just as the idolaters would be punished, so too would he be. You find this illustrated in what is written about Hiram, king of Tyre. After he proclaimed himself a god: <i>Because thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast said: I am a god</i> (Ezek. 28:2). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: <i>Art thou wiser than Daniel</i>? (ibid., v. 3). When Nebuchadnezzar decreed that offerings should be brought to him, he (Daniel) would not permit it, yet you call yourself a god.

Then, he took a lion and slaughtered it there, and after that he obtained a pig and an ape and slaughtered them in the same place. Their blood seeped into the earth, watering the vineyard. He did this to demonstrate to Noah that before drinking wine man is as innocent as a sheep: <i>Like a sheep that before her shearers is dumb</i> (Isa. 53:7). But after he drinks a moderate amount of wine he believes himself to be as strong as a lion, boasting that no one in all the world is his equal. When he drinks more than he should, he behaves like a pig, wallowing about in urine and performing other base acts. After he becomes completely intoxicated, he behaves like an ape, dancing about, laughing hysterically, prattling foolishly, and is completely unaware of what he is doing.

The fact is that the heavens are contained merely in the span of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said: <i>And meted out heaven with the span</i> (ibid. 40:12), and the earth is but a third of his span, as is said: <i>And comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure</i> (ibid.).

Her neighbors ridicule her, saying: “Repent or your husband will not return to you.” After some time he returned to her palace and ate and drank with her. Still her neighbors were not convinced that the king had become reconciled with her. However, after they experienced the fragrance of spices ascending from the house, all of them realized that he had become reconciled with her. Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, loved Israel and gave them the Torah and called then a holy nation: <i>A kingdom of priests and a holy nation</i> (Exod. 19:6). But when they sinned after forty days, the nations exclaimed: “He will not return to them.” Moses arose then and pleaded for mercy in their behalf. And He replied: <i>I have pardoned according to thy word</i> (Num. 14:20). Moses asked: Who will make it known to the nations? And He replied to him: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary</i>.

This (episode) simply teaches us that after Ishmael went astray, he was no longer concerned about him. But if this is so, what is meant by <i>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son</i>? It means that he was actually concerned (about the consequence of) Ishmael’s straying.

The second went to destroy Sodom, as it is said: <i>And he said unto him: “See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow”</i> (ibid. 19:21). It does not say “We have accepted thee, we will not overthrow,” but <i>I have accepted thee, I will not overthrow</i>, thereby indicating that this was the mission of the second one.

However, the angel consulted Sarah before administering each blow. How do we know that? We know that because it is written: <i>Because of the word of Sarai.</i> Scripture does not say “Because of” or “For the sake of” or “On account of her merit,” but simply, <i>Because of the word of Sarai.</i> If Sarah told the angel to strike him, he struck him, and if she told him to desist, momentarily, he desisted.

The punishments visited upon the first nation will also be inflicted upon Edom. In the case of Egypt, He smote it with blood, and with reference to Edom, it is said: <i>I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood</i> (Joel 3:3). In Egypt the voices of frogs were harsh, while in Edom: <i>Hark! an uproar from the city, hark! it cometh from the Temple</i> (Isa. 66:6). Gnats came upon Egypt: <i>And He smote the dust of the earth</i>, and in Edom: <i>And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and dust thereof into brimstone</i> (Isa. 34:9). In Egypt there were swarms, and in Edom: <i>The pelican and the bittern shall possess it, and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein</i> (ibid., v. 11). R. Abba the son of Kahana said: <i>Darkness</i> and <i>thick darkness</i> were used as divine agents in Egypt, but <i>void</i> and <i>waste</i> never were and never will be used. When will they be used? Against a great city in Cappadocia, as it is said: <i>And He shall stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness</i> (ibid.).", 
        "1_Introduction, 15_Paragraph": "The proem in the second type of homily, as stated above, is a halakhic question introduced by the formula <i>yelammedenu rabbenu</i>, “may our master teach us”: Is the one reciting the prayers (i.e., the Amidah, or “standing prayer”) before the ark permitted to repeat the prayers if he previously failed to recite the one that deals with heretics? Indeed, he must do so, lest the congregation come to the conclusion that he himself is a heretic (and therefore intentionally ignored the prayer about heretics). The repetition is also required if he should omit the prayer relating to the “builder of Jerusalem.” Otherwise, the congregation might think that he is a Samaritan (and therefore descended from those who opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Babylonian Exile). However, the reader of the prayers is not required to repeat any other prayer he may have omitted. The homilist then proceeds to discuss the treatment to be accorded to a prospective convert who is thoroughly familiar with the minutiae of both the Written Law (Torah) and the Oral Law (Talmud), but denies the Oneness of God. He must not be accepted into the congregation no matter how well informed in the Torah he may be. However, the stranger who abandons idolatry must be warmly welcomed into the congregation (though he may be uninformed in the Torah). Why? Because I (God) love him, as it is said: <i>And He loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment</i> (Deut. 10:18). The message of this Midrash is that God’s love extends to all who abandon idolatry and acknowledge the Oneness of God.",

The word <i>see</i> in the former verse speaks of the upper regions, and the word <i>see</i> in the latter verse refers to the terrestrial regions. Thus Scripture says: <i>So shalt thou find grace and favor in the sight of God and man</i> (Prov. 3:4).",

When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them</i> (Exod. 25:8), he replied: Master of the Universe, the heavens and the heavens of the heavens cannot contain Thee. He responded: Moses, it is not as you think. Erect twenty boards on the northern side and twenty boards on the southern side and eight on the eastern side and eight on the western side, and I will compress My Shekhinah and dwell within them; as it is written: <i>And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee</i> (ibid., v. 22).",

Joseph told the powerful men: “Carry this man into the prison, and bind his feet in chains.” As they were approaching him, Simeon let forth a roar, and when they heard the sound, they fell to the ground, and their teeth were shattered: <i>The lion roareth, and the fierce lion howleth—yet the teeth of the young lions are broken</i> (Job 4:10).",

And so you find that in the time of Ahab, Micah said: <i>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the hosts of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left</i> (I Kings 22:19). Is there a left hand on High, since it is written: <i>Thy right hand, O Lord, glorious in power; Thy right hand, O Lord, dasheth in pieces the enemy</i> (Exod. 15:16), and also: <i>The right hand of the Lord is exalted; the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly</i> (Ps. 118:16)?

He had made his brothers swear that they would cause their sons, the children of Israel, to take a vow that they would bring his body out from Egypt. Why did he compel his brothers to vow rather than his own sons? He said to himself: If I impose this vow upon my sons, the Egyptians may not permit them to fulfill it. For if they should tell the Egyptians: “Our father brought his father out of the land,” they may reply: “Your father was a king, and therefore he forced his brothers to promise to do this.”",

Likewise, they were the ones who went out to gather it up (on the Sabbath, which was forbidden), but were unable to find any (as Moses had warned). They were also the ones who participated in his (Moses’) conflict with Korah. Hence it is said: <i>It was Dathan and Abiram</i>. They were involved in wickedness from beginning to end. <i>He said to him that did wrong: “Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?”</i> (Exod. 2:13), that is to say: “Why do you strike one who is just as wicked as you are?” And they retorted: <i>Who made thee a man, ruler and judge over us?</i> This implied: “You are not yet a man, indeed you are only a lad, and yet you try to act as though you are a ruler and a judge over us.”",

However, if I tell her nothing at all, and simply steal him away from her when she is not looking, she will kill herself. What did he do? He said to Sarah: “Prepare some food and drink that we may eat and rejoice.” “But why is this day different from other days?” she asked. “What are you celebrating?” He replied: “When a couple our age has a son, it is fitting, indeed, that they should eat, drink, and rejoice.” Whereupon she prepared the food. While they were eating, he said to her: “When I was a child of three, I already knew my Creator, yet this child is growing up and still has had no instruction.

What is indicated by the word <i>Telaim</i>? When they were prosperous, he counted them by means of their lambs (<i>telayim</i>), but when they were poor in deeds, he counted them with stones. What is <i>bezek</i>? It is a stone. He took a stone for each one of them and then totaled the stones. A census was taken in the days of David, as is said: <i>Joab gave up the sum, the number of the people to the king</i> (II Sam. 24:9); and again at the time of Ezra: <i>The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand, three hundred and three score</i> (Ezra. 2:14).

Isaiah said: <i>Fury is not in Me; would that I were as the brass and thorns and flame! I would with one step burn it all together</i> (Isa. 27:4). (This verse indicates that) if I took a single step in violation of justice, I would with one step burn it completely, and the whole world would be consumed forthwith. Why does Scripture say <i>Or else take hold of My strength</i> (ibid., v. 5)? Because whatever My hand seizes with strength, My hand also seizes with justice, as it is said: <i>If I sharpen my glittering sword, My hand takes hold with justice</i> (Deut. 32:41). Yea, let him make peace for me (Isa. 27:5). That is, let him make peace between Me and the law (by fulfilling the law): <i>Let him make peace for Me</i> (ibid.).",

Levi said: If they glanced into the ark for as long as the blinking of an eye, they would have died at once. You know this is so from the fact that when the Philistines captured the ark and then sought to return it, they took the kine and hitched them in the usual way with their buttocks toward the ark, but the milch kine realized what was expected of them and turned their heads toward the ark and pushed it on the way, as is said: <i>And the kine took the straight way</i> (I Sam. 6:12).",

Our rabbis of blessed memory posed the query: What did they do when the Holy One, blessed be He, brought the waters of the deep upon them and they saw the waters beginning to gush over them? They had given birth to many children, as it is written: <i>Their seed is established</i> (<i>nakhon</i>) <i>in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes</i> (Job 21:8). In fact, this verse implies that the women would conceive at night and give birth (<i>nakhon</i>) the next morning, as it is said: <i>And would be ready</i> (<i>nakhon</i>) <i>by morning</i> (Exod. 34:2). <i>And their offspring before their eyes</i> (Job 21:8) indicates that they lived to see their great-grandchildren. Some of them took their children and stuffed them unmercifully into the crevices through which the waters gushed. Hence, it is said: <i>The mercies of the wicked are cruel.</i> How do we know that they actually did that? Job declared: <i>The womb forgetteth him; the worm feedeth sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered, unrighteousness is broken as a tree</i> (ibid. 24:20). <i>The womb forgetteth him … he shall be no more remembered</i> signifies that they pressed their own offspring into these crevices. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do to them after that? He brought the flood down upon them and destroyed them, as it is said: <i>Unrighteousness is broken as a tree</i>.<sup>13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Just as a tree is destroyed by a flood, so these unrighteous men were destroyed by the flood from above.</i>",

Their ageless popularity is attested to by the considerable number of midrashic manuscripts in our possession and by the frequency with which midrashic works have been published and republished in more recent times.

Therefore, <i>Behold, he cometh forth to meet thee</i> implies that when he told him that (Aaron would be glad) he agreed to go. Immediately the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself unto Aaron and said to him: <i>Go into the wilderness to meet Moses</i>. Hence, <i>O that thou wert as my brother</i> refers to the kind of brothers Moses and Aaron were to each other. <i>When I would find thee without, I would kiss thee</i> (Song 8:1) indicates that he met him at the mountain of the Holy One, blessed be He, and kissed him.",

What is meant by “with her permission”? It means that if she eats the food of Israelites she may nurse him.

Abraham reflected upon the matter, saying to himself: The kings that attacked the Sodomites have been slain, while they (the Sodomites) have fled, as is said; <i>And they that remained fled to the mountains</i> (ibid.). Surely if they had been unworthy, they would not have been allowed to escape. The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: The fate of those that fled is alluded to in the verse: <i>If he flee from the iron weapon, the bow of brass shall strike him through. He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; terrors are upon him; all darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not blown by man shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tent</i> (Job 20:24–26). Where was all the darkness laid up? It was in the area north of Sodom, which is at the right (south) of Jerusalem, as it is said: <i>And thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters</i> (Ezek. 16:46). What is meant by the words <i>It shall go ill with him that is left in his tent</i>? They mean that the fugitive who escaped will suffer misfortune in his tent. Who was one such?

From this you learn that everyone who devotes himself to the Torah acquires his sustenance from the Torah and becomes prosperous and successful. Thus He said to Joshua: <i>For then thou shalt make thy ways prosperous</i> (Josh. 1:8). <i>And toil addeth nothing thereto</i> indicates that it was not necessary for him to go elsewhere (to find it), for the Holy One, blessed be He, placed it in his tent.",

They would adduce arguments from the Torah, the Mishnah, and the Talmud so that the Israelites might not sin against the law, as it is said: <i>Great peace have they that love Thy law; and there is no sinning for them</i> (Ps. 119:165). Scripture informs us: <i>The Lord will give strength unto His people, the Lord will bless His people with peace</i> (Ps. 29:11).

That he gathered strength and appointed judges, and it says “And his heart was uplifted in the ways of the Lord, and he further removed the high places and the asherim from Judah.” (Chronicles II 17:6) And was he haughty of spirit, that it says ‘his heart was uplifted’?! Rather this means that he appointed judges over them who knew how to go in the ways of the Lord, and to keep the ways of the Lord, “And he said to the judges, \"See what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the Lord, and [He] is with you in the matter of the judgment. And now, may the fear of the Lord be upon you; observe and do, for with the Lord your God there is neither injustice, favoritism, nor bribe-taking.” (Chronicles II 19:6-7) And if Moshe our teacher, who was not commanded about judges but rather was told by Yitro “But you shall choose out of the entire nation…” (Exodus 21:18), nevertheless appointed a Sanhedrin, we who were commanded by the Torah “You shall set up judges and law enforcement officials for yourself…” (Deuteronomy 16:18) all the more so. And from where do we learn that Moshe appointed a Sanhedrin? As it says “Moses chose men of substance out of all Israel…” (Exodus 18:25) Even Jerusalem was only praiseworthy because of judgment, as it says “Then your name went out among the nations for your beauty…” (Ezekiel 16:14) And what is beauty? It is judgment, as it says “Neither shall you glorify a poor man in his lawsuit.” (Exodus 23:3) And Jerusalem was only destroyed because of the corruption of judgment, as it says “…whose name is so befouled, in whom the turmoil is so great.” (Ezekiel 22:5) The name which you gained at first through judgment, you befouled, and it is written “…full of justice…” (Isaiah 1:21) This is what Jeremiah said to them “The kings of the earth did not believe…for the sins of her prophets, the iniquities of her priests…” (Lamentations 4:12-13) At that hour the Holy One swore that He Himself would exact payment from them and from the judges, as it says “Therefore, says the Master, the Lord of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel…” (Isaiah 1:24) ‘Therefore’ is always the language of an oath, as it says “And, therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli…” (Samuel I 3:14) And the Mighty One (abir) means the head of the court (av bet din), as it says “…the chief of Saul's shepherds.” (Samuel I 21:8) This comes to teach you that the Holy One became the head of the court in order to exact retribution upon them.

Indeed, they insist that the phrase <i>from pursuing thy business</i> indicates that you are prohibited from pursuing your personal interests, but the question remains whether the interests of heaven are a religious duty (mitzvah) or not. Listen to what R. Eleazar said: “We may decide the allotment of charity to the poor on the Sabbath.” And R. Jacob the son of Idi stated that R.

And on that day the Holy One, blessed be He, told them: <i>Make Me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell therein</i>, so that the nations might know that He had forgiven them for the episode of the golden calf.

Hence the sons of Korah exclaimed: <i>When the earth and the inhabitants thereof trembled, I Myself established the pillars of it</i> (Ps. 75:4).

Hence, <i>Thine eyes are as doves</i>. Another explanation of <i>Thine eyes are as doves</i>. Just as the dove recognizes its mate, and does not depart from her, so Israel, when it recognizes the Holy One, blessed be He, does not stray from Him nor forsake Him. Another explanation of <i>As a dove</i>. All other birds move convulsively while being slaughtered, but the dove alone stretches out its neck.

The Holy One, blessed be He, kept them away, as it is said: <i>And unto the elders, He said: “Tarry ye here for us until we come back unto you”</i> (ibid. 24:14). In this world, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, you shall not witness the glory of the Torah, but in the world-to-come, I will reveal unto you the light of the glory of the Torah, as it is said: <i>Then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed</i> (Isa. 24:23).",

Simeon the son of Yohai said: Observe that though nothing is more precious to a man than his own son, he is required to circumcise him. Why must he do that? R. Nahman the son of Samuel said: He does so in order to fulfill the will of his Creator, and even though he witnesses his son’s blood flowing from the circumcision, he welcomes it joyfully. R. Hanina declared: And what is more, he spends his money to celebrate the occasion, something which he was not commanded (to do). Why is that so? Because Scripture states: <i>But as for me, I will hope continually, and will praise Thee yet more and more</i> (Ps. 71:14).

This tells us that the law was an inheritance for all who associate themselves with Jacob. Even outsiders who devote themselves to the law are equal to the high priest, as it is said: <i>Which if a man do, he shall live by them: I am the Lord</i> (Lev. 18:5).

The name <i>Tirathites</i> (understood as derived from Aramaic <i>tar’a</i>, “gate”) indicates that they sat at the gate to the inner chamber of the Temple; <i>Shimeathites</i> (which includes the letters of the word <i>shema</i>, “hear”) implies that all the Israelites heard the law from their lips; and <i>Succathites</i> (which includes the word <i>sukkah</i>, “covered by”) suggests that they were enveloped by the Holy Spirit. Who were these? They were Kenites who came from <i>The father of the house of Rechab</i> (ibid.). The father-in-law of Moses was a Kenite, and Shemaiah and Abtalion and the descendants of Sisera were also Kenites. They studied the law in public like the men of the Great Synagogue. Why was that?

Indeed, they are so tall that a man standing beneath them must raise his eyes to see their uppermost branches. Therefore, the righteous are compared to a palm tree and a cedar because the Holy One, blessed be He, causes them to be exalted in the world. The righteous are compared to a palm tree and a cedar for another reason. You find that when other trees grow old, they are hewn, and their sprouts, once planted, grow large quickly, but when the palm tree and the cedar are hewn down, another can be grown to replace it only after many years.

The verse <i>I will change their glory to shame</i> (Hos. 4:7) was likewise modified. In the case of <i>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job</i> (Job 32:3) they changed the text. Similarly, but <i>Abraham stood yet before the Lord</i> (Gen 18:22) is another illustration of this. Again, in the verse <i>And if Thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray Thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in Thy sight, and let me not look upon my wretchedness</i> (Num. 11:15) they changed the text. Similarly in the passage <i>Let her not, I pray, be as one head, of whom the flesh is half consumed when He cometh out of his mother’s womb</i> (ibid. 12:12) they altered the verse. And likewise, the verse <i>What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse; to your tents, O Israel; now see to thine own house, David.

Yosé the son of Hanina posed the question: What is meant by <i>The burden wherewith his mother corrected him</i>? It means that Bath-sheba turned him over a whipping post and punished him by beating him with a rod. What did she say to him as she did this? <i>What, my son? and what, O son of my womb? and what, O son of my vows?</i> (Prov. 31:2). With these words she was saying to him: “Everyone knows that your father is a God-fearing man, and if you should go astray, they will say that you are my son, and I am responsible for what you are.” <i>And what, O son of my womb?</i> “When the other women of your father’s house became pregnant, they saw the king’s face no more, but I went to him so that I might have a well-formed and powerful son.”<sup>6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was believed that cohabitation during the last three months of pregnancy affected the embryo positively but the mother negatively.

That is to say, she was telling him: “What have you to do with kings who drink wine, become drunk, and say, <i>O Lemuel</i>, what is God to us? It is not for princes to say: <i>Where is strong drink?</i> (ibid.).

If they relent (their actions), well and good; but if not, he sends barbarians against them. If they retract, good; but if not, he orders other reprisals to be taken against them.

They were not contrite, and He therefore brought tumultuous noises upon them. These were the frogs. R. Yosé the son of Hanina said: Their croaking was harder to bear than the havoc they wrought. Still they did not repent, and so he shot arrows at them. These were the gnats, as it is said: <i>And there were gnats upon man, and upon beast</i> (Exod. 8:13). They penetrated the bodies of the Egyptians like spears. However, they did not become contrite, and so He sent barbarians against them. These were the swarms, as it is said: <i>And there came grievous swarms of beasts</i> (ibid., v. 20). Still they did not relent, and so He took other reprisals against them. He brought the murrain: <i>And all the cattle of Egypt died</i> (ibid. 9:6). Nevertheless, they did not repent, and so He poured naphtha over them. These were the boils, as it is said: <i>And a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast</i> (ibid., v. 9). Still they were not contrite, and so He catapulted projectiles upon them. This was the hail. But even then they did not repent, and so he stirred up a large population against them, that is, the locusts. Even so, they did not mend their ways, and so He imprisoned them. This was the darkness, as it is said: <i>And there was a thick darkness</i> (ibid. 10:22).

That fact is that though Jethro had been the priest of idolaters, he always held idols in contempt. Jethro was convinced of their falseness and despised them. In fact he had decided to repent even prior to the arrival of Moses. He had summoned his townsmen and told them: “I have served you until now, but now I am old; select another priest.” Because he had returned the paraphernalia used in idolatrous worship, they were angry with him, and turned against him so violently that no one would speak to him, or work for him, or tend his flocks.

For example, a man who lives only thirty years may have devoted himself from his tenth year until the day of his death to the law and the commandments, while another man, who lives eighty years, may have devoted himself to the law and the commandments from his tenth year to the day of his death.

He went there and became wealthy, but when he returned without fulfilling his vow, He turned Esau against him, and Esau sought to kill him. And though Esau took the two hundred she-goats from him, Jacob did not trouble to perform his vow. Whereupon He turned the angel against him and they wrestled together, but still he did not take note, as it is said: <i>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him</i> (ibid. 32:26). It was Samael, Esau’s guardian angel, who wanted to kill him, as is said: <i>When he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh</i> (ibid., v. 27). When he still was not persuaded to fulfill his vow, the anguish occasioned by Dinah’s experience befell him, as is said: <i>And Dinah went out</i>. When he continued to refrain from carrying out his vow, the tragedy of Rachel’s death occurred, as it is said <i>And Rachel died and was buried</i> (ibid. 35:19). This confirms the opinion of R.

The Holy One, blessed be He, commanded all the Israelites to make it, so that not one of them would be able to humiliate his fellow Israelite by saying: “I contributed more for the building of the ark than you, therefore I am more learned and have a greater right to it than you do. And since you contributed little to the ark, you will have no portion in the Torah.” That is why the Torah is likened to water, as it is said: <i>Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come you for water</i> (Isa. 55:1). Just as no one should be ashamed to say to his companion: “Give me a drink of water,” no one should be ashamed to say to a person younger than himself: “Teach me the law, instruct me in this matter.” And just as one who desires to drink should be able to drink without cost, so all who desire to learn the law should be able to learn without cost and without price, as it is said: <i>Yea, come without money and without price</i> (ibid.).",

        "3_Noach, 12_Siman, 2_Paragraph": "Our teachers of blessed memory stated: While Noah was planting the vineyard, Satan appeared before him and asked: “What are you planting?” He answered: “A vineyard.” “What is it?” inquired Satan. “Its fruits are sweet, whether moist or dry,” he answered, “and from them one produces a wine that causes the heart of man to rejoice, as it is written: <i>And wine doth make glad the heart of man</i> (Ps. 104:15).” Satan suggested: “Come, let us be partners in this vineyard.” And Noah replied: “Certainly.”",

R. Simeon the son of Halafta said: What did the Israelite women do? They would go to the Nile to draw water, and the Holy One, blessed be He, would fill their jugs with little fishes.<sup>15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Small fishes arouse sexual desire (Berakhot 40a).</i> They would (sell some), cook and prepare (the fish), and buy some wine (with the proceeds of the sale), and then bring it to their husbands in the fields, as it is said: <i>In all manner of service in the field</i> (Exod. 1:14). While the men were eating and drinking, the women would take out their mirrors and glance into them with their husbands. They would say: “I am more attractive than you,” and the men would reply: “I am handsomer than you.” In that way they would arose their sexual desires and become fruitful and multiply. The Holy One, blessed be He, caused them to conceive on the spot.", 
        "21_Tetzaveh, 3_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "How important He is to us, David tells us in the verse: <i>The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?</i> (Ps. 27:1). When did David utter this verse? While fighting against the Amalekite bands. He fought against them at night and slew them, as it is said: <i>And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening</i> (I Sam. 30:17). Who indeed lit the shooting stars and sent the lightning for them? R. Eleazar the son of Pedat was of the opinion that this verse refers to the war waged against the Egyptians after they pursued the Israelites. Observe what is written there: <i>And there was the cloud and the darkness here, yet it gave light by night there</i> (Exod. 14:20). R. Oshaya declared: When the Israelites saw the light they cried out: <i>The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: If you light lamps before Me, I will illumine the world in your behalf with a great light, as it is said: <i>But the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory</i> (Isa. 16:19).",

It also says: <i>And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; an overflowing shower and great hailstones</i> (Exod. 38:22). <i>And now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle</i> (ibid. 9:19), on account of the plague of hail. He said to him: Wicked one, the Lord is righteous indeed.", 
        "24_Pekudei, 10_Siman, 10_Paragraph": "When did he tell Moses to make the Sanctuary? It was on the Day of Atonement, the tenth day of Tishri. It happened then because he ascended the mountain three times and spent one hundred and twenty days there; that is, from the sixth day of Sivan to the Day of Atonement, the tenth day of Tishri. That is the day of which it is said: <i>And the Lord repented of the evil which he said He would do unto His people</i> (Exod. 32:14) because of the episode of the golden calf. It was the day He said to him: <i>I have pardoned according to thy words</i> (Num. 14:20); it was the day He said: <i>Let them make Me a Sanctuary</i>; it was the day he asked: <i>And pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thine inheritance</i> (Exod. 34:5); on this day may You grant pardon to future generations; it was the day the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: <i>For on this day shall atonement be made for you</i> (Lev. 16:30). Hence they constructed the Tabernacle with joy and gladness.",

        "4_Lech Lecha, 18_Siman, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And I will make my covenant between Me and thee (Gen. 17:2).</b> Scripture says elsewhere in allusion to this verse: <i>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and His covenant, to make them know it</i> (Ps. 25:14). What secret did He reveal to those who feared Him? The secret of circumcision. The Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Abraham alone the mystery of circumcision. <i>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him.</i> This alludes to Abraham, for it is written about him: <i>Thou art a God-fearing man</i> (Gen. 22:12). What is the meaning of the word <i>sod</i> (“secret”)? It may be explained arithmetically. In the word <i>sod,</i> the <i>samekh</i> is sixty, the <i>vav</i> six, and the <i>dalet</i> four—totaling seventy in all. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, informed Abraham: I will produce from you seventy, as it is said: <i>Thy fathers descended to Egypt with threescore and ten persons</i> (Deut. 10:22); I will cause seventy elders to descend from them, as it is written: <i>Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel</i> (Num. 11:16); and I will also cause Moses to descend from you, and he will explain the Torah in seventy languages. Therefore, it is written: <i>The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and His covenant, to make them know it.</i>", 
        "22_Ki Tisa, 15_Siman, 1_Paragraph": "Another explanation of “made an end” (<i>kekhaloto</i>). It is written as <i>kekhalotah</i> (“like a bride”). R. Simeon the son of Lakish said: A scholar is forbidden to teach the law in a community unless the words of the Torah are as pleasing to those who hear them as a bride is pleased with her spouse and as he is eager to listen to her words. R. Levi said in the name of R. Simeon the son of Lakish: Just as a bride is adorned with twenty-four kinds of ornaments,<sup>22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So that she might be properly dressed for the wedding ceremony.</i> so a scholar must be well versed in the twenty-four books of the Torah. Another comment on <i>like a bride</i>. When a bride secludes herself in her father’s house and does not appear in public until she is about to enter the bridal chamber, she indicates thereby: “Let anyone who knows anything against me come and testify,” so too a scholar must be retiring and well known for his good deeds.", 
        "22_Ki Tisa, 26_Siman, 3_Paragraph": "<i>And it came to pass that everyone that sought the Lord went out</i> (ibid., v. 7). “Everyone who sought Moses” is not written here but rather <i>everyone that sought the Lord</i>. Because of this they said: One should greet an elderly person as one greets the Shekhinah, as it is said: <i>And it came to pass that everyone that sought the Lord went out</i>. Even the angels, the seraphim, and the bands of angels sought Him out, saying to each other: He is in the dwelling of Moses. And it came to pass: <i>When Moses entered into the tent, the pillar of clouds descended, and stood at the door of the tent</i> (ibid., v. 9). When they observed that the Shekhinah had revealed Himself to Moses, all the people arose and prayed. <i>And the Holy One spoke unto Moses face to face</i> (ibid., v. 11). We do not know whether the humble one lifted himself or whether the Exalted One lowered Himself. Said R. Joshua the son of Levi: The Great One of the World inclined Himself, so to speak, since it is said: <i>And the Lord went out unto the Tent of Meeting</i> (ibid., v. 7).", 
        "13_Vayechi, 9_Siman, 21_Paragraph": "<i>His eyes shall be red with wine</i> (Gen. 49:12). You learn from this verse that he devoted himself to the study of the Torah. The word <i>hakhlili</i> (red) should be read as <i>hekh li li</i> (“it is tasty to me”), that is, the wine of the Torah is sweet to me. <i>And His teeth white with milk</i> (ibid.). That is, if they should sin, they shall be made as white as snow, because of the Torah (they study).",

The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: Remember that I gave you the Torah, in which is written: <i>These are the statutes and commandments. To have respect of persons in judgment is not good</i>. What is meant by this? If a judge acts differentially toward a particular witness and perverts the law because of him, the Shekhinah departs (from him), for it is written: <i>The Lord is good to all</i> (Ps. 145:9). Because of that it is written: <i>God standeth in a congregation of God; in the midst of judges He judgeth</i> (ibid. 82:1).",

That is, the fool says everything he has to say at one time, while quarreling with his neighbor, and the wise man eventually is able to refute him. <i>A fool spendeth all his spirit</i> refers to the wicked Pharaoh, while <i>a wise man stilleth it within him</i> alludes to Moses and Aaron, as it is written: <i>But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods</i> (Exod. 7:12). <i>Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron</i>, etc. (Exod. 7:9). Aaron will perform all the miracles while you stand by like a prince who instructs the elders and they do it. Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses at the bush: <i>He shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him in God’s stead</i> (ibid. 4:16).",

Scripture states elsewhere in reference to this verse: <i>Dominion and fear are with Him; He maketh peace in His high places</i> (Job 25:2). In this instance, <i>dominion</i> refers to Michael, and <i>fear</i> alludes to Gabriel.<sup>9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Michael is the announcing angel, Gabriel, the prince of angels.</i> Though Michael was fashioned from water, and Gabriel was formed out of fire, when they stood in the presence of the Holy Spirit they did not affect each other adversely. Hence it says: <i>He maketh peace in His high places</i>.",

They were Nebuchadnezzar, Evil-Merodach, and Belshazzar. However, when these came to power they blasphemed, and so the Holy One, blessed be He, destroyed them and caused others to arise in their place. The rabbis said: <i>Righteousness exalteth a nation</i> refers to the free-will gifts that Israel brought to the Temple. Therefore He granted them forgiveness through Moses. And He said: <i>When thou takest the sum</i>.",

You must not assert: “I am prosperous, why should I pray now? But when troubles beset me, I will pray.” Even before trouble comes to you, anticipate its coming by praying. R. Eleazar said: It is written in the Book of Ben Sira: “Honor your physician even before you require his services.”",
