As well as Tani Rabbi Chaya, there is no yeshiva for help but only the kings of Beth David. My mother's rabbi by the name of Rish Lakish said there was no yeshiva for help but a place for the kings of the house of David. And yes he says and David sits down. And yet a fraudulent rabbi named Rabbi Ishmael said there was no sitting upstairs that was said (Daniel 7:14) a kinship on one of the Kamia. Who do not have a leg jump. Said (Ezekiel 1: 7) with their feet straight. And spelling (Isaiah and B) resins stand above him. And spell (Zechariah 3: 3) and I gave you moves between these stands.

        "6_Psalm, 0_Comment": "<b> A <i>shigayyon</i> of David. </b> (Psalm 7:1) — This is what the verse (Ecclesiastes 10:20) says: <i> Even among those you know, do not curse the king... </i>  Don't curse a king in your generation, and don't curse a wealthy man in your generation. <i> ...for the bird of heaven will bring the voice... </i> Said Rabbi Yirmiyah: \"This is the raven and the knowledge of augury.\" <i>...and the winged one will tell the matter.</i> on account of that the walls have ears. The Holy Blessed One said to David, \"Why are you cursing My annointed one?\" <b> All my enemies will be ashamed and terrified </b> (Psalm 6:11). Who are your enemies? Is it not Saul? As you said <i>on the day the LORD saved him from the hand of... Saul</i> (Psalm 18:1)\" He said before him, \"Master of the universe, do not hold mistakes [<i>shegagot</i>] against me like brazen deeds! (Psalm 19:13) \"Mistakes [<i>shegiy'ot</i>] who can understand? ",
        "7_Psalm, 1_Comment": "\"The LORD is our Master, how mighty is Your Name in all the earth.\" Rav said: \"We find three places where the angels prosecuted God; the creation of man, the tabernacle, and the giving of the Torah.\" Where do we find [this phenomenon] regarding man? When God wished to create man he consulted the angels as it says (Genesis 1:26) \"Let Us make man.\" They began to say \"What is man that you recall him?!\" [God] replied \" Tomorrow you'll see how smart he is.\" When He created man what did God do? He brought all animals before the angels and asked them the names of all the animals and they did not know. God said to them \"Do you want to know the wisdom of Man? I will ask him and he will tell me what all their names.\" What did God do? He brought all the animals and birds before Adam as it says (ibid. 2:19) \"And the LORD formed from the earth.\" Rabbi Acha said, Did it not already say (ibid. 1:25) \"And God made the beasts of the land?\" What does the word \"and He formed\" come to teach us? Rather there it says \"and He made\" i.e. created them and here it says יצר from the root that connotes convergence as in (Deuteronomy 20:19) \"when you besiege a city. (Genesis 2:19) \"And He came to Adam to see what to call them\" Isn't God omniscient? Rather \"to see\" means \"to show the angels Adam's wisdom [by showing what Adam would call them],\" and Adam independently came up with the same name as God for each and every animal. Then God asked him, \"And you, what is your name?\" He replied, \"it is appropriate to call me Adam because I was created from the earth (Adamah).\" God asked, \"And what's My name?\" Adam replied \"It is appropriate to call you the LORD because you are the Lord of the entire world.\" That is why He says (Isaiah 42:8) \"I am the LORD, this is My name.\"",
        "8_Psalm, 8_Comment": "<b>The enemy ends their ruins forever (Psalm 9:6):</b> The enemies end, but their ruins continue forever. For instance, Constantine built Constantinople, Philippus built Philippi, Antiochus built Antioch, Alexader built Alexandria, Seleucus built Seleucia. They ended, but their ruins continue. And You, in a sense, <b> destroyed their cities. </b> Zion and Jerusalem Your Holy City have become as a desert wilderness. (See Isaiah 64:9) <b> Their monikers, they are lost. But the LORD forever abides. </b> Another interpretation of <b> The enemy ends their ruins </b> — like Caesaria and Rome. <b> and their cities You destroyed </b> \"<i>if Edom says, We are crushed...\"</i> (Malachi 1:4)  etc. Philippos asked Rabbi Elasa: \"How could the prophet say <i>if Edom says, We are crushed, they may rebuilt but I will destroy</i> (ibid.), when look, all the cities we built persist!\" He said to him, \"No, the point of the verse isn't against the buildings but rather against the foresight. For whether you sit and plan in your hearts to build up against us to destroy us, he will destroy your foresight.\" He said to him \"By your life! Thus we sit every year to destroy you, and one would fall and come and be annuled for us!\"",
        "17_Psalm, 4_Comment": "Another opinion. “The words of this song…” (Shmuel II 22:1) R’ Simon said: not all who say song say it. Rather, anyone for whom a miracle is done that then recites a song it is known that all their sins are forgiven and they become a new creation. Israel - when a miracle was done for them and they recited a song, all of their sins were forgiven, as it says “Then Moses caused Israel to set out…” (Shemot 15:22) He caused them to move on from their sins, “…from the Red Sea…” as it says “…they rebelled at the sea, at the Sea of Reeds.” (Psalms 106:7) So to you find in the days of Devorah and Barak – a miracle was done for them and they recited a song, as it says “On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang…” (Shoftim 5:1) And from where do we learn that their sins were forgiven? Right after her song it says “Then the Israelites did what was offensive to the LORD…” (Shoftim 6:1) R’ Abahu said in the name of R’ Aba: everywhere else it is written ‘And the children of Israel continued to do evil…’ but after the song of Devorah it sis written ‘Then the Israelites did…’ which implies the beginning of an act. What happened to their earlier actions? It must be that the Holy One forgave them at the moment they recited a song. So too you find with David, that a miracle was done for him and he recited a song. And from where do we know that his sins were forgiven? Because it is written after his song “These are the last words of David…” (Shmuel II 23:1) And these are the first?! Rather it comes to teach us that the Holy One forgave him for the past.",
        "18_Psalm, 10_Comment": "Another interpretation: <b>The teaching of the LORD is innocent.</b> (Psalm 19:8) — When is it innocent? When it comes from a innocent mouth. And when is it trustworthy? When it comes from a trustworthy mouth. Rabbi Tanḥuma interpreted it as the six order of the Mishnah. <b>The teaching of the LORD is innocent</b> refers to the order of Women. <b>The testimony of the LORD is trustworthy</b> (ibid.) refers to the order of Seeds, which trusts in the life of the word and sows seeds. <b>The awe of the LORD is pure</b> (Psalm 19:10) refers to the order of Purities, which distinguishes between impure and pure.",
        "18_Psalm, 11_Comment": "<b>The precepts of the LORD are straightforward, making the heart rejoice</b> (Psalm 19:9) refers to the order of Festivals, which has in it the sukkah, lulav, and festivals. As it is written in it, <b>And you will rejoice in your festivals.</b> (Deuteronomy 16:14). <b>The commandment of the LORD is clear</b> (Psalm 19:9) refers to the order of Holinesses, which clarifies the eyes to holy things. <b>The judgements of the LORD are true and correct together</b> (Psalm 19:10) refers to the order of Damages, which has in it all the judgements.

        "18_Psalm, 12_Comment": "Another interpretation: <b>The precepts of the LORD are straightforward</b> (Psalm 19:9) — Taught Ḥizkiyah son of Ḥiyyah, these are words of Torah, which are a crown for the head, as it is said <b>For a graceful wreath are they on your head, a necklace on your throat.</b> (Proverbs 1:9). A remedy for the heart — <b>making the heart rejoice</b>. A salve for the eyes — <b>The commandment of the LORD is clear, illuminating the eyes.</b> An elixir for plague — <b>Cure for your gut it will be</b> (Proverbs 3:8).

        "18_Psalm, 13_Comment": "<b>The awe of the LORD is pure</b> (Psalm 19:10) — said Rabbi Levi, since Aaron would revere the Name, as it is written <b>And I gave to him awe and he revered Me.</b> (Malachi 2:5) thus a single section of the Torah was given to him, which will not move from his sons or his sons' sons until the end of all generations. And which is this? The portion of the dead, to not be defiled by death. As it written, <b>Say to the priests the children of Aaron...</b> (Leviticus 21:1). <b>And correct together</b> (Psalm 19:10) — R. Shim'on son of Laqish said, \"Correct by means of an <i>a fortiori</i>.\" But the rabbis said, \"Correct by means of a verbal analogy.\"",

Solomon came and explained. <b>In his shade I delighted and sat.</b> (Song of Songs 2:3) <b>In guarding them is much reward [<i>eqev rav</i>]</b> (Psalms 19:12) — anyone who guards the Torah is made a rabbi [<i>rav</i>]. Another interpretation: anyone who guards the Torah to its end [<i>eqev</i>] is a rabbi [<i>rav</i>], and we open doors for him.",
        "21_Psalm, 12_Comment": "<b>And You are holy, seated on the praises of Israel.</b> (Psalms 22:4) Said R. Shmuel: every laudation and laudation with which Israel lauds the Holy Blessed One, divine Glory sits among them, as it is written, <b>And You are holy, seated on the praises of Israel.</b> Esther said, If You do not answer us, and they destroy us, I will immediately say You are <b>seated on the praises of Israel.</b> And if you save us, then <b>You are holy</b>. In eather case, You are seated on the praise of Israel. Said Rabbi Yehoshua son of Laqish: All this and more upon me if I ever looked in a book of aggadah in all my days! One time I found a book of aggadah. I saw in it 175 portions that were written in the Torah, statements and orders, corresponding to the 175 years of our father Abraham. As it is written, <b>You take the gifts of the man</b> (Psalm 68:10) — this is Abraham, as it is written, <b>the man was great among the Anakites</b> (Joshua 14:15). And 147 psalms in the book of Psalms, corresponding to the years of Jacob our father, which is the meaning behind <b>And You are holy, seated on the praise of Israel</b> (Psalms 22:4). And 123 times after the Hallel reader reads we respond \"Hallelujah!\" corresponding to the years of Aaron, which is the meaning behind <b>Revere the LORD, His holy ones!</b> (Psalm 34:10), which is Aaron who was called holy, as it is written, <b>and Aaron, the holy one of God</b> (Psalm 106:16). Rabbi Shmuel said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: over each and every praise that Israel lauds, You are far above all laudation, as it is written, <b>and high over all blessing and praise</b> (Nehemiah 9:5). Rabbi Berechia in the name of Rabbi Levi said: It is written, <b>And the LORD appeared to him in the oaks of Mamre, and he sat at the entrance to the tent</b> (Genesis 18:1). It's written that he sat?! He went to stand, but the Holy Blessed One said. \"Be seated. This is a sign that your children, at the time when Israel goes to their synagogues and study halls and recites the Shema and prays, they are seated, but My Glory stands among them,\" which is the meaning of <b>God stands guard in the congregation of God</b> (Psalm 82:1). Rabbi Ḥaggai in the name of Rabbi Yitsḥaq said, \"<b>God stands</b> isn't written there, but as <b>stands guard in the congregation</b>, as it is said, <b>And it will be, as soon as they call, I will answer</b> (Isaiah 65:24).",

        "26_Psalm, 2_Comment": "...Another explanation. 'The LORD is my light and my help...' My light by the sea, as it says \"...and it lit up the night...\" (Exodus 14:20) And my help by the sea, as it says \"...Stand by, and witness the deliverance which the LORD will work for you...\" (ibid. v. 13) Whom should I fear? \"But Moses said to the people, “Have no fear!\" (ibid.) The LORD is the stronghold of my life, \"The LORD is my strength and might...\" (Exodus 15:2) Whom should I dread? \"Terror and dread descend upon them...\" (ibid. v. 16) When evil men assail me, \"As Pharaoh drew near...\" (Exodus 14:10) To devour my flesh, \"...My desire shall have its fill of them...\" (Exodus 15:9) R' Shmuel bar Nachmani said: the wicked do not leave this world until they announce their own verdict upon themselves. This is what is written \"I will pursue, I will overtake\" (ibid.) It does not then say 'we will divide' but rather \"I will divide the spoil\" (ibid.) I will be divided. It is they, my foes and my enemies, who stumble and fall, \"Who hurled Pharaoh and his army into the Sea of Reeds...\" (Psalms 136:15) From here forward Israel said 'Should an army besiege me...' meaning the army of Egypt, '...my heart would have no fear.' 'should war beset me, because of this would I be confident.' 'This' always refers to Torah, as it says \"This is the Teaching...\" (Deuteronomy 4:44) The rabbis explained this verse as referring to Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur. 'my light,' on Rosh Hashanah. 'And my help ,' on Yom Kippur. 'When evil men assail me,' this refers to the idolaters. 'To devour my flesh,' when they come to accuse Israel and say before the Holy One: these (meaning themselves) are idolaters and those (meaning Israel) are idolaters as well! 'my foes and my enemies,' the numerical value of the letters of hasatan (the accuser) is 364. Every day of the year he has the authority to make accusations, except on Yom Kippur (and Rosh Hashanah). For this reason Israel said 'Should an army besiege me,' meaning the idolatrous nations, 'my heart would have no fear.' 'Should war beset me, because of this would I be confident,' R' Levi said: because of the bequest which you wrote in the Torah \"Thus only shall Aaron enter the Shrine...\" (Vayikra 16:3)",
        "50_Psalm, 1_Comment": " \"For You, You alone, have I sinned . . . That You may be justified when You speak\" (Ps. 51:6). To whom may David be compared? To a man who broke a limb, and came to a doctor. The doctor marveled and said: \"How great is thy break! I am much distressed on your account.\" The man with the broken limb said: \"Art you distressed on my account? Was not my limb broken for your sake, since the fee is to be yours?\" Just so David said to the Holy One, blessed be He: For You, You only, have I sinned: If You receive me, then if You say to transgressors \"Why haven't you repented?\" all transgressors will submit to You, for all of them will behold me [David], and I shall surely bear witness that You receive the penitent. Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said: Behold, I have given him [David] for a witness to the peoples (Isa. 55:4). And God gave as a witness not only me, David, but all Israel, since it is said You are My witnesses, said the Lord, and My servant whom 1 have chosen (Isaiah 43:10).",
        "104_Psalm, 0_Comment": "'Give thanks to G-d, call out His name'.

        "104_Psalm, 7_Comment": "\"Egypt rejoiced at their departure\" (Psalms 105:38) Rabbi Berchiah said: this can be compared to a corpulent man that was riding on a donkey. The donkey hopes, \"When will he get down from me?!\" and [the man] himself hopes, \"When will I get off the donkey?!\". When he gets down, the man rejoiced and the donkey rejoices. But I don't know who is happier. Such was it when Israel was in Egypt. The plagues were coming on the Egyptians and the Egyptians were hoping, \"When will Israel go out?!\" And Israel was hoping, \"When will the Holy One Blessed Be He redeem us?\" When they were redeemed, both these and these were happy, but we don't know who was happier. From what David said: \"Egypt rejoiced at their departure\", we know that Egypt was happier.",
        "109_Psalm, 0_Comment": "o\t“Of David. A psalm. The LORD said to my lord, “Sit at My right hand…” This is what the verse says “Who awakened one from the east whom righteousness met wherever he set his foot?” (Isaiah 41:2) The nations of the world we as if asleep, failing to take shelter beneath the wings of the Divine presence. Who awakened them to come and take shelter? Avraham, as it says: Who awakened one from the east. And not only the nations, but even righteousness itself was sleeping until Avraham awakened it. How did Avraham do this? He made an inn and opened doors in every direction in order to receive all those passing by, as it says “He planted a tamarisk (eshel) at Beer-sheba…” (Genesis 21:33) R’ Azaria said: what is this eshel (אשל)? It is an acronym for eating (אכילה), drinking (שתייה) and escorting one’s guests (לוייה). This is “righteousness met wherever he set his foot…”",
        "117_Psalm, 15_Comment": "H' has chastised me greatly. Chastisements are to be loved, because they please (martzin) like sacrifices. For of sacrifices [Scripture] says: \"that it may be pleasing (nirtzah) in his behalf, to atone for him.\" (Lev. 1:4) And of chastisements it is written: \"as a father is pleased with (yirtzeh) the son.\" (Prov. 3:12) Another interpretation: Chastisements are to be loved, because they are more pleasing than sacrifices. Sin offerings and guilt offerings atone only for that [particular] transgression, as it is said: \"that it may be pleasing (nirtzah) in his behalf, to atone for him.\" (Lev. 1:4) But chastisements atone for all [sins]. That is, H' has chastised me greatly [for all my sins, so my atonement is complete].",
        "117_Psalm, 16_Comment": "Open for me the gates of righteousness. In the next world [He] says to a person: What was your occupation? And he says: I fed the hungry. They say to him: Th[ere] is the gate of one who feeds the hungry; enter it. Another says: I gave water to the thirsty; and they say to him: Th[ere] is the gate of one who gives water to the thirsty; enter it. And the same for one who clothes the naked, and one who raises orphans and one who is charitable; and so with all the mitzvot. David said: I did all of the[se things]; open all of them for me. Therefore he says: Open for me the gates of righteousness so that I may enter them.",
        "148_Psalm, 0_Comment": "An earthly king has dukes and viceroys who share with him in the burden of rule, and thus also share in the honor with which he is honored. But not so with The Holy Blessed One. God has no duke and no viceroy and no lieutenant. No other does God's work, only God alone. No other bears the burden, only God alone. Therefore, only God alone is to be praised."
