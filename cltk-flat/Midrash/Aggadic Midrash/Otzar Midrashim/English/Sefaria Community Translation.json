        "32_The Order of Arakim, 1_, 0_Chapter, 11_Paragraph": "The Holy One created twenty-two good attributes in His world. All of them were nullified and in the future the Holy One will return them to Israel in the time to come. They are: four for the first man, four for the generation of the flood, one for the generation of the dispersion, two for Sodom, six in the wilderness, six for Jerusalem, on for the ten tribes…Six for Jerusalem. First, the Gihon spring comes out from Jerusalem and waters the land of Israel. Hezekiah stood up and saw with his holy spirit and said: I know that Israel will be exiled from their land and the House will be destroyed, and if the Gihon remains in its place all the nations will come to here. He rose up and sealed it off, as it says \"And he-Hezekiah-stopped up the source of the waters of the upper Gihon…\" (Chronicles II 32:30) In the future the Holy One will return it to Israel and water their land, as it says \"…and a spring shall emanate from the house of the Lord…\" (Joel 4:18) Second, prophecy was given to them and then hidden away. In the future the Holy One will return it to Israel, to make every member of Israel a prophet, as it says \"And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh…\" (Joel 3:1) Third, the priesthood was given to them and then hidden away. In the future the Holy One will return the high priesthood to Israel, as it says \"And you shall be called the priests of the Lord…\" (Isaiah 61:6) Fourth, the Sanhedrin and advisers were given to them and when a case came before them they would write the judgment on a piece of paper and place it in the ark, and an angel would descend in the night to absolve the innocent and convict the guilty. In the morning they would look at the paper and declare the judgment. In the future the Holy One will return them to Israel, as it says \"And I will restore your judges as at first and your counsellors as in the beginning…\" (Isaiah 1:26) Fifth, the Messiah was born and then hidden away. In the future the Holy One will console Israel with the Messiah, as it says \"There I shall cause David's horn to sprout…\" (Psalms 132:17) Sixth, Jerusalem was given to them and when they became corrupt it was destroyed. In the future the Holy One will rebuild it and gather Israel back in, as it says \"The Lord is the builder of Jerusalem; He will gather the outcasts of Israel.\" (Psalms 147:2)"
