        "154_Baraita of Rabbi Pinchas Ben Yair, 1_, 0_Chapter, 36_Paragraph": "“And of Benjamin he said, The Lord's beloved…” (Devarim 33:12) One verse says “As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out…” (Yehoshua 15:63) and another verse says “And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem…” (Shoftim 1:21) If it was Benyamin then why does it mention Yehudah, and if it was Yehudah then why does it mention Benyamin? Rather, inside Jerusalem were two cities – the upper and the lower. The upper one fell out within the allotment of Yehudah and the lower one within the allotment of Benyamin, as it says “And Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite, which is Jerusalem…” (Yehoshua 18:28) After the death of Yehoshua, the children of Yehudah went and took their portion, putting the city to fire and leaving it desolate. But the lower city of Jerusalem was in the portion of Benyamin, and they were not willing to drive out the inhabitants. Therefore it stood until the time of David, as it is written ‘And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites.’ This refers to the lower city, as it says in the book of Shoftim “But the man did not want to lodge, and he arose and departed, and came over against Jebus, which was Jerusalem… And his master said to him, \"We will not turn aside into (this) city of heathens…” (Shoftim 19:10-12) Furthermore, this is the city which David fought against in the eight year of his reign, as it says “And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites…” (Shmuel II 5:6) When David captured it he began to build the upper city of Jerusalem and he built a wall which surrounded the upper and lower portions and made them into one city called Jerusalem, as it says “And he built the city from around…” (Divre HaYamim I 11:8) There he placed the tent for the Ark of the Covenant, and in that Jerusalem David built the altar on the threshing floor of Arvana the Jebusite by command of Gd in order to stop the plague, as it says “And the angel of the Lord said to Gad…” (Divre HaYamim I 21:18) In the lower Jerusalem, which was in the portion of Benyamin, the Holy Temple was built in the days of Shlomo in order to fulfill that which it says “And of Benjamin he said, The Lord's beloved…” (Devarim 33:12) Mount Moriah is Jerusalem, as it says “And Solomon commenced to build the House of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah…” (Divre HaYamim II 3:1) May it desirable before my Gd and the Gd of my fathers that the Holy Temple be rebuilt speedily in ou days, and make our portion in your Torah. Amen, selah!",

All of them were nullified and in the future the Holy One will return them to Israel in the time to come. They are: four for the first man, four for the generation of the flood, one for the generation of the dispersion, two for Sodom, six in the wilderness, six for Jerusalem, on for the ten tribes…Six for Jerusalem. First, the Gihon spring comes out from Jerusalem and waters the land of Israel. Hezekiah stood up and saw with his holy spirit and said: I know that Israel will be exiled from their land and the House will be destroyed, and if the Gihon remains in its place all the nations will come to here. He rose up and sealed it off, as it says \"And he-Hezekiah-stopped up the source of the waters of the upper Gihon…\" (Chronicles II 32:30) In the future the Holy One will return it to Israel and water their land, as it says \"…and a spring shall emanate from the house of the Lord…\" (Joel 4:18) Second, prophecy was given to them and then hidden away. In the future the Holy One will return it to Israel, to make every member of Israel a prophet, as it says \"And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh…\" (Joel 3:1) Third, the priesthood was given to them and then hidden away. In the future the Holy One will return the high priesthood to Israel, as it says \"And you shall be called the priests of the Lord…\" (Isaiah 61:6) Fourth, the Sanhedrin and advisers were given to them and when a case came before them they would write the judgment on a piece of paper and place it in the ark, and an angel would descend in the night to absolve the innocent and convict the guilty. In the morning they would look at the paper and declare the judgment. In the future the Holy One will return them to Israel, as it says \"And I will restore your judges as at first and your counsellors as in the beginning…\" (Isaiah 1:26) Fifth, the Messiah was born and then hidden away. In the future the Holy One will console Israel with the Messiah, as it says \"There I shall cause David's horn to sprout…\" (Psalms 132:17) Sixth, Jerusalem was given to them and when they became corrupt it was destroyed. In the future the Holy One will rebuild it and gather Israel back in, as it says \"The Lord is the builder of Jerusalem; He will gather the outcasts of Israel.\" (Psalms 147:2)",

A slave dresses his master, but the Holy One dresses Israel, as it says “And I clothed you with embroidered garments…” (Yechezkel 16:10) A slave washes his master, but the Holy One washes Israel, as it says “And I washed you with water…” (Yechezkel 16:9) A slave places the shoes on his master, but the Holy One shoed Israel, as it says “…and I shod you with the skin of the badger…” (Yechezkel 16:10) And beyond all this, when they were exiled to Egypt the Divine Presence was with them, as it says “I will go down with you to Egypt…” (Bereshit 46:4) When they were exiled to Elam the Divine Presence was with them, as it says “And I will place My throne in Elam…” (Yirmiyahu 49:38) They were exiled to Bavel and the Divine Presence went with them, as it says “Because of you, I sent to Babylon…” (Yeshayahu 43:14) In the future the Holy One will return Israel to His holy mountain, as it says “I will bring them to My holy mount…” (Yeshayahu 56:7) and it is written after this “And I will plant them on their land…” (Amos 9:15) Since Moshe saw the love of the Holy One for Israel he said before Him ‘Master of the World! Bring them and plant them there and let that planting be complete, which will never be uprooted. Bring down Jerusalem from the heavens and let it never be destroyed. Gather together there the exiled of Israel and let them settle upon the land in security. This is why it says “You shall bring them and plant them on the mount of Your heritage, directed toward Your habitation, which You made, O Lord; the sanctuary, O Lord, [which] Your hands founded.” (Shemot 15:17)",

He donned His tallit and wrapped Himself in His light and lit up the world as it says, “[You] enwrap Yourself with light like a garment…” (Tehillim 104:2) All that day the waters covered the land and it was dissolving until He donned the garments of majesty and His glory was seen as it says, “The Lord has reigned; He has attired Himself with majesty…” (Tehillim 93:1) And He girded Himself with a belt of might and established it through His might as it says, “…He has girded Himself with might. The world also is established that it cannot be moved.” (ibid.)\n",
