        "10_Kedoshim, 15_Chapter 12, 0_Paragraph": "\"I have set you apart from the nations to be Mine.\" If you are set apart, you are Mine, and if you are not set apart, you are not Mine but of Nebuchadnezzar and his associates. Rabbi Elazar Ben Azaria says, from whence do we know that a person should not say, \"I do not wish to eat of shaatnez [flax with linen], I do not wish to eat swine meat, I do not wish to have adulterous relations\" but rather a person should say, \"I certain wish to, but what can I do that my Father in Heaven has decreed upon me?\" The verse says: \"I have set you apart from the nations to be Mine.\" And thus, he will separate himself from sin, and accept the yoke of heaven."
