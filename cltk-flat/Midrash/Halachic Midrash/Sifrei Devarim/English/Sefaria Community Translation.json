        "226_Piska, 14_Paragraph": "[Variantly: \"Send\": Scripture speaks of a clean bird. — But perhaps it speaks of an unclean bird too? It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 14:11) \"Every clean bird you may eat\": This is a prototype, viz.: Wherever \"bird\" is mentioned in Scripture, a clean bird is understood (unless specified otherwise) as R' Yoshia has stated.
