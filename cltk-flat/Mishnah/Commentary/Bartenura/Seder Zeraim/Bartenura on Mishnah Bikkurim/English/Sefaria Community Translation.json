And in the same way, if the plant stands in the field of his neighbor or in the <i>birshut harabim</i>, and the top of the shoot comes out in his field; [in these cases] he does not bring, as explained next (Mishnah 2),  because not all the growth is in his land.",

But <i> maaser sheni</i> or <i>bikkurim</i> that become mixed with <i>chullin</i> outside of Yerushalaim are not forbidden irrespective of the relative quantities, because it takes effort to bring them up [to Yerushalaim], and as such are not defined as something for which there is reason to allow.",
