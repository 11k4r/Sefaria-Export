The word has also been connected with σχολη (Page:27), schola, with elision of the first letter. Other suggested explanations are given by Abrahams, p. clix. For a description of the Kallah, see J. E. I. pp. 146 f. Although the hall was not overcrowded, yet the audience would feel crushed. This was due to the evil spirits who wished to make them uncomfortable and induce people to stay away. ",
