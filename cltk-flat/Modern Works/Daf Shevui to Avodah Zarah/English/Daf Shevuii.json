        "5_Daf, 14_Comment": "Introduction<br>The Talmud now moves to other related discussions.", 
        "6_Daf, 7_Comment": "This is another version of how God treats Israel differently than he does the non-Jews. This derashah hearkens back to the verse from Job from above.", 
        "2_Daf, 9_Comment": "Introduction<br>This section begins a long aggadah in which the nations come in front of God at the end of days and God judges them for their failings. In a sense, the aggadah’s purpose is to explain why the Torah was given to Israel and not to the other nations.", 
        "7_Daf, 0_Comment": "How could Bilaam know God, but not even understand his own animal. This leads to a reconstruction of Bilaam’s discussion with his famous donkey. Each passage is based on the donkey saying a verse back to Bilaam.", 
        "5_Daf, 18_Comment": "People are like fish and Torah is like water. We cannot live without Torah.", 
        "7_Daf, 3_Comment": "This statement is here because it again connects with the Bilaam and with God’s wrath. Note that “Israel’s enemies” is a euphemism. The statement should read “none would have remained in Israel.” But the copyist did not even want to write such a terrible statement.", 
        "5_Daf, 9_Comment": "The well-known verse from Psalms means that God will not forget Jerusalem. But it does not mean that God will no longer experience joy or laughter.", 
        "8_Daf, 4_Comment": "The sins a person commits in this world are inextricably tied to them, and accompany them like a dog in the world to come. Note that while “dog” has positive connotations for most of us, it is probably not a positive image in the Talmud.", 
        "2_Daf, 7_Comment": "The problem is that the verse from Isaiah does not refer to idolaters. The word “testimonies/witnesses” refers to Israelites.", 
        "4_Daf, 18_Comment": "The non-Jews go out and make sukkot, but God causes it to be so hot that they tear them down immediately. There is a pun being made on this verse—the last word is “עבות” which is also used in Psalms 118:27, which is connected in rabbinic thought with Sukkot.", 
        "4_Daf, 4_Comment": "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, God said that the heavens and the earth would testify that Israel has observed the Torah. Today’s section begins with the response of the nations. ", 
        "5_Daf, 15_Comment": "With a small emendation, the verse can be made to read, “They who break away from the table to idle gossip, will have roots of juniper as their food.”", 
        "4_Daf, 9_Comment": "How can God offer a mitzvah to the nations to perform in the world to come? According to a very common Jewish idea, the mitzvoth are to be performed in the here and now, today. The end of days is when people will be rewarded for their performance, but by that point it is too late to actually perform them. ", 
        "3_Daf, 14_Comment": "The nations respond to God by saying that they were not even offered the Torah. This claim gets to the heart of a theological problem—how could the nations be judged for not keeping the Torah when it was never given to them. This in essence leads to a counter-midrash. The nations were offered the Torah but none accepted it. This is one answer to that problem. However, within our sugya, we now have two contradictory answers. Were they offered the Torah and did not observe it? Or was it never offered to them?", 
        "4_Daf, 8_Comment": "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, God offers the nations the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah of the sukkah, even though the end of days is already here. Today’s section asks whether mitzvoth can be fulfilled at the end of days. Or is it too late then.", 
        "4_Daf, 1_Comment": "R. Meir uses the fact that the verse uses the word, “a man,” by that implying any man, to teach that non-Jews receive reward for the Torah they study and the mitzvot they perform. We should note that this sugya is a great example of the multi-vocality of the Talmud. Within a few lines of text we have two diametrically opposed positions. The Talmud will harmonize these views but this does not negate the fact that both are allowed room to exist.", 
        "3_Daf, 12_Comment": "The aggadah mentions Rome and Persia as the most important because their reign, according to rabbinic thought, will last until the end of days. I’m not sure history bore this out. Christianity inherited Rome, but the Vatican does not really “reign” all that much anymore. There are still Persians but not really much of an empire left. Still, these world powers had great influence on world history.", 
        "5_Daf, 3_Comment": "According to this counter tradition, when things are going well for the Jews, either because it is the end of days and God has made it clear that He desires the Jews, or when Jewish kings ruled, converts are not accepted. The underlying idea is that non-Jews should convert purely out of love, without any ulterior motive such as justification in the eyes of God or power/money. To be sure that this is so, non-Jews are not accepted as converts during times when it seems that they may have ulterior motives While the Jewish community will not accept these converts, they will simply begin to act as Jews, in an attempt to save themselves at the time of the Messiah. However, when they see the destruction of Gog and Magog they will take flight in fear. It is at this point that God will laugh at the non-Jews who do not trust in God’s protection. This is the only day on which God will laugh.", 
        "4_Daf, 17_Comment": "Sukkah is an easy commandment because it does not cause any financial loss. This is different from something like peah (leaving the corners of your field for the poor) which obviously does cause a financial loss.", 
        "4_Daf, 7_Comment": "The nations now plead before God, asking God for in essence a second chance. God responds with a famous statement, that even has echoes in the Gospels. However, God does offer them an easy mitzvah to keep. Stay tuned for tomorrow where we see if the nations can keep the mitzvah of sukkah! ", 
        "6_Daf, 0_Comment": "Introduction<br>The sugya begins with another comparison between fish and human beings.", 
        "3_Daf, 0_Comment": "The Talmud corrects a small misunderstanding in the previous text. God could not have been confused as to which nation is which. God is, after all, all-knowing. Rather, God separated them out for their own good. This would make it easier for them to understand God’s words, which as we shall see, were directed at individual nations.", 
        "6_Daf, 16_Comment": "Only Bilaam could determine precisely that one infinitesimally small moment when God’s anger is unleashed every day. Interestingly, while Bilaam is vilified, the rabbis do acknowledge him as a prophet.", 
        "2_Daf, 4_Comment": "To support both readings in the Mishnah, the Talmud quotes verses that use both words. We should note that the words have different meanings and neither means “festivals.” Most scholars do not think that the rabbinic word is actually related to the biblical Hebrew. Rather, it comes from a different origin altogether (and is related to the word Ides, as in “the Ides of March.) The sugya presents midrash on the biblical word—it connects two words that sound the same but originally had different meanings.", 
        "5_Daf, 8_Comment": "Aha says that once the Temple was destroyed there was no more laughter, i.e. joy, for God. The Talmud will now search for a proof text for this. A verse in Isaiah in which God calls Israel to weep and wail may refer only to the day on which the Temple was destroyed. It does not mean that the weeping and wailing must continue forever.", 
        "3_Daf, 8_Comment": "Like the Romans, the Persians also claim that they have been busy building the world so that Israel can be free to occupy themselves with Torah.", 
        "7_Daf, 2_Comment": "This is the conclusion of the passage. Bilaam did not really know God—he only knew when exactly during the day God would get angry. This would assumedly help him in his attempt to curse Israel.", 
        "3_Daf, 9_Comment": "The Persians claims are rejected in the same manner in which the claims of the Romans were.", 
        "5_Daf, 11_Comment": "Now that laughter has been removed from the world, what does God do during the fourth quarter of each day? He teaches children.", 
        "5_Daf, 20_Comment": "In this second possibility, the sun is reserved for the world to come where it will consume the wicked and bring healing to the righteous. This is the nature of the sun—it can cause both great harm and great good.", 
        "6_Daf, 2_Comment": "In judgment God is merciful. He does not exert his full power. But in a time of war, His full might is made known. ", 
        "4_Daf, 19_Comment": "If God wanted to give the non-Jews a chance to keep the mitzvot, why did he make it so hot for them in the sukkah? The answer is that Jews also have end up sitting in the sukkah when it is quite hot. I can testify to this myself—it can get quite toasty in the sukkah when Sukkot falls early in the season.<br>The next problem is that Jews do not have to sit in the sukkah if its boiling hot and makes them uncomfortable. So why blame the non-Jews for leaving the sukkah in the same situation?<br>The answer is that while Jews need not sit in the sukkah when it’s hot, they should not kick it when they go out.", 
        "5_Daf, 13_Comment": "God seems to have fun by night. Either he rides around on his chariot, visiting his 18,000 worlds. Or he listens to his singing angels.", 
        "2_Daf, 3_Comment": "Rav and Shmuel disagree as to the exact word that appears in the Mishnah which I have rendered “festivals.”", 
        "5_Daf, 5_Comment": "The notion that God laughs only at the end of days is countered by a tradition in which God laughs, playing with the leviathan, every day. ", 
        "4_Daf, 11_Comment": "Sukkah is an easy commandment because it does not cause any financial loss. This is different from something like peah (leaving the corners of your field for the poor) which obviously does cause a financial loss.", 
        "4_Daf, 16_Comment": "God wanted to give the nations a second chance. This is God after all—He makes up the rules!", 
        "5_Daf, 2_Comment": "According to this passage, at the end of days the non-Jews will come and convert. ", 
        "2_Daf, 5_Comment": "The one who related the word to Deuteronomy, where it is found with an aleph, chose that verse because there the word has the connotation of calamity. It is as if he says that the festivals of the idolaters are actually calamities.", 
        "5_Daf, 16_Comment": "Studying at night seems to be preferable to study during the day. Perhaps because there are less visual distractions at night. Or maybe people’s hearts are open at night.", 
        "7_Daf, 16_Comment": "Joshua b. Levi defends the Israelites who worshipped the golden calf. The verse proves the faith of the Israelites that stood at Sinai.", 
        "6_Daf, 12_Comment": "Abahu explains the meaning of the verse through a parable. God does exact payment from Israel for its sins, but he does so in a kind way. In contrast, when exacting payment from the non-Jews, the entire payment may come at once.<br>It should be noted that these traditions may, at least in part, be an attempt to explain the poor political state in which the Jews were in during this period (and throughout most of political history). If God loves the Jews so much, then why are the non-Jews ruling the world? The answer, at least one answer, is that God is holding back His revenge on the nations of the world. This is a common notion in both Judaism and early Christianity.", 
        "7_Daf, 4_Comment": "God’s wrath is brief, as we have seen before.", 
        "7_Daf, 6_Comment": "Abaye provides a natural phenomenon by which to determine when God’s wrath occurs.", 
        "8_Daf, 0_Comment": "The Talmud now explains why we needed to learn the examples of both the sinning individual and the sinning community to teach that both individuals and communities can do teshuvah.", 
        "6_Daf, 4_Comment": "R. Hinena b. Papa explains the first half of the verse and how it fits with the second half of the verse. Both halves refer to Israel. God says that had He not taken a vow, He would have been full of fury at Israel.", 
        "7_Daf, 12_Comment": "Earlier we said that God sits in judgment during the second three hours of the day, not the first. So why not pray during the first three hours, when we could assume that God’s mercy would be greater?<br>There are two ways of solving the problem. The first is to switch the order of what God does at what time during the day.<br>The second is to note that it would be better to pray when God is not studying Torah. Torah is “truth”—there is no hiding what one has done. It is absolute, without any mercy. But “judgment” can involve a measure of mercy. Thus it would be better to pray when God is acting as a judge, one involved in the lives of humans, then as something akin to a philosopher, who only cares about absolute truth and justice.", 
        "3_Daf, 15_Comment": "The Talmud adjusts their claim against God. God forced the Israelites to accept the Torah. But he did not force the nations. Had he forced them, they would have accepted it. So how can he judge them?", 
        "6_Daf, 13_Comment": "This section interprets Abraham’s claim against God before God destroys Sodom. It opens a discussion of God’s justice, and an attempt to resolve contradictory verses.", 
        "2_Daf, 8_Comment": "Huna son of R. Joshua finds another verse that uses the word “edehem” with an aleph and clearly refers to idolaters.", 
        "3_Daf, 16_Comment": "The Talmud now continues interpreting the next part of the verse from Isaiah, “Let us continue the happenings of old.” God responds to the nations that they did not keep even the commandments that they did receive, the seven Noahide laws. Having seen that collectively they did not keep them, God says that henceforth even if they do observe these commandments, they will not receive their reward for them. This is a very interesting claim. I think the idea is that if one does not regularly observe certain moral precepts, one does not receive reward for happenstance observance of them. Reward entails a commitment to a particular act, to make a habit out of it. Now I know that there are contradictory texts out there. But to me, this is what this text is hinting at. ", 
        "6_Daf, 1_Comment": "Like fish, human beings are inclined to violence. ", 
        "7_Daf, 15_Comment": "This is another statement by R. Joshua b. Levi about Jews and non-Jews in the world to come.", 
        "7_Daf, 8_Comment": "God’s moment of wrath occurs at the hour of the morning when kings put on their crowns and bow down to the sun.", 
        "6_Daf, 8_Comment": "God thought that he would redeem the non-Jews by simply punishing them through monetary possessions. But this didn’t work and the non-Jews plotted against God anyways.", 
        "6_Daf, 14_Comment": "Those who are righteous but do not stand up against the wicked are punished as if they were themselves wicked. This is a message that still rings true through the generations.", 
        "7_Daf, 14_Comment": "This midrash on Isaiah was the basis of the long eschatological drama with which the tractate opened. It is brought here again because it is another related statement by R. Joshua b. Levi.", 
        "7_Daf, 5_Comment": "Two verses are brought to show that God’s wrath lasts only a moment.", 
        "3_Daf, 4_Comment": "The Kingdom of Rome was certainly known for being great and wealthy builders in the ancient world. They come in front of God and claim to have done so all for the sake of Israel. They worked so that Israel could study Torah.", 
        "4_Daf, 6_Comment": "God responds that non-Jews themselves can testify that Israelites did not sin. The aggadah now lists some well-known non-Jews throughout history who interacted with various Israelites who did not sin. Most of these are probably familiar episodes. Bildad, Zophar and Eliphaz are the friends of Job who urge him to curse God. Job does not. (Elihu son of Barachel is also a friend of Job, but according to another section of the Talmud, he was Jewish). This brings us back to the verse from Isaiah 43:9 which is the backbone of the entire derashah.", 
        "3_Daf, 11_Comment": "The aggadah assumes that at this point every nation comes forth before God, and each nation’s claim fails. The other nations thought they had a chance because at least they did not impress Israel.", 
        "2_Daf, 11_Comment": "At first all of the nations come in front of God all mixed in together. But then they separate such that each comes one at a time. As we shall see, each kingdom will come in front of God, one at a time.", 
        "3_Daf, 7_Comment": "The Persians come in next. This is based on the verse from Daniel that says that the second nation is similar to a bear and R. Joseph identifies the verse as referring to the Persians. As an aside, after reading this, I feel that I may have a bit of bear in me.", 
        "4_Daf, 2_Comment": "The resolution is that non-Jews who perform commandments do receive a reward, albeit not one as great as Israel who is commanded to perform the mitzvot.", 
        "2_Daf, 2_Comment": "Introduction<br>The tractate opens with a lexigraphical discussion of the word I have translated “festival”—איד, whether it is spelled with an aleph or an ayin. While today Ashkenazim and Sephardim do not distinguish in pronouncing these letters, originally they were pronounced differently. Jews of Yemenite descent still pronounce the ayin as a guttural letter, closer to the Arabic sound of “gh.” This is why Aza in Hebrew became Gaza or Amora (and in Sodom and Amora) became Gemorra.", 
        "3_Daf, 2_Comment": "The first kingdom to enter is Rome, for they were the most powerful nation in the world, certainly at the time of the rabbis.", 
        "5_Daf, 1_Comment": "Introduction<br>This section relates loosely to yesterday’s section in that it too quotes the statement of R. Yitzchak.", 
        "4_Daf, 15_Comment": "How can God offer a mitzvah to the nations to perform in the world to come? According to a very common Jewish idea, the mitzvoth are to be performed in the here and now, today. The end of days is when people will be rewarded for their performance, but by that point it is too late to actually perform them.", 
        "5_Daf, 12_Comment": "Since God started teaching children only after the destruction of the Temple, who taught them before. There are two answers. The first is Metatron, one of God’s archangels. The other answer is that God educated the children, while he was doing other things. God should be able to multitask, I would think.", 
        "7_Daf, 9_Comment": "Judgement is dished out during the first three hours of the day, when kings wake up, put on their crowns and bow down to the sun. Since God tends to be angry at this time, an individual should not pray the Musaf prayer for Rosh Hashanah lest God examine his deeds too closely and judge him accordingly.", 
        "6_Daf, 10_Comment": "Abahu tells the “minim” that R. Safra is a great man. It is hard to identify who exactly the “minim” are here, but it seems to be simply non-Jews, those with the authority to impose or exempt others from taxes. There are many scholars who interpret these people to be some type of Jewish-Christians, those who would care about biblical interpretation. So they ask him to interpret a verse, but he does not know how to explain it to them. This disappoints them tremendously.", 
        "6_Daf, 9_Comment": "This is basically the same version as the previous statement.", 
        "6_Daf, 3_Comment": "God has no fury for Jews, but does have fury on non-Jews. Of course, I realize that this is a type of statement that will make people feel uncomfortable. It is something we will see quite a bit of throughout the tractate. ", 
        "7_Daf, 17_Comment": "Here R. Yohanan offers the same explanation as above, but this time including a reference to David’s sin with Bathsheva. While we might find it difficult to accept justification for sinning, this is an excellent justification for why we remember our sinning ancestors. The stories we tell are not of perfect individuals or communities. They are of deeply flawed and human characters, struggling to do the right thing, but often succumbing to temptations.", 
        "6_Daf, 6_Comment": "Again, God does not treat Jews as he does non-Jews. With Jews, He exacts vengeance just a little bit at a time. But when it comes to non-Jews, when exacting vengeance, he exacts it all at once, making a ruinous heap.", 
        "7_Daf, 1_Comment": "This is probably something you did not know from the Bible. Not usually taught in Hebrew school.", 
        "8_Daf, 1_Comment": "A difficult verse in II Samuel is interpreted as alluding to David’s role as teaching of the possibility of repentance.", 
        "5_Daf, 10_Comment": "The Talmud finally settles on a verse which can be used to prove that from the time the Temple was destroyed there is no more laughter before God.", 
        "5_Daf, 17_Comment": "This is another version of Resh Lakish’s midrash on the verse. Studying in this world will lead to grace in the world to come.", 
        "8_Daf, 2_Comment": "Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins with another statement by R. Shmuel b. Nahmani.", 
        "3_Daf, 6_Comment": "Introduction<br>Persia enters next.", 
        "4_Daf, 12_Comment": "The non-Jews go out and make sukkot, but God causes it to be so hot that they tear them down immediately. There is a pun being made on this verse—the last word is “עבות “which is also used in Psalms 118:27, which is connected in rabbinic thought with Sukkot.", 
        "5_Daf, 6_Comment": "There is a difference, as we know, between laughing with someone, and laughing at someone. God laughs at his creatures in mockery only at the end of days. Until then, his laughter is not of scorn but of joy. ", 
        "2_Daf, 1_Comment": "Exodus 23:13 states, “Make no mention of the names of other gods; they shall not be heard on your lips.”  From the last part of this verse, “they shall not be heard on your lips” the Rabbis created a midrash that a Jew should avoid giving a non-Jew a reason to bring a sacrifice or libation to his foreign god.  Therefore, during the three days preceding pagan holidays, Jews should avoid any business transactions with non-Jews, lest the non-Jew thank his god for this transaction.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, this prohibition works in both directions.  It is forbidden for Jews to sell, lend or repay non-Jews and likewise it is forbidden to buy, borrow or receive repayment from them.  According to this opinion, all of these transactions may potentially cause the non-Jew to celebrate and therefore should be avoided.  Rabbi Judah dissents with regards to receiving repayment from non-Jews.  Since repaying a debt causes sorrow to a person, it is permitted to receive repayment during this time, since the non-Jew will not thank his god after having done so.  The Rabbis respond to Rabbi Judah that repaying a debt can indeed be a cause of celebration, even if the immediate parting with the money is depressing.  Therefore it too is prohibited three days preceding a holiday.<br>We should note that although this mishnah seems to be of a restrictive nature, it does indeed allow business transactions at any time that is not three days before their festivals.  In other words, by forbidding the conduct of business on certain days the mishnah tacitly permits conducting business with non-Jews on other days.  This was of course an economic necessity; even before the modern “global economy” no people could survive without conducting business with other peoples.", 
        "4_Daf, 14_Comment": "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, God offers the nations the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah of the sukkah, even though the end of days is already here. Today’s section asks whether mitzvoth can be fulfilled at the end of days. Or is it too late then.", 
        "5_Daf, 0_Comment": "On that day, when the nations finally fail in their claims before God, God will laugh (the word can also be translated as delight).", 
        "5_Daf, 7_Comment": "Introduction<br>This sugya continues the discussion of laughter.", 
        "4_Daf, 13_Comment": "If God wanted to give the non-Jews a chance to keep the mitzvot, why did he make it so hot for them in the sukkah? The answer is that Jews also have end up sitting in the sukkah when it is quite hot. I can testify to this myself—it can get quite toasty in the sukkah when Sukkot falls early in the season. The next problem is that Jews do not have to sit in the sukkah if its boiling hot and makes them uncomfortable. So why blame the non-Jews for leaving the sukkah in the same situation? The answer is that while Jews need not sit in the sukkah when it’s hot, they should not kick it when they go out.", 
        "3_Daf, 5_Comment": "The Holy Blessed One will say in reply: “You foolish ones in the world, all that which you have done, you have only done to satisfy your own desires. You have established marketplaces to place prostitutes in them; baths, to delight yourself in them; silver and gold, that is mine, as it is said: “Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold, says the Lord of Hosts” (Haggai 2:8).  Are there any among you who have been declaring this? As it is said, “Who among you declares this? (Isaiah 43:9). And “this” is nothing but Torah, as it is said: “And this is the Torah which Moses set before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44).  They will then depart crushed in spirit.<br>God denies all of their claims as to having done anything for Israel. All they did, they did for themselves. The verses in Isaiah 43:9 which began the derashah continues with the phrase, “Who among you declares this?” and “this” is interpreted as referring to Torah. Thus only a nation that actually occupies itself with Torah will be justified.", 
        "4_Daf, 5_Comment": "All of these sources and derashot prove that the existence of heaven and earth depend on Israel performing the commandments. This makes them partial witnesses, who are not likely to testify that Israel did not perform the commandments. The notion that the world depends on the performance of the commandments is one found throughout rabbinic literature. The mitzvoth have cosmic importance. ", 
        "2_Daf, 10_Comment": "At the end of days God will invite all of the nations to come forward and justify themselves in front of Him for having observed the Torah.", 
        "3_Daf, 3_Comment": "This section answers why the most important party comes in for judgement first. It follows the pattern of the king standing trial before the community does. This is either due to the respect owed to the king or to allow the king to stand trial before God’s full anger is aroused.", 
        "7_Daf, 7_Comment": "Again we hear of a “min” perhaps a Jewish-Christian, who is troubling a rabbi with verses. R. Joshua b. Levi thinks he can curse the min at the exact moment when God’s wrath is let loose. But it does not work—he can’t get the exact time write. So don’t try this at home. Furthermore, a righteous person should not be asking for others to be punished.", 
        "4_Daf, 3_Comment": "We now return to the main thread of the aggadah—the dialogue between God and the nations of the world. I think we can see this claim coming a mile away. Why are the non-Jews punished for not observing the Torah? Do they Jews do such a good job? One need not read far into the Bible to find Jews committing sins rampantly. God attempts to find witnesses to testify that Israel does observe the Torah. Stay tuned—the drama continues tomorrow!", 
        "7_Daf, 10_Comment": "The congregation (minyan) can pray at that time because the collective merits of the community are sufficient.", 
        "8_Daf, 3_Comment": "Mitzvot and sins are personified here, leading the person towards justification in the world to come or condemnation at the Day of Judgment.", 
        "7_Daf, 13_Comment": "This statement appeared earlier in the context of God asking the non-Jews to perform the mitzvot at the end of days.", 
        "3_Daf, 10_Comment": "The Persians thought they stood a better chance than the Romans because they built the Temple (under the direction of Cyrus and Darius, who let the Israelites return to Israel) whereas the Romans destroyed it.", 
        "4_Daf, 20_Comment": "On that day, when the nations finally fail in their claims before God, God will laugh (the word can also be translated as delight).", 
        "7_Daf, 11_Comment": "One can pray shacharit, the morning prayer, as an individual knowing that some congregation somewhere will be praying at that time.", 
        "4_Daf, 10_Comment": "God wanted to give the nations a second chance. This is God after all—He makes up the rules!", 
        "5_Daf, 4_Comment": "While the Jewish community will not accept these converts, they will simply begin to act as Jews, in an attempt to save themselves at the time of the Messiah. However, when they see the destruction of Gog and Magog they will take flight in fear. It is at this point that God will laugh at the non-Jews who do not trust in God’s protection. This is the only day on which God will laugh.", 
        "2_Daf, 6_Comment": "The reading of the word with an ayin connects it to the verse in Isaiah. There it means testimony brought before God. This reading is preferable because the testimony brought before God is what will bring about their calamity.", 
        "3_Daf, 13_Comment": "Introduction<br>The aggadah about all of the nations coming in front of God on judgment day continues. ", 
        "2_Daf, 0_Comment": "Introduction to Avodah Zarah<br>“Avodah Zarah” is the Hebrew word for idolatry.  It literally means “foreign worship”.  Tractate Avodah Zarah discusses the prohibition of Jews using objects that non-Jews may have used while worshipping idols.  The central idea is that once an object has been used in idol worship the object is forbidden to be used by Jews.  There are many passages in the Torah which strictly forbid Jews from worshipping idols and enjoin them to destroy any of the objects used in idol worship (see for instance Exodus 23:24, 32-33; 34:12-16; Deuteronomy 7:1-5, 25-26; 12:1-3).  The Rabbis went further in these prohibitions and created an entire system of law meant to keep Jews away from non-Jews and their idolatrous practices. Throughout Jewish history these laws aided in preserving the distinct identity of the Jewish people.  However, they also were a primary cause in anti-Semitism, with non-Jews frequently scorning Jews for their separatist practices.<br>Rabbi Menahem Meiri, a Talmudic commentator who lived in Provence in the 14th century recognized that Christianity and Islam were not the same as the pagan religions that existed in the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Christianity and Islam are both monotheistic religions with systems of law and many shared values with Judaism.  He therefore stated that most of the laws regarding non-Jews do not apply to the members of these religions. Other Rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Menahem Meiri. Even the Meiri often insisted that the Jews had to continue to distance themselves from non-Jews, based on Talmudic law.<br>Whether or not we agree with Rabbi Menahem Meiri or with his detractors, while learning this tractate I think we should keep in mind the vast differences between the circumstances in which we live and in which the rabbis lived.  The Rabbis were surrounded by a hostile culture from which they wanted to keep as great of a distance as possible.  Oftehn times they were creating a “straw” non-Jew, one whose behavior does not reflect how non-Jews actually acted. This is often a strategy adopted by a group that wishes to differentiate itself from other groups.<br>In today’s world our surrounding culture is thankfully much more respectful of Jewish differences. We do, and should, celebrate and learn from our contacts with people from all cultures, and certainly, I believe we should be respectful of the customs, practices and beliefs that differentiate Jews from non-Jews. However, we should also keep in mind that the ultimate goal of the Rabbis was to preserve Jewish identity and religion. The problem of how we accomplish this today when most of these laws are no longer observed and contact between Jews and non-Jews is great, is probably the greatest problem that modern Jews face.", 
        "4_Daf, 0_Comment": "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section concluded with the statement that even if the nations of the world observe the Noahide commandments, they still do not receive a reward for doing so. Today’s section begins with a critique of that view. ", 
        "6_Daf, 15_Comment": "If God is angry every day, and no one can stand before his anger, then how can people exist? The answer is that individuals suffer the wrath of God and as such, fail to stand. But the community continues to exist.", 
        "3_Daf, 1_Comment": "Introduction<br>Rome is the first to enter in front of God.", 
        "6_Daf, 11_Comment": "Many historians have taken this exchange as evidence of the difference between rabbis living in Palestine, where Christianity was strong and those from Babylonia, where Christianity was weaker. Those rabbis living among early Jewish-Christians, like R. Abahu, had to study verses so that they would know how to respond to Christological interpretations of Bible. But R. Safra, who was from Babylonia, knew tannaitic traditions, but did not know Bible nearly as well. Thus, he could not respond.", 
        "5_Daf, 19_Comment": "Just as fish are scorched by the sun, so too are humans. This statement is then applied to either this world or to the world to come. If it applies to this world, it is understood as something out of God’s control. God does not control the heat or cold. This is an interesting acknowledgment that not all natural phenomena are in the power of God.", 
        "6_Daf, 5_Comment": "This statement refers to something taught much earlier—God does not deal capriciously with His creatures. Before God goes to destroy the nations, he first examines their records."
