Do not be like a slave who was assigned an honorable task, one beneficial for him, and yet he spoils it. How dare he stand before the king! What, then, would be better than to ask for forgiveness when we say, “<i>Selach lonu</i>” (forgive us) in the Shemoneh Esrei, but worse than to recite it without conviction? If it is impossible to maintain concentration and devotion during the entire Prayer, say at least the first Blessing of the Shemoneh Esrei with sincerity, as well as the first verse of Krias Shema.

From the time of the Exodus from Egypt until the destruction of the Temple, God dwelt amongst us in the Tabernacle and Temple, and was close to us. This is what is called the Shechina (God’s neighboring Presence). Now, when we sanctify the New Moon, God again draws His Shechina near to us. How can we not be diligent and careful that we do not omit this blessing? For if Israel did not merit anything other than receiving the Shechina but once a month with this prayer, this would be enough!"
