        "3_ii; On Prayer, 23_Pesach, 1_ii, 6_Paragraph": "The one checking should take a candle in his hand; and it should be from wax, as I said. Then he recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has commanded us about the destruction of chametz.\" And he searches afterwards, since the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, \"One must recite the blessing over all commandments, passing upon them\" - meaning before [them]. And after checking, he takes the chametz in his hands and places it in a closet or in [another] place that a mouse cannot reach. It is like [the textual version] we teach in the Yerushalmi, \"How do we do it? We cover it with a vessel. If he covered it and did not find it, I say that a [human] hand took it. If he did not cover [it] and he did not find it, he needs to check the house another time.\" And afterwards, he nullifies all of the chametz that is in his possession that he does not know about. And he needs to express the nullification with his mouth, with words that nullify it in any language that he wants. However, it has become customary to nullify [it] with the wording of the Gemara. And that is: All the chametz that I have in my possession that I have not seen and that I do not know about, let it be considered like the dust of the earth (<i>Kol Chamira...</i>).",
        "13_xi; On the Education of Children, 2_Chastisement of love, 0_Paragraph": "How pleasant is the Musar of Love.  Anyone whom Hashem loves, God brings down upon them suffering. You find three good gifts that God gave to Israel; and they were only given by way of suffering. These are them: Torah, the Land of Israel, and the World to Come.  "
