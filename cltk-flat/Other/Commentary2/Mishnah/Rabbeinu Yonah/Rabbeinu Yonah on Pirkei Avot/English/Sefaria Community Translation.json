And even when a man toils greatly to do what is straight in the eyes of God, a man only accomplishes a small part of what he is obligated to do.\" And this is what is stated (Psalms 103:14), \"For He knows our impulse; He is mindful that we are dust.\" Since were it not that He made the evil impulse [powerful] in man - even without his working hard and pursuing the commandments - he would do many of them. [It would be] like in a high quality field - even if they did not toil in the work of his land - something would come out of it.

And it is like Yirmiyahu, peace be upon him, stated (Jeremiah 18:23), \"let them be made to stumble before You; act against them in Your hour of wrath!\" - even in the time that they do charity, make them stumble that they should give it in the incorrect place.

And it is like they said (Kiddushin 63b), \"And a man will not sin if it is not for himself.\" It comes out that both of them will repent, each one according to the word of his friend.

Since he is his ally, he will not reveal [his secrets] to others so as not to confound his plan - and not even to those that appear to him to be friends; for is the appearance of love evident on their faces?

As it establishes 'a pure heart' in a person and 'renews a proper spirit in his soul.' And \"it is praiseworthy to him from [other] people,\" in that the creations learn to act well and properly from him. [For example] with the trait of generosity, 'A miser will not be called noble,' and also a spendthrift will see evil. And [so] who is the generous one? One who - even though he loves money and saves it very well - consults generously and orders his spending so that he will have enough to do the good and the right in the place that is fitting to give to. So [too] there is no trait under the [sun] that [is proper] except (for) the middle path. And [these traits] are praiseworthy for the person adopting it, and praiseworthy to him from [other] people (but [not] if he does [too] little or [too] much).",

As with the righteous person, even with an action that is completely evil and leans toward guilt in every aspect, we should judge him favorably and say, \"'It was a mistake that came out from the hand of the ruler,' and behold he regretted and observed [it] and [already] requested forgiveness.\" And it is like the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 19a), \"If you see a Torah scholar who sinned at night, do not ruminate about him during the day, lest he has repented.

And such is the simple understanding of this mishnah. But if the matter is so, it speaks about the defect of kings. But forbid it, forbid it - that such should be the matter and that it should arise. As through them the whole world is sustained and they create law and justice in the world. And there is no man that can be as truthful as they, as they do not need to flatter creatures since they do are not afraid, and [so] there is nothing that prevents them from walking the straight path. And hence it appears [that it can] be said that the kings - be it their friendship or be it their enmity - are not in their [own] hands. And [so] when the king needs a person and brings him close and shows him friendship at the time that he benefits from him, it is from God that the matter went out, and not form the king. And God arranged that this person be of benefit to the king. And when a man sins to God and he is guilty and He wants to press him, who can stand for him? And even if the king  wants to do him honor, it is only in his hand to surely take the vengeance of God and to 'afflict the one that the Lord would love to chastise.' And this is what it states (Proverbs 21:1), \"Like channeled water is the heart of the king in the Lord’s hand.\" He wants to say, just like a person can direct a channel to any side that he wants, so [too] is the heart of the king in the hand of the Lord to direct it to do good 'to the person whose honor He desires' and 'to pay back His enemies in his face to destroy him.' And he stated, \"the heart of the king\" and he was not speaking about other people, but so is it that all hearts are 'in the hand of the Lord.' As even though, [a person] thinks thoughts and it appears to the eyes that he has the ability in his hand to act, in truth he does not have the power in his hand to do bad or to do good, but rather [to do] the word of the living God.",

Behold that one should not push off the small ones for the bigger ones, since the kids will become goats.\" And about this matter the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Yevamot 62b), \"'Sow your seed in the morning, and don’t hold back your hand in the evening' (Ecclesiastes 11:6), - if you have raised disciples in your youth, raise disciples in your old age.\" Behold that the multiplication of disciples is a very good thing and a merit to the teacher.", 
        "1_Perek, 4_Mishna, 0_Comment": "<b>He was accustomed to say: A boor <i>bur</i> cannot fear sin. An ignorant person (literally, a man of the land - <i>am haarets</i>) cannot be pious:</b> The boor is empty - he does not have in him Torah or commandments or the way of the world in terms of good traits. And in the Targum (Onkelos on Genesis 47:19), \"do not place,\" is \"do not <i>tabur</i>. And he was not required [to say], a boor cannot be pious, since he cannot even fear of sin - as from his emptiness, he does not [even] know to guard himself from sins. But an ignoramus is involved with the creatures through important traits and has a few strait character traits: He knows how to protect himself and [so] he guards himself from transgressions. And he is [even] able to be righteous and to do and to fulfill what he is [told] that he is commanded. But only one who is great in Torah [knowledge] can reach the level of piety, since it is a trait that requires purity of heart and cleanness of soul. And [the ignoramus] does not have in his hand the wisdom to veer from the middle marker to the far end to fulfill [going] beyond the [letter] of the law. And because of this he is called an <i>am haarets</i>, since he is with them in <i>derekh haarets</i> (good manners), and because most of the world (land - <i>haarets</i>) is like him.",

Then, due to our sins, the Temple was destroyed and the service was annulled. And prayer is now for us in its place, as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Taanit 2a), \"'And to serve him with all your hearts' (Deuteronomy 11:13) - what service is there in the heart, one should say this is prayer.\" And this is what it states (Psalms 51:17), \"Lord, open my lips,\" as King David said this verse about the sin of Batsheva which was volitional, and one cannot bring a sacrifice for volitional sins. And about this he stated (Psalms 51:18), \"Since You do not want me to bring sacrifices; You do not desire burnt offerings.\" Had I been able to bring a sacrifice to atone for myself, I would have brought [it]. Now that I cannot, 'Lord, open my lips and let my mouth say your praise,' and accept my prayer in place of a sacrifice and let it atone me for my sin. Also for us that do not have a sacrifice to atone for us - not accidental sins and not volitional sins - 'Lord, open my lips' and accept our prayers in place of the sacrifices.  ", 
        "1_Perek, 3_Mishna, 1_Comment": "<b>so that He will make your will like His will:</b> God, may He blessed, 'satiates the will of every living thing,' and 'gives bread to all flesh' and to every creature according to its lack - and this is His want and His will. And if you merit to [find favor] in front of Him, He will do your will also with the needs of your small world, and give you your sustenance - which is [actually] His will for all that come to the world.", 
        "1_Perek, 1_Mishna, 4_Comment": "<b>for the merit of their ancestors sustains them, And their righteousness (tsidkatam) will endure forever:</b> As even though you are involved with them, their needs are accomplished by them; it is not you that caused them, but rather the merit of the ancestors of the community that \"sustains them, And their righteousness will endure forever\" - for a thousand generations.", 
        "1_Perek, 0_Mishna, 2_Comment": "<b>And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one, for you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments:</b> Even though the punishments for sins are explained to us - as some of them  are with excision (<i> karet</i>) and some with death at the hands of Heaven, excision being that he and his seed are cut off whereas death at the hands of Heaven is only that he is cut off, and there are some sins that get the four death penalties meted out by the court, and there are negative commandments that bring forty lashes, and the one who transgresses the rabbinic laws gets rabbinic lashes for rebellion - but the reward of the [positive] commandments is not explained to us, not for the light ones and not for the weighty ones. And the sages, may their memory be blessed, demonstrated [this with] a metaphor (Pesikta Rabbati 23), \"To what is this similar? To a king who gave an orchard for his servants in which to plant tree. And if he made known to them the giving of reward [of the different trees], they would have all toiled on those trees that have a large reward, and it would come out that the orchard would be missing the other [trees]. So [too], were the Holy One, blessed be He, to make known the giving of reward for the [different] commandments, [people] would do the weighty ones that have a large reward and leave over the light ones that have a smaller reward, and a person would be incomplete in the commandments.\" And for this reason, one should not be lenient about the commandments, and his soul should hold them [all] dear to do, since he does not know which are the light ones and which are the weighty ones. But our rabbi (R. Yehuda HaNassi, the author of this mishnah) excelled in his words and gave a stronger reason than this and said that \"you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments\" [as to] how much it is - as even the reward of a light commandment is highly elevated. And you should be careful not to lose such a great gain, like the matter that they said (Chullin 142a), \"'If you chance upon the nest of a bird in front of you, etc.' (Deuteronomy 22:6) - and if for a commandment as light as a small coin the Torah says, 'in order that it will be good for you' in the world that is completely good 'and that you will have length of days' in the world that is completely long, all the more is it so for the weighty commandments of the Torah.\"",
