And the reason for the word \"yourself\" was to warn Moses that he himself, and no other, should carve the tablets.  For the word \"yourself\" connotes isolation, as it was written [with respect to Abraham], \"Go yourself from your land ...\" that Abraham should go without his father or relatives (as explained there).  Similarly [with respect to the spies sent to Canaan], \"Send for yourself men ...\" that Moses should send them alone, apart from the rest of the nation.  And here, God saw that the tablets encompassed two miraculous qualities.  The first was that the workmanship was divine work, done in a miraculous fashion, and the second was the inscription, which was divinely written.  When Moses shattered the tablets, the workmanship and form was lost, but the words inscribed were not destroyed or lost. Therefore, God commanded Moses to carve the stone to make new tablets, ready to be inscribed, for it was Moses' obligation since he destroyed the first set of tablets.  However, He said the inscription would not be written by Moses, because he did not destroy ",

        "4_Deuteronomy, 16_Chapter, 13_Verse, 5_Paragraph": "First Introduction: Behold, it is fitting that we know if a king is a necessary and intrinsically obligatory thing for a nation or whether it is possible without him. And the philosophers already thought that it was [necessary] and that the dominion of a king to a politically organized nation is like the relationship of the heart to the body of a living being that has a heart, and like the relationship of the First Cause to the world more generally. And even though these analysts reason that monarchy insures three things – the first being unity and the absence of [division], the second being continuity and the lack of [instability], and the third being absolute power – [in fact], their thinking about the obligation and necessity of a king is actually false. [This] since it is not to be denied that there can be many leaders of the people that gather and unite and agree upon one policy and that the leadership and law be according to them – and this goes against the first [claim]. And why should their leadership not be [for] one year or three years like the years of an employee or less? And when the turn of other 'judges and officers' arrives, they will rise instead of them and faithfully investigate the sin of the first ones, and that which they condemn must pay all that they have done badly – and this goes against the second [claim]. And why should their power also not be limited, as with religions and mores [– and this goes against the third claim]. And logic dictates that when an individual [disagrees] with a group, the law follows the group. And it is more likely that the lapse be with one man – as it stated (Proverbs 16:14), “The king’s wrath is a messenger of death” - than it be that the many would trespass when they take counsel together. As if one strays from the path, the others will protest against him. And since their leadership is temporary and they will have to be accountable after a 'few days,' that fear of flesh and blood is upon them. And why do we need to bring theoretical claims for this, as behold, experience trumps modeling: Look and see the lands the leadership of which is with kings, and [by contrast,] today we have seen many lands the leadership of which is is with temporary judges and leaders that are chosen among them and the King God is with them. Their law is refined by ordered limits, and [their leaders] are the ones that control the people that make the matters of war; none can stand in front of them – not from a tribe, and not from his land. Did you not know, did you not hear that a great land governed over the whole world, consumed the whole earth – search it and note it – while its leadership was through the Councils, that were wholesome and many and their leadership was temporary. However, afterward they were made a tributary. And also today, the Commonwealth of Venice, that great mistress among the nations, the rulers over states; and the Country of Florence, the beauty of all the lands; and other countries small and large are run by the mouth of leaders elected for set periods of time. And behold, the elected governments have 'in them nothing perverse or crooked' – no one raises his hand or foot to [do] a wrongful thing – and they conquer lands that are not theirs with wisdom, understanding and knowledge. And all of this shows that the presence of a king is not necessary for a nation, and like the teacher of the Guide (Maimonides) mentioned. And it is a wonder about this supposed opinion, that compares the unity of a [human] king over the control and will of people to the unity of the ancient necessary First Cause, may He be blessed. However, [even] in an animal body, the sages have already written that there are three main organs in its governance. And even according to the opinion of the head of the philosophers that only the heart is the main [one], behold, this is concerning the generation of the spirit, but it does not contradict that the government of the living faculties is from the brain, and the natural ones is from the liver. In the final analysis, it is impossible for natural matters not to be like this; as from the act of [Divine] will, they are [only] from the substance of that [which] is possible - ‘how can straw be compared to grain?’ And one should not ask from the statement (Proverbs 28:2), “When there is rebellion in the land, its ministers are many,” as there it is speaking about ministers, not about leaders and judges. And how will we [miss] that which is well-known among all, that when the leaders are good, it is better that they be many; and if they are bad, it is more dangerous. And therefore, I think that the kings were not set up with the examination of the people at first, and as it is written (Isaiah 7:6), “We will march against Yehudah and invade it […], and we will set up a king in it.” And even if they were only appointed by way of trustees to serve the people, and they are made masters, as if God, may He be blessed, gave them the ‘land and its fullness’; and they bequeathed it to their sons after them forever, as if it was land that he bought with his money, this too is ‘not worthwhile (literally, the same)’ with all reigns, as there will be kings that do not have leadership abilities. And this is the First Introduction.  ",

        "4_Deuteronomy, 0_Chapter, 33_Verse, 5_Paragraph": "And since Israel sinned willingly, and he, peace be upon him, sinned by mistake and with a good intention, God, may he be blessed, wanted to to spare the honor of Moshe, [such that] his decree should not be amidst the decree of the people in <i>Parshat Shelach Lecha Anashim</i>. And [so] He delayed His anger upon him, as He delayed His anger upon Aharon for the story of the [golden] calf. And when in <i>Parshat Zot Chukat HaTorah</i> the people complained about the water, and in their complaint, they pointed out how Moshe and Aharon were the cause of the people's death and that they [would] not enter the land - as they said (Numbers 20:4), \"And why did you bring the congregation of the Lord to this wilderness to die there, us and our cattle\" - the verse mentioned that Moshe and Aharon went from in front of the congregation to the tent of meeting, mourning and with covered heads; and [they were] like embarrassed women at the mention of their sins. And thus did the word [of God] come to them that they should speak and do the act that He mentioned to extract the water. And when Moshe came to anger in his saying (Numbers 20:10), \"Listen now, you rebels,\" the Holy One, blessed be He, became full of anger with him; since Israel caught him fittingly and He did not admit in his heart that which he sinned, and [so] got angry with them. And therefore He saw at this time to give [Moshe and Aharon] their punishment for their earlier sins. And, if so, the Waters of Merivah were the means to the thing and not the actual cause for it.",

For God promised \"I will allow all of My goodness to pass before you ... and I will remove My hand and you will see Me from behind.\"  Yet we do not seen this enacted [in the verses]; neither God's passing His goodness before Moses, nor Moses seeing Him from behind. God also said, \"I will proclaim the Name of the Lord before you, and the grace that I grant and the compassion that I show,\" which are the three attributes (God, Compassion, Grace) and no others.  Yet, at the moment of action, He proclaimed thirteen attributes.  And so He added upon his promise.  And note that in His promise, Grace preceded Compassion, but in the recital of the thirteen attributes, Compassion came before Grace. ",

        "1_Exodus, 33_Chapter, 0_Verse, 16_Paragraph": "Response: \"And the Lord said to Moses, 'Carve for yourself' ... and Moses carved two tablets of stone.\"  The opinion of all authentic scholars is that Moses stood upon the mountain three times, forty days and forty night each time, for a total of four months and two days, with two additional days of descent in the interim.  For on the day that Moses initially descended, he destroyed the tablets, and the verse (Exodus 32) then states, \"On the following day, Moses said to the nation, 'You have sinned\" ... and now I will ascend to the Lord and will stand and pray there forty more days until your sins are forgiven.\"  On his second descent, the verse states, \"Moses awoke in the morning,\" it was four months and four days from the sixth day of Sivan (the date of Moses' first ascent) to Yom Kippur, which was on the tenth day of Tishrei.  And the order of the verses here supports this timeline.  Additionally, we have the verse from Deuteronomy (5:15) where Moses recounts three times that he stood upon Mt. Sinai, forty days each time, as it states, \"As I ascended to the mountain ... and I stayed upon the mountain forty days and forty nights.\"  And the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, and this is the first stay upon the mountain.  Afterwards, the verse states, \"I prostrated before the Lord as I did the first time, forty days and forty nights ... for all of your sins,\" and this is the second stay upon the mountain (and with respect to this, Moses also said, \"I prostrated myself before the Lord forty days and forty nights that I prostrated ...\" which are the days of the second ascent, which is recounted again so that Moses could share the prayer that he prayed at that time.  Afterwards he said, \"At that time, the Lord said to me, 'Carve for yourself two tablets of stone similar to the first ones' ... and I stood upon the mountain as I did the first time, for forty days and forty nights. And this was the third stay upon the mountain. \"And He answered,\" and with this answer the forgiveness was completed ",

Why were all of the attributes of mercy clustered together and all of the attributes of justice clustered together, instead of being mixed amongt each other?",

And also the scouts in their answers did not respond to this at all. But [rather], Moshe in his knowing the evil of the people, [understood] that there was to know whether the land was good and broad, plentiful of food and plentiful of settlement, in [such] a way that they would eat and be satiated and greatly delight upon it. And [so] he commanded them the two questions about the inhabited land and the two last questions about the land that is worked and sown. However, the other two questions Moshe invented himself, to ask about them. And this was in order that they know that the enemies were a large and strong nation and that the cities were fortified into the skies; and with this, they would recognize and know that their Savior is strong, and that it would not be with their [own] strength that they would inherit the land, and that their forearms would not deliver them. And hence they would increase their clinging to God, may He be blessed, and call to Him, 'since it is a time of trouble for Yaakov and from it he shall be delivered.' Behold, it has become clear from this that Moshe did not ask about the land, \"whether it is good or bad,\"  because of his being in doubt about the divine designs - God forbid - but rather to answer their questions, in his thinking that for this did they request to send scouts, as I elucidated; and that he only asked them, \"are they strong or weak, are they few or are they many,\" in order to sway their hearts to return to God and to supplicate in front of Him, 'since to God is deliverance,' and that they should say, \"Let us go and return to God,  so that He should do with us all of His wonders,\" and like he did at the [Reed] Sea. And it appears to me in truth that our master, Moshe, sinned in these first two questions that he asked about the people and the cities, as Israel did not ask them and also God, may He be blessed,  did not command about them, but [rather] he asked them on his own. And there is no doubt that his intention was good, but there came out from it what came out - 'like an error that goes out in front of the ruler.'

So why specify, \"the Lord passed before him,\" for after He proclaimed the name of the Lord there was no break in the attributes.  And there was no separation between them.  Note that in reference to the \"standing\" the verse did not say \"before him\", only that He stood there.  Indeed, in reference to His passing the verse says \"before him.\"  And pay no mind to the teaching that explains that the phrase \"the Lord passed before him\" means that, in response to Moses' desire to see the Lord's face, the Lord changed the subject by enumerating the attributes, for this is not supportable from the grammar or the context.

And the Psalmist said, \"the iniquities of my youth and my sins do not remember.\" And erase the crime.  Why did each one of these complete Sages independently invoke the erasure of crimes?

But calling out the Lord's honored name is not speaking down.
