        "18_Mishpatim, 2_Derech Chaim Tochachot Musar, 0_Paragraph": " “When you see the donkey of someone  you hate lying under its burden” (Shemos 23:5).   They explain that this  enmity refers to the person who sees his neighbor commit a sin but when there  is no other person present so that he cannot be testified against in a Court of  Law. In this case it is permitted to hate the sinner for the offence but,  nonetheless, the Torah says: “Azov ta’azov immo ('Thou shalt surely be of  help’),” explained by the Rabbis to mean: ‘You shall leave aside that [anger]  which is in your heart.' It is a religious duty to encourage lovingly, and,  perhaps, this way of dealing with the person will succeed. This is the very  quality of which God has spoken: “God retains not God’s anger forever.”"
