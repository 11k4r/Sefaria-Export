        "1_, 2_Chapter, 49_Paragraph": "<b>Anyone from whom the spirit of creations, etc.:</b> This statement is next to the two earlier statements - Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, etc. Anyone whose actions are more plentiful than his wisdom, etc., - as the teacher (tanna) comes to let us understand the connection of wisdom with fear of sin and the connection of  wisdom with actions, and that they have a indivisible connection to each other; and afterwards, he comes to let us understand that the spirit of the Omnipresent is also connected and joined with the spirit of the creations, and [so] that “anyone from whom the spirit of creations find pleasure, from him the spirit of God finds pleasure.” And this [teaching] is completely one with earlier ones, as if the spirit of the creations is substantial, then this matter in which the spirit of the Omnipresent finds pleasure has permanence; as things that are connected together do not have permanence one without the other, as it is in this matter. As the spirit of the Omnipresent and His will clings to the spirit of the creations, and that is because groups cling completely with Him, may He be blessed, to the point where the spirit of God clings to the spirit of the creations. And this is their statement, “anyone from whom the spirit of creations find pleasure, from him the spirit of God finds pleasure.” And these things are worthwhile to understand – how the spirit of the Omnipresent is connected to the spirit of the creations. And the witness to this is that which [the prophet] said, (Ezekiel 36:27), “And I will put My spirit into you.” And from this you see that the spirit of man was drawn from the spirit of the Omnipresent, like it is among the prophets, as it is written (Numbers 11:17), “and I will draw upon the spirit that is on you.” And so [too], the spirit of the Omnipresent is drawn into the spirit of the creations, as there is complete clinging and joining there. And therefore, [the teacher] said, “Anyone from whom the spirit of creations find pleasure, from him the spirit of God finds pleasure” – since the spirit of the creations is drawn from the spirit of the Omnipresent. And one should very much understand the words of wisdom - and that is that which was elucidated above regarding, “Make the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, like your will, etc.” - and there we elucidated that the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, is connected to the will of the creations. And this is what he said here as well, “Anyone from whom the spirit of creations find pleasure, from him the spirit of God finds pleasure, etc.”"
