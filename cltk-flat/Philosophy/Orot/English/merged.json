        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "The land of Israel is not an external thing, an external national acquisition, a means to the goal of general unity and strengthening of the physical or even spiritual. The land of Israel is an intrinsic section of the nation, attached to it with a living bond, entwined with its existence in internal uniqueness.", 
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Anticipating of redemption is the force which maintains Jewry in exile, and the Judaism of the Land ‎of Israel is the redemption itself…‎", 
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "It is therefore impossible to explain the uniqueness of the sanctity of the land of Israel, to actualize the depths of love for her, in any humanly rational way. It is only through the divine spirit which is on the nation as a whole, through the natural spiritual nature which exists in the soul of Israel, which spreads out through ", 
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 1_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "We do not reject any conception or understanding [of our relationship with the Land of Israel] which is founded upon righteousness and intellectual sensitivity and awe of heaven, in any form, but only that aspect which wishes to deny the secrets and their great influence upon the national spirit. This is a disaster against which we must battle, with counsel and understanding, with sanctity and with might.\n", 
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "Contemplating the Land of Israel as an external value which serves only the purpose of uniting the ‎nation, even for the sake of enabling the Jewish idea in exile, guarding its form, strengthening faith ‎and reverence and strengthening practical mitzvot in their proper form, does not produce durable ‎fruit. This foundation is rotten, compared to the sacred strength of the Land of Israel. True ‎strengthening of the Jewish idea in exile will only come via deep embedding in the Land of Israel; ‎via yearning for the Land of Israel, [the Jewish idea] will continually receive all of its independent ‎traits.‎"
