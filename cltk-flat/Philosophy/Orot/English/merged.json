        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "The Land of Israel is not an external thing, an external national property, a mere means toward the ‎end of national unification and reinforcement of the‏ ‏nation’s physical or even spiritual‏ ‏survival. The ‎Land of Israel is an independent entity, bound to the nation in the bond of life, embraced due to ‎internal inherent qualities.‎", 
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 3_Paragraph": "Anticipating of redemption is the force which maintains Jewry in exile, and the Judaism of the Land ‎of Israel is the redemption itself…‎", 
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "Therefore, it is not possible to identify the nature of the special holiness of the Land of Israel, and ‎to actualize this deep love for her, via any human, rational insight. [It is possible] only through the ‎Divine spirit which rests upon the nation as a whole, a natural spiritual imprint within the Israelite ‎soul, sending forth its radiance in natural colours through all of the paths of healthy sensation, and ‎shining its higher illumination according to that higher sacred spirit which fills with life and higher ‎beauty the hearts of those of holy conception and deep Israelite thought.‎", 
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 1_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "We do not reject any conception or understanding [of our relationship with the Land of Israel] which is founded upon righteousness and intellectual sensitivity and awe of heaven, in any form, but only that aspect which wishes to deny the secrets and their great influence upon the national spirit. This is a disaster against which we must battle, with counsel and understanding, with sanctity and with might.\n", 
        "0_Lights from Darkness, 0_Land of Israel, 0_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "Contemplating the Land of Israel as an external value which serves only the purpose of uniting the ‎nation, even for the sake of enabling the Jewish idea in exile, guarding its form, strengthening faith ‎and reverence and strengthening practical mitzvot in their proper form, does not produce durable ‎fruit. This foundation is rotten, compared to the sacred strength of the Land of Israel. True ‎strengthening of the Jewish idea in exile will only come via deep embedding in the Land of Israel; ‎via yearning for the Land of Israel, [the Jewish idea] will continually receive all of its independent ‎traits.‎"
