And this doubt that the questioner asked, behold one time with myself there was an event, that I measured in the middle of the Amida [of the afternoon prayer] that the entire time of bein hashmashot [the time of  which we are unsure whether it is day or night] will certainly pass, and I said to look [in]to this [matter], with the help of Heaven.",
