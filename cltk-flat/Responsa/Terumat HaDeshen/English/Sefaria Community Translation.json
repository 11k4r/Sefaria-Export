        "1_Part I, 91_Siman, 0_Seif": "<b>Question 92</b> He who has a very narrow Sukkah to sleep in, such that he cannot sleep with his body and legs outstretched, is he considered <i>mitzta'er</i> (=suffering) in such circumstances or not?", 
        "1_Part I, 91_Siman, 1_Seif": "<b>Answer:</b> It would seem, that he is not exempt from sleeping in the Sukkah through this [case which might be] <i>mitzta'er</i>. And it seems to me, to bring a proof, from that rule that the size of a Sukkah is at least 7 handbreadths, and the size of the body of a regular person is 3 cubits, which are 18 handbreadths, as is found in the Chapter [of Eruvin] 'Mi Shehotzi'uhu'. And in the Chapter 'HaMatznia' (Tosafot on Shabbat 92a.44.1) about he who carries a load above 10 [handbreadths] Tosafot proved that the body of a man without his head is 18 handbreadths, and such also seems apparent there from Rashi's commentary. And if so, even when you look at the diagonal of 7 by 7 [handbreadths, the minimum size of a Sukkah], that is 9.8 handbreadths, and we require, whether for eating or sleeping, that the head of a person and most of his body be in the Sukkah, and his head and most of his body is more than 10 handbreadths, according to the calculation above. And how could the Sages give a minimum size for a Sukkah which someone cannot sleep in with his head and most of his body within the Sukkah? And even though it may be fit to eat in, Rabbi Eliezer of Metz wrote, brought in the Mordekhai (Sukkah 740), that a Sukkah which is not fit to sleep in, even if it is fit to eat and drink in, one does not fulfill his obligation with it at all, rather it must be that it is normal once in a while to sleep curled up, and it is not considered <i>mitzta'er</i>.", 
        "1_Part I, 0_Siman, 1_Seif": "Answer: It is not in our hands to settle this problem, or to find a reason for this tradition to say Maariv so much earlier, 3 or 4 hours. For Rabbenu Tam wrote that from Plag HaMincha and onwards is considered night, according to R' Yehuda, and from that point onward the obligation of Shema and Maariv can be fulfilled. And it is written by the Mordechai, and in the Hagahot Maimuniyot, and the Ravyah wrote that the words of Rabbenu Tam are primary [i.e. the law follows him in this case], and he who is stringent and takes it upon himself to wait until the the stars come out as is said by the other great ones, it is seen is arrogance and he is called a mere layman if he is isn't consistently more stringent upon himself. Anyhow, this time [Plag HaMincha] is merely an hour and a quarter before the stars come out; but what is the source to pray Maariv so much earlier? And when I was young I saw in Tosafot on the first chapter of Berachot that there are those who wish to say that in the days of summer, when the days are long, we calculate the hours of the night as small hours, and the hours of the day as long hours, so that there will always be twelve hours of night and twelve hours of day.", 
        "1_Part I, 0_Siman, 0_Seif": "Question: In most communities it is practiced in the long days of summer to read the evening Shema, and to pray the evening prayer, 3 or 4 hours before the stars come out. Is there a way to reconcile this practice, or a reason for this practice, since many scholars practice this along with the masses?"
