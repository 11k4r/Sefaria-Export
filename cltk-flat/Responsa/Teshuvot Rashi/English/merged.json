        "172_Teshuva, 1_Paragraph": "It makes no difference whether the husband betrothed her and then [the brother-in-law] apostatized, or whether he apostatized before the betrothal, because an apostate is a Jew, who is suspect on all matters. For it is stated: “‘Israel has sinned’—though he has sinned, he remains of Israel” (Sanhedrin 44a). He should not be excluded from the law of  Israel, although he has no credibility vis-à-vis prohibitions, since he is suspected of violating them, and his wine is rendered libation wine (yeyn nesekh) since he is suspected of idolatry. Yet his betrothal is valid, and his halitza is valid.", 
        "172_Teshuva, 2_Paragraph": "As a rule, he is considered a suspect Jew. The responsum found amongst the responsa of the Ge’onim, namely, that if he had apostatized by the time of the betrothal she does not require halitza since the initial betrothal and marriage cause her to be bound to halitza or levirate marriage, is unreliable, as it is self-contradictory. For if his bond is considered binding and his halitza valid even after his apostasy, what does it matter whether she was betrothed before or after? He is considered a bona fide Jew whose halitza is valid.", 
        "172_Teshuva, 0_Paragraph": "Rashi responded: A levirate widow (yevama) who is bound to an apostate brother-in-law requires levirate divorce (halitza).", 
        "172_Teshuva, 3_Paragraph": "Therefore, there is no remedy for her except halitza, and may the Rock of Israel illuminate our eyes with the light of His Torah."
