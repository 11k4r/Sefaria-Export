        "46_Daf, 2_Comment": "\"And Rav Chisda says, the leg of a woman is nakedness\". And specifically [it is nakedness] to others and to men, because of [sexual] thoughts, but to herself it is not, as we teach (Mishna Challah 2:3) \"A woman may sit and separate challah naked\" (implying she may make the accompanying blessing whilst naked). And so with Rabbi Yitzchak's statement, \"a handbreadth of a woman is nakedness\" -- the scope of his statement is narrow and applies specifically with a man's own wife and [whilst he, the husband, is] saying Shema. The Ra'avad of blessed memory analyses this: it is possible specifically in a private place she comes, and it arises Rav Chisda's saying that the thigh of a woman is a hidden place and is nakedness -- but even on the back of her husband, even though this is not a hidden place on a man. But her face and her feet and her voice when it speaks and does not sing, and her hair that comes out of her braid and isn't covered, we aren't concerned about them because he is accustomed to seeing them and won't be distracted. And with another woman, it is forbidden to stare at her because of the place, and even her little finger or her hair, and forbidden to hear her even when she is speaking, as we said in Kiddushin 70a; \"'Let the Master send greetings to Yalta,' and he said to him, 'This is what Shmuel says: the voice of a woman is nakedness'\". And rather it appears that this is specifically the voice of sending or returning greetings, since the reason [of the prohibition?] is closeness of mind. And the Rav Alfasi of blessed memory, that he should not be recalled for this at all, wrote the Raavad of blessed memory that it is possible that this is because we said, see the letters, that this is not because of nakedness. The Rav of Blessed Memory thought this is all because a handbreadth of her thigh and hair and voice is nakedness. And he of blessed memory wrote that this is not from there he, rather because of distraction and with sight, and the letters (about?) separation specifically from herself, and with his wife that he doesn't see and even to touch, that all of this is not about sight but about touching only, he is not distracted perhaps he is proud/inflated of her.
