        "214_Daf, 1_Line, 3_Comment": "If there is a drop of taste into the pot - That is to say; the drop has no strength to make everything forbidden, unless it gives taste to the whole pot.", 
        "214_Daf, 1_Line, 2_Comment": "Stir the pot - Stir it immediately before the piece [of meat] receives taste from the drop [of dairy] because it will have been stirred, the drop, with everything.", 
        "208_Daf, 5_Line, 1_Comment": "It is forbidden to eat cheese - Because meat exudes fat that stays in the mouth and the taste stays in the mouth.", 
        "9_Daf, 4_Line, 1_Comment": "They are mentally crafty â€“ like the first human; but they consider themselves as animals, lowly in spirit.", 
        "214_Daf, 8_Line, 0_Comment": "In a thick broth - [with] finely [cut] meat [throughout], and fat [in it], such that the entire [broth] is [considered] a type of meat.", 
        "214_Daf, 3_Line, 0_Comment": "That if you should think - in all other prohibitions [deriving from] its taste are from the rabbis [\"derabanan\"] and we do not learn them from [the Torah prohibition against] milk in meat.", 
        "214_Daf, 5_Line, 1_Comment": "Because they are the same type of substance - Rav holds like Rabbi Yehuda who said that min b'mino does not nullify.", 
        "214_Daf, 1_Line, 0_Comment": "Mishna: A drop of dairy that falls upon a piece [of meat] - Inside the pot upon one piece [of meat among several] and it the pot is not stirred; it [the pot] will not acquire the taste of the drop, rather only the piece by itself.", 
        "214_Daf, 5_Line, 0_Comment": "Rav said - This is because we learned in the Mishnah \"if a drop of milk falls on a slice of meat and imparts a flavor to it\" it invalidates the whole pot, since that piece itself becomes entirely prohibited and prohibits the other pieces. Even if they consist of [enough volume] to nullify [the drop], they are all prohibited.", 
        "214_Daf, 1_Line, 1_Comment": "If it [the drop of dairy] gives taste to a piece [of meat] - that is to say; [if] the piece of meat by itself is not 60 times larger, to nullify the drop, the piece is immediately forbidden.  And the remaining pieces in the pot are not discussed by the Tanna of our Mishna.  The Gemara argues if the piece returns and makes [all pieces] forbidden or not."
