        "214_Daf, 4_Line, 1_Comment": "If there is a drop of taste into the pot - That is to say; the drop has no strength to make everything forbidden, unless it gives taste to the whole pot.", 
        "208_Daf, 22_Line, 0_Comment": "It is forbidden to eat cheese - Because meat exudes fat that stays in the mouth and the taste stays in the mouth.", 
        "214_Daf, 3_Line, 1_Comment": "If it [the drop of dairy] gives taste to a piece [of meat] - that is to say; [if] the piece of meat by itself is not 60 times larger, to nullify the drop, the piece is immediately forbidden.  And the remaining pieces in the pot are not discussed by the Tanna of our Mishna.  The Gemara argues if the piece returns and makes [all pieces] forbidden or not.", 
        "214_Daf, 3_Line, 0_Comment": "Mishna: A drop of dairy that falls upon a piece [of meat] - Inside the pot upon one piece [of meat among several] and it the pot is not stirred; it [the pot] will not acquire the taste of the drop, rather only the piece by itself."
