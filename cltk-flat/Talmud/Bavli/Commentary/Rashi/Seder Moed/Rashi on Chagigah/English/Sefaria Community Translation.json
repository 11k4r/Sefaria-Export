We can learn from here that we annul [the vow] for one who finds a hole in his vow, sayin, \"I did not make the vow with this in mind - that what I see coming to me because of my vow, would come to me.\"", 
        "18_Daf, 3_Line, 0_Comment": "[Regarding] the annulment of vows about which the Sages said that a sage may annul a vow, there is [only] a scant hint in Scripture, so it does not have what to be based upon. Rather, such was passed on the Sages in the Oral Law."
