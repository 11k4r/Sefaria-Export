He may be required to take part in yibbum, and he may release himself from the obligation. If a limb is severed from his body, it is a limb from a living person; and his flesh like that of a living person. And the blood of his sin offering may be sprinkled on his behalf until he dies.",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 1_Halakhah": "No knot may be tied round his jaw. And his extremities may not be blocked. And they may not place a cool metal tool on his naval till his death as it is said: \"till the silver cord snaps And the golden bowl crashes, The jar is shattered at the spring, And the jug is smashed at the cistern.\" (Ecclesiastes 12:6)",
