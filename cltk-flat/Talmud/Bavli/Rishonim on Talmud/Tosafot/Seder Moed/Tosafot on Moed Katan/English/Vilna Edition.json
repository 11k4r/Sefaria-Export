Gamliel was meticulous about why the traditions about Tosefes Shevi'is and Nisuch ha'Mayim were taught together; Everywhere, these three Halachos (including also Aravah) are taught together. They were given [to Moshe] this way. Surely, Hash-m did so to teach [that all of them apply only when the Mikdash stands]."
