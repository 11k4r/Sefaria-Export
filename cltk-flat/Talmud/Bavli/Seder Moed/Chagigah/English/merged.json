        "42_Daf, 13_Line": "The Gemara asks: If so, in the case of <b><i>teruma</i></b><b> he will also have </b>feelings of <b>antagonism </b>if <i>teruma</i> is not accepted from him. Why were the Sages concerned about this factor only with regard to sacrificial food and not <i>teruma</i>? The Gemara replies: An <i>am</i> <i>ha’aretz</i> <b>does not care </b>if his <i>teruma</i> is not accepted by <i>ḥaverim</i>, <b>as </b>he can always <b>go </b>and <b>give</b> his <i>teruma</i> <b>to an </b><b><i>am</i></b> <b><i>ha’aretz</i></b><b> priest </b>who is <b>his friend </b>and who will accept it from him. In the case of sacrificial food, however, there is only one Temple, and care must be taken not to make the <i>amei</i> <i>ha’aretz</i> feel they are being rejected. ",

In other words, one might think that immersion in a flood of rainwater effects purification, whereas the <i>halakha</i> is that rainwater purifies only if it is gathered in one location. <b>Alternatively, </b>you might think that <b>it should be decreed </b>that purification by means of <b>the edges </b>of the waves that comes in contact with the ground should be ineffective <b>due to </b>the upper <b>arcs </b>of the waves.

        "36_Daf, 15_Line": "In relation to the above, the Gemara explains: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught </b>that one <b>whose foot is</b><b> still in the water </b>is considered to be still immersing himself? <b>Rabbi Pedat said: It is </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b><b> Yehuda, as we learned </b>in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:6): In the case of <b>a ritual bath that was measure</b><b>d</b> <b>and </b>found to <b>contain exactly forty </b><b><i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>and </b>then <b>two </b>individuals <b>descended and immersed one after the </b><b>other, the first one is ritually pure, </b>since he immersed in a valid ritual bath, <b>but the second is ritually </b><b>impure. </b>Because a small amount of water clings to the first individual, the ritual bath subsequently holds less than the requisite amount. Therefore, it does not purify the second individual. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: If the feet of the first </b><b>one were </b>still <b>touching the water, </b>so that he had not yet exited the ritual bath entirely while the second one immersed, <b>the second is also ritually pure. </b>This teaches that Rabbi Yehuda is of the opinion that one who still has a foot in the water is considered to be inside the ritual bath.",

For <b><i>ḥaverim</i></b><b>, </b>individuals devoted to the meticulous observance of mitzvot, especially <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity. Others do not carefully follow these <i>halakhot</i> in any event. And <b><i>ḥaverim</i></b><b> know </b>such things <b>well, </b>that water is considered detached from the ritual bath if it is separated by a narrow opening, and that if one vessel is weighing down on another, preventing the water from reaching that spot, the top vessel must be lifted to allow the water to touch all parts of the vessel. Therefore, there is no need to apply these concerns and stringencies to the case of <i>teruma</i>.",
