There is a [halachic] difference between them, where it is written on the wall high up. According to the one who says \"lest one comes to erase\", we would not be concerned [in this case].

Rather, this is the [halachic] difference between them, where it is written on the wall low down. According to the one who says, \"lest one comes to erase\", we are concerned. According to the one who says \"lest one comes to read...\", we are not concerned, a wall and a document will not be confused.

According to the on who says \"lest one comes to read...\", we would be concerned. And the one who says \"lest he comes to erase\", let him be concerned of \"lest he comes to read...\"! If you'll say that [he believes] a tablet or a board would not be confused for a document, but it is taught [in a baraita], \"One can count [guests], how many will be inside and how many will be outside, and how many portions will he place before them, [only] from something written upon a wall, but not something written upon a tablet or board\"! What is the case? If you say it is something written [in ink on the wall/tablet], what is the difference here [with a wall] or here [with a tablet]? Rather, is it not engraved [on the wall/tablet]? But it states, \"something written UPON the wall, but not something written UPON a tablet or board\"! Rather, really it is written on a wall, high up [as first suggested]. And your question because of Rabbah, Rabbah is but [a contender] in a Tannaic argument, as it is taught [in a baraita], \"One can count his guests and his extra portions verbally, but not from something written. Rav Acha permitted [counting] from something written upon a wall.\" What is the case? If you say it is on the wall low down, let [Rav Acha] be concerned of \"lest on come to erase\"! Rather, it is surely on the wall, high up. And learn from it that Rabbah is [a contender] in a Tannaic argument, learn from it. And this Tannaic argument is like another Tannaic argument, as it is taught [in a baraita], \"One may not look into a mirror on the Sabbath [lest one feels the need to cut ones hair, and does it despite the Sabbath]. Rabbi Meir permitted a mirror that is set on a wall.\" Why does it matter if it is set [or not]? Because while [he is trying to find a scissor] he will remember [it is the Sabbath]. If it is not set, he will also remember! [Whether it is set should not make a difference!] Here, we are dealing with a metal mirror, and according to that of Rabbi Nachman, in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha, for Rabbi Nachman said in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha, \"Why did they say that a metal mirror is prohibited? Because a person will cut thin hairs using it['s sharp edges].\" Our rabbis taught [in a baraita], \"Writing that goes under a painting or a bust, it is forbidden to read it on the Sabbath. And the bust itself is forbidden to gaze at even during the week,  as it says, 'Do not turn to idols...' [Leviticus 19:4].\" How is this learned?

And he said, 'I will go out and I will be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' And He said, 'You will entice, and you will be able. Go out and do it.'\" [I Kings 22:20-22].

For Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: \"When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man\" [and thus, he was forced to punish him]!
