'Hidka adduced their opinions from the same passage, as follows [Exodus xvi. 25]: \"And Moses said, Eat it to-day; for a Sabbath is this day unto the Lord: to-day ye will not find it in the field.\" R. 'Hidka holds that, day being mentioned three times, three meals should be eaten during the day and one at night, and the rabbis hold that the day includes the night and only three meals are required. Our Mishna, however, which decrees that only enough for three meals should be saved, does therefore not agree with R. 'Hidka. According to whose opinion, however, will the following Mishna be? (Tract Peah): \"If a poor man have sufficient for two meals, he must not apply for another at the public kitchen (where food is distributed), but he may apply to the general charity fund. If he have, however, sufficient for fourteen meals (for the week) he must not even apply to the general charity fund!\" If the Mishna were of the opinion of R. 'Hidka, he should have had sufficient for sixteen meals, so as to afford him four meals on the Sabbath, and, according to the rabbis, for fifteen meals in order to have three meals on the Sabbath? It is therefore neither in accord with R. 'Hidka nor with the rabbis. Nay; it is in accord with the rabbis, and the poor man should eat his Sabbath-night meal on the Sabbath day, so with his Friday-night meal it will make three meals on the Sabbath. It may also be said that the Mishna holds with R. 'Hidka, and that the poor man should leave his Friday meal for the Sabbath. Shall we make the poor man then fast on Friday? It would therefore be better to hold the Mishna's opinion to be in accord with R. Aqiba, who says, that the poor man should make Sabbath equal to a weekday in order not to be forced to rely upon charity. Thus fourteen meals are sufficient, and he may eat only two on Sabbath.",

How do we know this? If you'll say it's because of what's written, \"And God said, 'Who will entice Achav, so he will go up and fall at Ramot-Gilad?' and one said this and one said that, and a spirit went out and stood before God, and he said, 'I will entice him'... And he said, 'I will go out and I will be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' And He said, 'You will entice, and you will be able. Go out and do it.'\" [I Kings 22:20-22]. And we say [on that], what is this \"spirit\"? The spirit of Navot [whom Achav had killed]. And what is this \"go out\"? Rav said: \"Go out from my borders\" [thus, the spirit was banned from God's borders because he caused Achav's downfall]. But perhaps over there, the reason was because of that which is written, \"He who is deceitful shall not dwell within\" [Psalms 101:7]? Rather, [the source of Rav Yaakov's statement is] from here, \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor. You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised....\" [Habakkuk 2:16]: \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor\": That is Nevuchadnezzar. \"You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised\": That is Tzidkiyah [and since he caused Nevuchadnezzar to be punished, he is considered \"uncircumcised\"]. First of all, the whole verse is referring to Nevuchadnezzar! And furthermore, what should the righteous Tzidkiyah have done for him? For Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: \"When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man\" [and thus, he was forced to punish him]! Rather, [Rav Yaakov's source is] from here, \"Punishment to the righteous is not good\" [Proverbs 17:26], \"not good\" can only mean \"wicked\", [and this applies to the righteous who punish others], and it is written, \"For You are not a God Who desires wickedness; evil does not abide with You\" [Psalms 5:5].

Said Rabha: Because a man is anxious for his possessions, he might, if allowed to save as much as possible, forget about the Sabbath and extinguish the fire altogether. Said Abayi to him: \"We have learned previously, that a man upon whose roof a barrel filled with victuals becomes broken, may bring another vessel and put it underneath the barrel in order that the contents of the barrel fall into the vessel, but may not bring another barrel and transfer the contents of the broken one into the new, nor may he place a new barrel alongside of the other and remove the contents of the broken one into the new one by keeling over the former and letting its contents drop into the latter. Why should he not be allowed to do this? (He is on private ground, and the barrel with its contents may be handled?) If it is prohibited as a precautionary measure in the manner of the previous case, where does the precaution arise?\" This latter case is also a precautionary measure; for were he allowed to remove the contents from one barrel into another, there is fear of his carrying it through public ground. The text of the Boraitha, how ever, teaches further, that if the man had guests in his house, he may remove the contents of the broken barrel into a new one, etc. But he may not first remove the contents and then call guests, but first call guests and then remove the things; nor may he pretend (to call guests), but must actually desire their company.

And according to the one who says \"lest one comes to erase\", let him be concerned for \"lest one come to read...\"!

According to the on who says \"lest one comes to read...\", we would be concerned. And the one who says \"lest he comes to erase\", let him be concerned of \"lest he comes to read...\"! If you'll say that [he believes] a tablet or a board would not be confused for a document, but it is taught [in a baraita], \"One can count [guests], how many will be inside and how many will be outside, and how many portions will he place before them, [only] from something written upon a wall, but not something written upon a tablet or board\"! What is the case? If you say it is something written [in ink on the wall/tablet], what is the difference here [with a wall] or here [with a tablet]? Rather, is it not engraved [on the wall/tablet]? But it states, \"something written UPON the wall, but not something written UPON a tablet or board\"! Rather, really it is written on a wall, high up [as first suggested]. And your question because of Rabbah, Rabbah is but [a contender] in a Tannaic argument, as it is taught [in a baraita], \"One can count his guests and his extra portions verbally, but not from something written. Rav Acha permitted [counting] from something written upon a wall.\" What is the case? If you say it is on the wall low down, let [Rav Acha] be concerned of \"lest on come to erase\"! Rather, it is surely on the wall, high up. And learn from it that Rabbah is [a contender] in a Tannaic argument, learn from it. And this Tannaic argument is like another Tannaic argument, as it is taught [in a baraita], \"One may not look into a mirror on the Sabbath [lest one feels the need to cut ones hair, and does it despite the Sabbath]. Rabbi Meir permitted a mirror that is set on a wall.\" Why does it matter if it is set [or not]? Because while [he is trying to find a scissor] he will remember [it is the Sabbath]. If it is not set, he will also remember! [Whether it is set should not make a difference!] Here, we are dealing with a metal mirror, and according to that of Rabbi Nachman, in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha, for Rabbi Nachman said in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha, \"Why did they say that a metal mirror is prohibited? Because a person will cut thin hairs using it['s sharp edges].\" Our rabbis taught [in a baraita], \"Writing that goes under a painting or a bust, it is forbidden to read it on the Sabbath. And the bust itself is forbidden to gaze at even during the week,  as it says, 'Do not turn to idols...' [Leviticus 19:4].\" How is this learned?
