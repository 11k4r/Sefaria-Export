If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one did not recite: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He makes the rain fall, we require him to return </span>and repeat the blessing. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And not only that, but even </span>if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>mistakenly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">recited: He removes the wind and lifts</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the dew, </span>i.e., that there should be no wind or dew, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we do not require him to return </span>and repeat the blessing, because wind and dew are always present.",

Accordingly, Shmuel, who lived in the lowlands of Babylonia, ruled that one begins to request for rain later, whereas Rav, who studied in Eretz Yisrael, which is higher in elevation and has a greater need for rain, stated an earlier date. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Pappa said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: The </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">halakha</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is </span>that the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sixtieth day </span>is part <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of </span>the period <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sixtieth </span>day, as stated by <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav, </span>and therefore one begins to mention the request for rain on the sixtieth day after the autumnal equinox.",
