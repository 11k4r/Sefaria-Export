The verse is interpreted homiletically: <b>“To </b><b>do”; these are the actions </b>performed in the burning of <b>the </b>red <b>heifer </b>for which the priest performing the ritual is sequestered seven days in advance; <b>“to make atonement”; these</b><b> are the actions </b>performed on <b>Yom Kippur, </b>before which the High Priest is sequestered seven days.",
