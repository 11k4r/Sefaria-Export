This means that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">apparently, a husband can nullif</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">y</span> a wife’s vow not to adorn herself. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises a contradiction </span>from a different mishna (<span class=\"it-text\">Nedarim</span> 79a): <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">These are the cases </span>of a wife’s vow <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that the husband may nullify: Cases </span>of vows <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that involve affliction, </span>such as when the woman says: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If I bathe, </span>I forbid myself to benefit from it; or if she says: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If I do not bathe, </span>i.e., she vows not to bathe at all; or she vows: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If I adorn </span>myself; or vows: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If I do not adorn </span>myself, all of which cause her to suffer. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei said: These are not vows of affliction</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> which the husband may nullify, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but </span>rather, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these, </span>i.e., the following, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are vows of affliction: </span>Such as when she vows <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that I will not eat meat, or that I will not drink wine, or </span>even <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that I will not adorn myself</span>",
