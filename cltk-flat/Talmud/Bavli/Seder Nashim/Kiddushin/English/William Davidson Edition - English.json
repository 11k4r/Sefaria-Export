Why can a young woman accept the former but not receive a bill of divorce, when both levirate betrothal and divorce can be performed without her consent?

Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: </span>“And if his offering to the Lord is a burnt-offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from birds”</span> (Leviticus 1:14).
