        "0_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "From when may one recite Shema in the evening? From the time the Kohanim go in to eat their Terumah (produce consecrated for priestly consumption). Until the end of the first watch, says Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say: Until [astronomical] midnight. Rabban Gamliel says: Until the break of dawn. It once happened that his [Rabban Gamliel’s] sons came from a house of feasting. They said to him: We have not recited Shema. He to them: If dawn has not broken, you are obligated to recite it. And it is not only in this case that they said it! Rather, in all cases where the Sages said \"only until midnight,\" the obligation remains until the break of dawn. [e.g.] Burning the fats and limbs [of the sacrifices, on the Temple altar] — the obligation is until the break of dawn. [e.g.:] All [sacrifices] which may be eaten for one day — the obligation is until the break of dawn. If that is so, why did the Sages say, \"until midnight?\" To distance a person from transgression.",
        "0_Daf, 1_Halakhah": "We recite [in our mishnah] \"...from the time that the kohanim (Aaronide priests) enter to eat their Terumah (produce consecrated for priestly consumption).\" Rabbi Chiya taught [in Tosefta Berakhot 1:1]: \"...from the time that people usually go in to eat their bread on the eve of the Sabbath.\" And there is a baraita that comments on this: \"These opinions are close enough to be equal.\"",
        "1_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "Come and see, [let us test this hypothesis by implication from our mishnah]: \"...from the time that the Kohanim go in to eat their terumah.\" It is [still close to] daytime. It is as soon as the stars come out!? [and the Tosefta says:] \"...from the time when people usually go in to eat their bread on the eve of the Sabbath.\" That is an hour or two after nightfall! [These are obviously two very different times.] And yet you say: \"These opinions are close enough to be equal!?\" --Rabbi Yose said: \"Let the problem be resolved [by claiming that the Tosefta refers only] to those small villages whose way is to go on up [home] while it is still day, to spare themselves from the animals.\"    ",
        "1_Daf, 1_Halakhah": "It teaches in a Baraita: \"The one who recites [the Shema] before this has not fulfilled their obligation. If so, why do we recite it [before nightfall] in the synagogue? Rabbi Yose said: 'We do not recite it in the synagogue to fulfill its obligation. Rather, [we recite it] so that we may stand up in prayer after a word of Torah.\"  Rabbi Zeira in the name of Rav Yirmiyah: \"If there is doubt whether he made the blessings after his food or not, he should make the blessings [even though he may be doing it a second time]. For it is written (Deut. 8:10) 'And you shall eat, and you shall be satisfied, then you shall bless [the LORD your God...]' If there is doubt whether he prayed or not, he should not pray [as he may have already done so.]\" But he disagrees with Rabbi Yohanan. For Rabbi Yohanan said: \"If  only a person could pray the entire day!\" Why? For prayer is never a waste. If there is doubt whether he recited [Shema] or not, we may gather from this baraita: \"The one who recites [the Shema] before this has not fulfilled their obligation.\" And is not before [nightfall] a time of doubt? And yet you say \"he should recite [Shema].\" This implies that if there is doubt whether he recited [Shema] or not, he should recite [Shema]. [From Tosefta 1:1] \"The indicator of this is when the stars come out. And though there is no proof of it [from Scripture], there is a trace of it: (Neh. 4:21) '...we were doing the labor, and half of them were holding the spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.' And he writes: '...it is guard-time for us by night and labor by day.\" How many stars should come out so that it becomes night? Rabbi Pinhas in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Papa: \"One star, surely day. Two, doubt. Three, surely night.\" \"...two doubt,\" [really]? But is it not written, \"...until the stars came out!?\" Rather, [the plural] \"stars\" indicates two! [Not three!]--The first one doesn't count. [An unattributed baraita:] \"If he sees one star on the eve of the Sabbath and performs a creative task, he is exempt [from punishment]. Two, he brings a conditional guilt offering, Three, he brings a sin offering. On the departure of the Sabbath, if he sees on star and performs a creative task, ",
        "2_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "a creative task, he should bring a sin offering. Two--he should bring a conditional sin offering. Three--he is exempt [from bringing a sacrifice of any sort.]” Rabbi Yose bar Bon raised the question [thus]: “If you were to say that two [stars indicate] doubt [as to whether it is day or night, then] if one saw two stars on the eve of the Sabbath and [others] warned him [that it was the Sabbath, thus making him liable for its violation], yet he [nonetheless] performed a creative task; [and if he subsequently] saw two stars on the departure of the Sabbath and [others] warned him [that it was still the Sabbath], yet he performed a creative task; then either way you like [he is liable for a violation of the Sabbath]. If the first [set of stars] were [an indication that it was still] daytime [and not yet the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was still] daytime [and still the Sabbath], then he is liable [for a violation of the Sabbath] on account of the last set [of stars]. If the last [set of stars] were [an indication that it was now] night time [and the Sabbath had begun], then the first stars were also [an indication that it was now] night time [and no longer the Sabbath], then he is liable [for a violation of the Sabbath] on account of the first set [of stars]. [Another example:] If he saw two stars on the eve of the Sabbath and partially harvested a fig, [and] if he [subsequently returned] in the morning and harvested another part, and if he saw two stars on the departure of the Sabbath and harvested the [last] part of the fig, then either way you like [he is liable for a sin offering]. If the first [set of stars] were [an indication that it was still] daytime [and not yet the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was still] daytime [and still the Sabbath] and the morning harvest joins with that of the departure of the sabbath, and he is liable [for a sin offering] on account of the last set [of stars]. If the last [set of stars] were [an indication that it was] night time [and now the Sabbath], then the last stars were also [an indication that it was] daytime [and no longer the Sabbath] and the morning harvest joins with that of the night of the Sabbath, and he is liable [for a sin offering] on account of the first set [of stars].” These [stars] that you are speaking of are [only] those whose way is not to appear in the daytime. However, we do not count those whose way is to appear in the daytime. Rabbi Yose bar Bon said: “Just so long as three stars may be seen aside from that [one we call] Kokhvata (prob. Venus).” (This may be a scribal error and the original version may have been: “Just so long as three stars may be seen [in one place, just] as one star [can be so seen.]”) Rabbi Yaakov of Romana in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi: “One star, surely day. Two, night.” But does he [truly] have no [time period of] doubt!? He has doubt about [discerning] one star from another. A baraita teaches: “So long as the eastern horizon is reddened, it is daytime.",
        "2_Daf, 1_Halakhah": "What has been said about the stars, applies to those which are not generally seen until nightfall; for, no note is taken of those which appear before the day is terminated. Therefore, R. Yosse bar R. Aboon says: It means three stars not counting, R. Jacob from Darom (south) says: One star indicates that it is still day; but two stars certainly show that it is night. Is there any doubt of this? No; the doubt can only exist between the stars visible by day, and the other stars.",
        "2_Daf, 2_Halakhah": "With regard to this, we are taught that it is still day as long as the sky is red towards the east;",
        "3_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "If it becomes shadowy, the intermediate period (twilight) has arrived. If darkness has set in, so that the upper atmosphere has become indistinguishable from the lower, night has arrived. Rabbi says: When, at the period of the new moon, the sun commences to go down and the moon to appear, it is twilight.",
        "4_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "R. Hanina says: The sun must have gone down and the moon have commenced to rise. In effect R. Samuel says: The moon cannot shine as long as the sun still lightens, neither can the moon shine after the sun has darted his (morning) beams. R. Samuel bar-Hiya, in the name of R. Hanina, says: If a man, when the sun has begun to set, descends from the summit of Mount Carmel to bathe in the sea, and re-ascends to partake of the oblations, he has certainly bathed during the daytime. It is, however, only a certainty in the case of one taking cross-roads to shorten the route; but not in the case of one who follows the high road (Strata). What is meant by \"the intermediate period \"? R. Tanhooma says: It resembles the delay of a drop of blood placed on the edge of a sword, i.e. the time required for the drop of blood to divide and run down on either side of the blade, is equivalent to the period of transition. According to R. Nehemiah, it means the time it would require for a man to run half a mile, after sunset. R. Yosse says: This twilight lasts no longer than the twinkling of an eye, and not even the men of science could measure it.",
        "4_Daf, 1_Halakhah": "Whilst the R. Yosse and R. Aha were together, the former said to the latter: Does it not seem to you that the passage of this half a mile (twilight) lasts but a second? It is certainly my opinion, said R. Aha. However, R. Hiya does not say so, but each twinkling of an eye, measured by the duration of the passage of half a mile (as R. Nehemiah), is doubtful. R. Mena says : I have made an objection in the presence of R. Aha: Have we not learnt elsewhere, that if an impurity is seen, once during the day and again during the intermediate period, or once in the twilight and again on the morrow, when the certainty exists that the impurity dates partly from this day and partly from the next day, there is a certainty as to the circumstances of the impurity, and the sacrifice is obligatory. ",
        "5_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "But if the doubt exists, that the sight of the impurity dates partly from to-day and partly from the morrow, the impurity is certain, but the sacrifice uncertain. On account of this, R. Hiya bar-Joseph answered in the presence of B. Yohanan: Who is it who taught that one of these occasions of impurity can be divided into two? It was R. Yosse. He answered: You thus refute your own opinion; for you say that each twinkling of an eye of the time accomplished in a half-mile, according to R. Nehemiah, is doubtful, and not only the end of it. No contradiction can be offered to this; when the Prophet Elijah shall return to this world, and will explain to us what this twilight means, no one will contest him. R. Hanina argued against the disciples of the Rabbis: Since, said he, it is night as soon as three stars are visible, be the sun still high in the heavens, the same must apply (before the day) in the morning. R. Abba said: It is written (in Gen. xix. 23) : \"The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar;\" and is written (in Lev. xxii. 7): \"And when the sun is down he shall be clean.\" The sunrise is compared with the sunset: As sunset corresponds to the disappearance of the sun from the sight of man, so also sunrise is manifested by the appearance of the sun to the eye of man.",
        "6_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "R. Aha said: It is written (in Gen. xliv. 3): \"As soon as the morning was light.\" The Tori calls the light \"morning.\" R. Ishmael taught: It is written \"every morning,\" so as to give a limit for him who desires to know when the morning commences. R. Yosse bar R. Aboon said: If you think to call night, the time that the sun takes to traverse the heavens (from dawn to radiancy), it would be equivalent to saying that the day and the night do not resemble each other (the night would lengthen out to the morning by this addition; but we are taught that on the first day of the Equinox of Nissan ', and on the first day of the Equinox of Tissri, the day and the night are equal). R. Hoona says: One can accept the usual custom as a term of comparison. Thus, when the king starts to go out, he is said to be out; but when he commences to return, he is not said to be returned, until it is an accomplished fact (it is the same with the sun).",
        "6_Daf, 1_Halakhah": "In standing up to recite the Prayer ('Amida), the feet must be met. There are two opinions on this subject, viz. that of R. Levi, and that of R. Shimon. The one says: it is to imitate the angels; the other says: it is to imitate the priests. The latter opinion is founded on the verse, \" Neither shalt thou go up by steps to mine altar\" (Exod. xx. 2); for the priests had to go to the altar by placing the toe beside the heel, and the heel beside the toe (i.e. by taking very little steps). The former opinion is based on the verse, \" And their feet were straight feet\" (Ezek. i. 7). Now, II. Hanina bar-Andira, in the name of R. Samuel bar-Zootai, says : The angels have no knee-joint, according to (Dan. vii. 16), \" I came near unto one of them, that stood (always) by.'\" R. Hoona says: If one sees the priests in the Synagogue at the time of their first blessing of the people, one must say: «' Bless the Lord, ye his angels\" (Ps. ciii. 20); if at the second benediction: \"Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts\" (Ps. ciii. 21); if at the third benediction: \"Bless the Lord, all his works\" (Ps. ciii. 22).

        "28_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "This reinforces what Rabbi Yitzhak said about Rabbi Yohanan: that until the bath-keeper Yaakov came, he wore them [tefillin]. Rabbi Yirmiya asked before Rabbi Zeira: What if the bathhouse was used for bathing during the hot days (i.e., summer) but not used for bathing during the rainy days (i.e., winter)? He said to him: a bathhouse, even if not used for bathing, [is analogous to the rules] for a bathroom that does not contain feces. Mar Ukva said: a pig is like a moving bathroom. Rabbi Yonah inquired: what is [the law] for a pebble [with feces on it] that is on the sea shore? Rabbi Ammi the doctor said: Rabbi Yirmiya taught that one should pass it while covered in a scarf; this ruling is rejected. Rabbi Zeira, in the name of Abba bar Yirmiya:  one may eat a snack with [tefillin] on, but not a meal. [Similarly, one may] take a nap, but not sleep with them on. There are tannaitic rabbis who teach: One says a blessing once. There are tannaitic rabbis who teach: One says a blessing twice. How is the one who said  once be correct? The one who said that one blesses twice [says so because] he ate and they aren't on him. Rabbi Zeira said that Abba bar Yirmiya [is referring] to a person that only eats snacks. Rabbi Zeira, in the name of Rabbi Abba: A person should not enter a urinal if a [holy] book and tefillin are in his hands. When Rabbi Yohanan had a book in his hand [and wanted to urinate] he would give it to someone else. When he had on his tefillin, he would stand with them. A baraita argues against Abba bar Yirmiya: a person may enter a urinal if a book and tefillin are in his hands. Rabbi Zeira said that Abba bar Yirmiya [is referring to two cases, one applies] to someone who can wear them, [and the other] to someone who cannot wear them. After all, why should he spoil them if cannot even fulfill the commandment? Initially, people would give them [tefillin] to other people, but those people would take them and run away.

        "33_Daf, 0_Halakhah": "The Rabbis say : As for the King Messiah, whether he be among the living  or the dead. He shall be called David (meaning whether he exist or no, he will  be of a royal stock). According to R. Tunhooma, the reason would be this (Ps. xviii. 60) : \" Great deliverance giveth lie to His king, to David His anointed '.\" R. Joshua ben Levi says : His name shall be Tsemah; and according to R. Judan, son of R. Aibo: It shall be Menahem (comforter). ' R. Hanina, son of Abahoo, says : You must not conclude that these two opinions contradict each other, for  m fact these two names are the same ^ The following tale which we have from R. Judan, son of R. Aibo, proves it : One day, an Israelite, whilst cultivating his held, heard his cow cry out; an Arab, who was passing, also heard her : Son of Juda, cried he, son of Juda ! quit thy cow, quit thy plough, for the Temple is destroyed (and thou shalt either mourn or flee, instead of till the earth). The cow bellowed a second time. Son of Juda, said the Arab, son of Juda ! take back thy cow and thy plough, for the King, the Messiah, has just been born. What is his name? Menahem. And what is his father's name? Ezeckiel. And from whence does he come? From the royal town of Eethlem in Judea^ The Hebrew sold his cow and his plough and bought some baby's clothes. He  went from town to town; when he arrived at the town mentioned, he saw that all the women were buying clothes, excepting Menahera^s mother. And he heard  the women say : Mother of Menahem, come and buy clothes for thy child. Oh, said she, I should like to see the enemies of Israel strangled ^, for on the day of he infantas birth, the Temple of Jerusalem is destroyed. We are certain, answered the traveller, that if, because of his advent, the Temple is destroyed, it will also be rebuilt b\\^ him (therefore, be comforted, and make thy purchases). But, said she, I have not a groat. Never mind, said he, come, buy what thou needest ; if to-day thou hast not the necessary money before thee, I will come to be paid another day. Two days afterwards, he came back into the town. \"What hast thou done with thy child? he asked of the woman. I know not, answered she; since thou wast hero there has been storm and tempest, and my child has been taken from me\". Aboon says : Why all that from a tale concerning the Arab ? A verse of the Bible sanctions it (Isa. x. 33) : \" Behold the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, shall lop the bough with terror ; and the following : ''And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse\" (meaning, that the birth of a Messiah of the line of David shall make up for the destruction of the Temple).",
