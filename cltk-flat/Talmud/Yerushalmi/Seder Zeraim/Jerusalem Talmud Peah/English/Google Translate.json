It was finished, and it was said, \"What is it that you return to the harvest?\" The first crop said: Rabbi Yoseph Nialf, Piat Omarim, from the mouth of Kama. The first is the wig. She has a shiur of laminate, and she has no lesson from the first fruits, and the interview has no lesson, neither for the circumciser nor for the matan, for the tana, the tithe, and the first fruits, and the interview has no lesson. From them Nathan gave back and added a tenth to ten If a man does not finish the wig, it is immeasurable that he should not have passed away, and he must pay the tithes of Rabbi Berkiah in particular, and why do not we produce ashes as a pervert? That he adds to them and that in doing them is a mitzva, even though he adds to them"
