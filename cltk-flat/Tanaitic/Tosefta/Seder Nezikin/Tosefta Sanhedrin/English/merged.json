        "13_Chapter, 0_Tosefta": "A beguiled city has never existed and never will. Rather, it is written about in order to say \"examine and take a reward.\" Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi Elazar says we don't make three beguiled cities in the Land of Israel, but we do make one or two. Rabbi Shimon says we don't even make two,rather only one in Judea and one in the Galilee. Nearby in the book, we don't even make one, in order that gentiles won't disperse and destroy the Land of Israel. The city is permitted if they spend thirty days in the swords and basins, and the city is forbidden. They did not spend thirty days in swords and basins, and the city is permitted to the world to wash them with stoning and bazan, and the city is forbidden to dispose of them. Women, and not small or large people, may be a city that is rejected (Deuteronomy 13:14), the inhabitants of their city after the inhabitants of their city. This is a move. After all this, even converts can be gathered into it, and the freed slaves shall become a city that is rejected by the Talmud, to say (there) the inhabitants of their city after the inhabitants of their city. (Deuteronomy 18: 9), and He gave you mercy and mercy and mercy. If you feel sorry for the great ones, it is already said (Deuteronomy 16: 5): \"Strike if you feel sorry for your death.\" According to the sword, what shall I keep? And I will give you these little riches in which Rabbi Eliezer says, Even great men shall not be killed except according to witnesses, and I will see what I am doing, and give you mercy. And I will love them in their hearts, which means that we have no truth in their hearts, and you do not complain, but rather onenin that there is no selfishness, but in the heart of the assets of the righteous in which the Avdin Rabbi Eliezer says, \"Mochiach says concerning Lot, who was not in Sodom, but because of his possessions. He also went out with his hands on his head as it is stated:\" From Hamlet, you have put enough to save your soul. \"Rabbi Shimon said: Because of what the assets of the righteous in which Ovedine said, because they caused the righteous to live among the wicked, and things are light and warm What if no assets other than heroin and Shumaen not talking about the generation that made righteous wicked Scripture said his fellow staff burn way of life through the die Aac\"o having to fire.

        "7_Chapter, 3_Tosefta": "... should a person/adam be overbearing, they say to him, the mosquito preceded you.\n", 
        "10_Chapter, 1_Tosefta": "...Said Rabbi Akiva: Rabbi Eliezer taught three-hundred laws about magic but I only learnt from him two things: Two collecting gourds—one who collects is exempt, one who collects is liable; one who does the deed is liable, one who does sleight of hand is exempt (see Mishnah Sanhedrin 7:11)...", 
        "6_Chapter, 4_Tosefta": "...Hillel the elder expounded seven hermeneutical principles before the elders of Betheira: kal vachomer, gezeirah shavah, shnei kethuvim, kllal ufrat, kayotze bo bemakom acher (\"the same applies elsewhere\" — i.e., binyan av), davar halamed me'inyano (and davar halamed misofo)."
