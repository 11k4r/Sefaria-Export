Accordingly, she said that also with this, Yissachar did like Barak. For in the valley into which he was dispatched to go down by the word of the Lord through Devorah, they followed at Barak's heels - that is to say, with his going and after him - and were not afraid to go down into the valley. (And the word, dispatched, refers back to Yissachar. Since the word of the Lord that was through Devorah was for the whole nation; but due to [his] honor, she directed the speech to Barak, since he was the general of the army.)",
        "4_Chapter, 14_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>With the divisions of Reuven:</b> That is to say, if all of these tribes did not fear from coming down to war - not in the past, present, nor future - accordingly, with the divisions of Reuven, meaning that which Reuven detached and separated [itself], great decisions of the heart [are called for]. That is to say, behold it is suitable to contemplate many thoughts of the heart to understand this thing - what was with them, such that they did detached [themselves] from the war.",

        "4_Chapter, 16_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>And Dan, etc.:</b> That is to say, also about Dan should we be very angry. For why should he gather all that he has, to place it in his ships, and flee? Is his inheritance not very close to the location of the war? And if so, why did Asher flee and not come to the war, etc.? That is to say, if Asher also did not come here - it did not do so blameworthily, but rather only because his inheritance is on the sea and his cities are open and spread out without a wall.

        "4_Chapter, 17_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>And Naphtali, etc.</b> That is to say, and likewise Naphtali also did not worry about dying upon the open heights of the war's location. (Granted, God commanded taking the Children of Zevulun and the Children of Naphtali to war, as it is written above (Judges 4:6); and He did not command bringing [men] from the other tribes to the war.

And it was as if they fought with him from the heavens, and as if the stars swerved from their paths and from the way of their trajectories and descended and fought with Sisera. But our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Pesachim 118b) that the stars heated up the armor (such that it was too hot to touch). So they went  into the Kishon Rivor to cool [it] down, but the waters of the river washed them away.",

But then the hoofs of the horses were broken from the galloping and the jumping that his mighty men, the riders of the horses, did with them. Or the word, \"<i>abiriv</i> (his strong ones),\" refers back to the horses (and not the riders). So that is to say, [they broke] from the galloping of his strong horses.",
