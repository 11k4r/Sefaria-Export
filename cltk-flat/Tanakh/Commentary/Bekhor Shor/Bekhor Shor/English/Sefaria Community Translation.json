We know that Abraham] spoke of this concept to him from two inferences of what he said to him. The first is a logical inference as he says “My son, God will provide Himself the lamb...” (implying that the son is a substitute for the lamb). [The second proof is that] our Rabbis say (Bereishit Rabbah 56:4) that although Isaac understood, “they went both of them together” - i.e. with equal intentions to fulfil the will of the Creator.", 
        "0_Genesis, 16_Chapter, 10_Verse, 0_Comment": "\"And it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you\". A symbol and a sign that I am the Master and you are my servants, and the sign is sealed in a private place that will not be seen. The reason for this is so that the (non-Jewish) nations of the world won't say that the Jews are blemished (\"ba'alei mumin\"). And since the Holy One, Blessed be He, commanded men and not women, we learn that the place of manhod (\"makom zachrut\") was where God commanded to seal the covenant. And the blood of niddah that women guard, and tell their openings to their husbands, this is to them the blood of the covenant (\"dam brit\")."
