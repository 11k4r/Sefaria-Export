        "1_Genesis, 24_Chapter, 6_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>The years … which he lived.</b> According to the Sages he should have lived another five years but was taken early so that he would not see Eisav’s moral decline.", 
        "1_Genesis, 23_Chapter, 17_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>She quickly lowered her pitcher.</b> Eliezer asked her to tip it for him while it was still on her shoulder to save her the trouble of lowering it. Rivkah, however, was concerned that when he approached to drink it would appear immodest, so she lowered the pitcher.", 
        "1_Genesis, 26_Chapter, 41_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Your brother Eisov is consoled (<i>misnachem</i>).</b> <i>Misnachem</i> can also mean to “glorify oneself” — Eisov boasted of what he would do to Yaakov.", 
        "1_Genesis, 26_Chapter, 16_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>She placed the tasty dish and the bread.</b> Yaakov did not take them on his own because he was not enthusiastic about this subterfuge.", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Chapter, 26_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>Male (<i>zachar</i>) and female (<i>nekeivah</i>).</b> The word <i>zachar</i> derives from the same root as <i>zeicher</i> — “remembrance.” A male descendant inherits his father’s wealth and continues his estate, thereby preserving his memory. <i>Nekeivah</i> comes from a root meaning “distinction” (see <i>Bamidbar</i> 1:17), reflecting the fact that female offspring separate from their ancestral homes.", 
        "1_Genesis, 19_Chapter, 12_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>When Elokim caused me to wander.</b> <i>Elohim</i> here refers to the pagan gods. Thus the verse should actually be rendered, “When the gods of my father’s house caused me to wander” — that is, when he left home to proclaim the true faith throughout the world.", 
        "1_Genesis, 22_Chapter, 1_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>To eulogize … and to weep.</b> In general one weeps over the termination of the life of the deceased before eulogizing the loss to the living. For the righteous, however, death is not a tragedy because they are then able to attain greater heights. Thus it is only the loss to the living that is a cause for weeping.", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Chapter, 6_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>A living soul.</b> This alludes to the unique human capacity for free choice. The word <i>nefesh</i> — “soul” — indicates desire, as in <i>Devarim</i> 21:14. The implication is that only human beings were created to exercise their free will.", 
        "1_Genesis, 32_Chapter, 9_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>Like seeing the face.</b> You have received me as if I were a great dignitary; allow me, then, to reciprocate by accepting my gift.", 
        "1_Genesis, 30_Chapter, 43_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Come let us make a pact.</b> Lavan wanted to give the impression that Yaakov was the offending party and that the pact was needed so that he would refrain from harming him.", 
        "1_Genesis, 11_Chapter, 12_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Please say that you are my sister.</b> That is, resolve in your heart that we are no longer married. Before the Torah was given this was sufficient to effect a divorce, hence he was not asking her to lie. Although Avraham observed the entire Torah, in this case he conducted himself according to Noachide law to save his life.", 
        "1_Genesis, 3_Chapter, 1_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>A shepherd.</b> A profession that neither preoccupies the mind nor wearies the body, thus it is ideal for those who wish to engage in contemplation. In fact, some say that Hevel was punished for going too far in his metaphysical speculations.", 
        "1_Genesis, 24_Chapter, 33_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>Eisov scorned the birthright.</b> Even after the sale he did not consider the birthright to be worth the money he received for it. Therefore it is not correct to say that he was cheated.\n", 
        "1_Genesis, 49_Chapter, 13_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Yoseif … and all those.</b> On the way to the burial the mourners are mentioned last (v. 8), whereas on the way back they are mentioned first. This is still the custom — on the way to the cemetery the mourners follow the others and on the way back they precede them.", 
        "1_Genesis, 1_Chapter, 6_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>The breath (or “soul”) of life.</b> <i>Chayim</i> — “life” — is in the plural to indicate that the soul possesses numerous faculties, such as growth, sensation and intellect. Alternatively, it indicates that the soul lives forever. ", 
        "1_Genesis, 32_Chapter, 11_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>I will move on with you.</b> Alternatively, “I will go along to exchange stories with you”.", 
        "1_Genesis, 32_Chapter, 9_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Because I have seen your face.</b> That is, I have merited to be reunited with you in such a manner.  ", 
        "1_Genesis, 0_Chapter, 0_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>Elohim.</b> According to Rashi this Name signifies lordship and greatness; according to the Rambam, judgment; according to the Ibn Ezra, kingship; according to the Seforno, eternality. It is in the plural, says the Seforno, to indicate that He is the ultimate eternal form from which all others derive. According to the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i>) and the <i>Beis Yosef</i> it signifies strength and domination. To the Ralbag it indicates that all things emanate from and are governed by Him. The Vilna Gaon agrees that it indicates governance, which is why it can be applied to lesser governing beings as well.", 
        "1_Genesis, 47_Chapter, 15_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Let my name be called.</b> They too would be called “Hebrews” (<i>ivrim</i>) — indicating their origin “across the [Euphrates] river” (<i>eiver hanahar</i>) — despite having been born in Egypt. Alternatively, their lineage would be traced to the Patriarchs despite their mother’s descent from Shechem; see 41:45 in the name of <i>Tosafos</i>."
