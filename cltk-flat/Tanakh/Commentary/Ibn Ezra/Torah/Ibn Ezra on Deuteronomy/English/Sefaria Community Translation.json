        "13_Chapter, 0_Verse, 2_Comment": "And the reason is \"[Ye are the] children\": Since you know that your are children to God, and that he loves you more than the love of a father for his son; \"ye shall not cut yourselves\" over anything God does for you, since it is all for the good even if you don't understand - just as young children don't understand the actions of their parents yet still assent to them, so should you do; \"for thou art a holy people\" and you are not like the other nations, so don't do as they do. [...]", 
        "11_Chapter, 4_Verse, 1_Comment": "... This refers to the land, and the meaning is 'the place where His honor rests.'", 
        "21_Chapter, 0_Verse, 0_Comment": "\"Thou shalt not see [thy brotherâ€™s] ox\" - even when you are going out to war. (This is a homiletic interpretation.)",

        "19_Chapter, 18_Verse, 0_Comment": "I have already explained in Sefer HaYesod that it is possible to abbreviate words in any language e.g. donkey to donk'. Only the word \"no\" cannot be abbreviated because it will reverse the meaning. A great Spanish grammarian said [in this vein] that a \"heh\" is missing [here] and it should be \"for is a man like a tree of the field\" [as a rhetorical question.] (Note that a number of English translations actually render the phrase this way --Translator), but I do not find the notion compelling since what reason is there to say \"Do not destroy a fruit tree for it is not like a person to who can run away from you\" and according to my understanding we have no need for all this. [Rather] this is the explanation: \"for you shall eat from it but not cut it down for a man is as a tree of the field\" and similarly \"for he seizes a soul\" i.e. (in the case of seizing tools necessary for living as collateral, which is the verse cited --Translator) he is seizing things which preserve life. \"and do not cut it down\" [in our verse] is parsed along with \"to go before you in a seige,\" that is to say \"do not destroy a fruit tree, which provides life for people; it is only permitted for you to eat from it and not to cut it down to force the city into siege.\" Evidence that this is correct [comes from the phrase] \"thou shalt cut it down and build a siege [tower]\" [regarding non-fruit bearing trees]", 
        "11_Chapter, 3_Verse, 0_Comment": "The meaning is that you shall not offer [Korbanot] on the high places and mountains [referenced in the previous verse], rather, just in the place where He will place His name.",
