        "1_Bereshit, 43_Chapter, 11_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>The goblet was found.</b> Believing him guilty the brothers shamed and struck him between his shoulders, likening him to his mother who stole her father’s idols (31:19). In recompense the Holy Temple was constructed in his portion — “between his shoulders”. <b>They tore their garments.</b> This was in recompense for causing their father to tear his (37:34). Binyamin tore his garments because they suspected him. In recompense his descendant Mordechai, who also tore his garments (<i>Ester</i> 4:1), merited a golden crown (<i>Ester</i> 8:15).", 
        "1_Bereshit, 25_Chapter, 26_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Between us.</b> Let the oath to refrain from harming one another be kept secret between us — Avimelech did not want his people to know that he was afraid of a lone individual.",

        "1_Bereshit, 34_Chapter, 1_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Get rid of the foreign gods.</b> These were the silver and gold idols they took from Shechem.

        "1_Bereshit, 33_Chapter, 24_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>Each (literally, “each <i>man</i>”) took his sword.</b> Yaakov worked seven years for Leah; then Reuvein, Shimon and Leivi were born in successive seven month pregnancies.

        "1_Bereshit, 44_Chapter, 0_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>Let everyone leave.</b> By doing this Yoseif placed himself in grave danger because if the brothers chose to kill him there would be no one to save him. Nevertheless, he preferred the prospect of death to shaming them before others.", 
        "1_Bereshit, 21_Chapter, 6_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>Elokim will show … my son.</b> It was a much easier trial for Yitzchok to give up his life than for Avraham to slaughter his son.", 
        "1_Bereshit, 49_Chapter, 20_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>He comforted them.</b> Although he comforted them we do not find that he forgave them. And since they died without forgiveness, the deaths of the Ten Martyrs (Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues) were required to atone for their sin.", 
        "1_Bereshit, 0_Chapter, 11_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>The earth brought forth.</b> Scripture does not attribute the creation of plants directly to Hashem because the vegetative soul, unlike the animate soul, is too lowly to be associated with His Name.", 
        "1_Bereshit, 29_Chapter, 37_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>Yaakov took.</b> Yaakov relates in 31:10 that he was shown in a dream that angels were manipulating the sheep. It was actually only then that he began placing the rods before them to conceal the miracle with a naturalistic stratagem.", 
        "1_Bereshit, 27_Chapter, 13_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>As the dust of the earth.</b> Other than indicating fruitfulness, the metaphor of the dust also indicated that his offspring would be trampled like the dust and that like the dust they would eventually rise above those who trampled them.", 
        "1_Bereshit, 5_Chapter, 13_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>Make for yourself.</b> Noach did not pray for his generation upon hearing the evil decree as other saintly figures did under similar circumstances because he knew that Hashem would not spare them if there were not at least ten righteous individuals among them — corresponding to the ten statements with which the world was created — and he and his family were only eight\n", 
        "1_Bereshit, 17_Chapter, 19_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>The wailing concerning Sedom.</b> Despite their other sins, their fate was sealed because they allowed the poor to die of hunger.

        "1_Bereshit, 0_Chapter, 3_Verse, 4_Comment": "<b>The second day.</b> Increase is the first step towards differentiation, as is reflected in the fact that <i>sheini</i> — “second” — derives from the root שנה  meaning “change.” Thus the creation of a second day set the stage for disharmony in the world. For this reason the <i>Midrash</i> teaches that both strife and <i>Gehinnom</i> were created on the second day (<i>Rabbeinu Bechaye</i>).",

        "1_Bereshit, 16_Chapter, 12_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>This shall be My covenant.</b> Circumcision is akin to a sacrifice. Just as the blood of a sacrifice atones, so does the blood of circumcision. Just as an animal may not be sacrificed until it is eight days old, so is circumcision performed only on the eighth day. Just as it is a mitzvah to eat of a sacrifice, so is circumcision accompanied by a festive meal. Moreover, circumcision is even greater than a sacrifice because the latter is performed with one’s property whereas the former is performed with a central limb of the body.",
