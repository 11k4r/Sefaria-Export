Zion, which is shamem,\" and in the category of doubles [a three-letter root with the second and third letters the same], and it means that He raised His voice to make a great noise in the war to the extent of destroying them.  And if the meaning of the final mem were like \"otam\" [\"them\"] [i.e., a pronominal object suffix], it should have written \"v'hamamam.\"  However, from the root heh-mem-heh, [the basis of] \"yehemeh libi\" (Jer. 48:36 [reversed]), one could say \"v'hamam,\" [i.e.,] \"v'hamah otam,\" as from \"asah\" [he made], [we derive] \"otz'bi asam\" (Isa. 48:5 -- \"my idol made them\"), and from \"When Ya'akov saw [ra'ah]\" (Gen. 29:10) [we derive] \"And Ya'kov said when he saw them (ra'am)\" (Gen. 32:3) -- \"ra'ah otam.\"  And \"hamam\" from the root h-m-h would be explained \"hamah otam.\"  And if you say that this [the actual word in our verse] should also be interpreted as \"hamah otam,\" you can't say that, because the word himyon [making a loud noise] is intransitive:  \"My mind yehemeh like a harp\" (Jer. 48:36, modified) -- of its own.  If the action was done to something else [i.e., if it were a transitive verb], one would have to make it a stronger conjugation [a pi'el]: v'himem.

[Another example:] \"yishneh [debased, changed] is the finest gold\" (Lam. 4:1) -- by itself, thus the soft conjugation [a kal]; but [done] to others it would say \"v'shinah [changed] his prison garments\" (II Kings 25:29) or \"vay'shaneha [he treated her differently] and her maids\" (Esth. 2:9).",
