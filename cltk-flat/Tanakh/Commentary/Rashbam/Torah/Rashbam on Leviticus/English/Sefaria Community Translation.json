As it wrote above at the end of the book [Exodus], Moshe could not enter the Tent of Meeting, etc.  Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, called him from within the Tent of Meeting.  So this is Scripture means:  \"He called to Moshe from the Tent of Meeting, and He spoke to him, saying.\"  \"From the Tent\" refers back to \"He called,\" as in (Ex. 19:3), \"And Adonai called to him from the mountain, saying.\"  And he heard the voice speaking from the Tent of Meeting (see Num. 7:89) -- from the Tent of Meeting he heard the voice.  \"God called to him from out of the bush, saying\" (Ex. 3:4).  The duplicative expression \"He spoke\" (Lev. 1:1), as I explained in Parashat Noah, is, just as it says (Num. 8:2), \"Speak to Aharon and say,\" so it says \"He spoke to Moshe, saying\" (Lev. 1:1) -- [saying] to Moshe."
