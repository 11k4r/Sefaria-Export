Likewise, the angel asks, \"Why did you hit your ass three times?

And the Holy One's, blessed be He, statement to him (v.8), \"speak to the rock,\" he thought that this \"speaking\" to the rock that was mentioned was with the staff, and so he hit the rock twice, as with anger and rage, and out of doubt:  if it produces water, good, and if not, I will speak to the rock afterwards.  And the Holy One, blessed be He, ratified [what] Moshe [said, for the water] to go out through his striking, and even so, he was punished, because the Holy One, blessed be He, is exacting with the righteous ones, and this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said (v.12): \"because you did not trust Me enough to sanctify Me\" -- through their speaking to the rock.  For He is exacting with the righteous ones, even by as much as a hair's breadth.
