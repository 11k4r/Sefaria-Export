Another explanation: The ox recognizes its master and is fearful of him; it does not change what I have decreed upon it, saying, \"I will not plow today.\" And the donkey does not say to its master, \"I will not carry loads today.\" These animals, which were created to serve you, and do not receive reward if they behave appropriately, nor are they punished if they sin, do not change their ways which I decreed upon them.

He prophesied \"the prophecy of Bavel\" and \"the prophecy of Moav.\" We learn from here that this is not the [chronological] beginning of the book, and the book is not named after this vision. We see in a baraisa in Mechilta that the book (Isaiah's story) begins in the year King Uziah died, but the events are not presented in chronological order. Proof can be found in the words of the sefer: On the tumultuous day on which Uziah became leprous, it says, \"And I heard the Voice of G-d saying, 'Whom will I send, and who will go for us?' And I said, 'Here I am, send me.'\" We learn that this was the beginning of this mission, and the prophecy in this chapter was said later on. When it says, \"That he prophesied on Judah and Jerusalem,\" it refers specifically to this prophecy. Just as later it says, for each nation's prophecy, \"the prophecy of such-and-such nation,\" here it says that he saw this vision regarding Judah and Jerusalem. [This verse should not be regarded as a general introduction to Isaiah and his prophecies, but rather as a specific introduction to this particular prophecy.] Because this vision comprises harsh words of reproof it is called a \"chazon,\" which is the harshest of the ten terms for prophecy, as it says in Beraishis Rabba. Proof of this can be found in the words \"Harsh visions were told to me.\"",

But the chachamim disagreed with them and said that the true explanation is otherwise: when witnesses come and testify, and their testimonies match, the testimonies are valid, but if the testimonies do not match they are not valid. If Isaiah had not come and given [the language of] \"hearing\" to the heavens and \"listening\" to the earth, the heavens would have testified that when they were called on to witness in the days of Moshe, who said \"I have called on you to witness today,\" they were called to perform \"listening.\" But the earth would have testified, \"I was called to perform 'hearing,'\" and their testimonies would not have matched.
