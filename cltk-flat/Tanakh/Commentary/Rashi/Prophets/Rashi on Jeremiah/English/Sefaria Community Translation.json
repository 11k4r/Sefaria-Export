Moshe rebuked B'nei Yisrael close to his death while he was already revered in their eyes, with the many miracles that he did for them: took them out of Egypt, split the sea for them, brought down the Manna, brought them the slav (some say this is a quail), gave them the Torah, and brought up the well. And here, I am going to rebuke them at the beginning of my mission?!",

None of them were able to appease G-d. Rachel came and said \"Do I have more compassion than you, Hashem? Does a person have more compassion than Hashem? Yaakov worked for me for many years and at the end my sister went under the Chuppah and married my husband. And I remained quiet. Do I have more compassion that You?\" Hashem said to Rachel, \"It is right what you say and because of you and the signs you gave your sister, I will return Am Yisroel to the Holy Land.\""
