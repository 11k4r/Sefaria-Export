        "0_Chapter, 0_Verse, 0_Comment": "Zechariah's prophecy is very obscure, filled with dreamlike  visions meant for interpretation, but we can't establish a reliable one until the 'just teacher'.  I will attempt to thoughtfully give the texts appropriate interpretations, in step with Yonatan's interpretations.",
        "8_Chapter, 12_Verse, 0_Comment": "For I bend Judah for Me – in the end, Antiochus will take the kingship from the hands of the kings of Persia and do evil to you. Then I will draw out Yehudah to be like my war bow and they will fight Antiochus in days of the Hasmoneans:",

        "8_Chapter, 12_Verse, 2_Comment": "And I will arouse your children, O Zion – upon the armies of Antiochus",

This is the spring of which Yoel prophesied, and the spring which comes out from the house of the Lord is the stream of which Ezekiel prophesied “…and he measure a thousand and brought me through water…”"
