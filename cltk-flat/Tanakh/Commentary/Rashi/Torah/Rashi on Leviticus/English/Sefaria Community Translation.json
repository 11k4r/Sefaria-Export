        "25_Chapter, 14_Verse, 4_Comment": "Apostasy. So these are 7 sins,  the first leads to the next and so on till the 7th. They are as follows; not to study, not to perform, abhorring others who do the commandments, despising the scholars, preventing others from their performance, denying the commandments, and apostasy", 
        "24_Chapter, 54_Verse, 0_Comment": "Because to Me the Children of Israel are servants - My deed [of ownership] comes first.",

        "23_Chapter, 19_Verse, 0_Comment": "\"So shall it be inflicted on him\" - Our Rabbis explained that it does not mean actually inflicting a wound but instead refers to monetary compensation…that is why \"inflict\" is based on the language of \"giving\" (yinaten), meaning a thing that was given from hand to hand.", 
        "1_Chapter, 0_Verse, 3_Comment": "Upon the entire surface of it.", 
        "13_Chapter, 33_Verse, 0_Comment": "ונתתי נגע צרעת [WHEN YOU COME TO THE LAND …]I WILL PUT THE PLAGUE OF THE LEPROSY — This was an announcement to them that these plagues would come upon them (Sifra, Metzora, Section 5 4; Horayot 10a), because the Amorites concealed treasures of gold in the walls of their houses during the whole 40 years the Israelites were in the wilderness in order that these might not possess them when they conquered Israel, and in consequence of the plague they would pull down the house and discover them (Leviticus Rabbah 17:6).", 
        "15_Chapter, 1_Verse, 0_Comment": "So he will not die, the way his sons did.",

        "18_Chapter, 17_Verse, 0_Comment": "Do not hold a grudge: One asks: \"Can I borrow your Ax?\" and he replies: \"No\"...The next day the other asks him: \"Can I borrow your ax\"? And he says: \"I will not lend it to you just as you did not lend me yours\", this is revenge. What is a grudge?  One asks: \"Can I borrow your Ax?\" and he replies: \"No\"...The next day the other asks him: \"Can I borrow your ax\"? And he says: \"Here you go, I am not like you who did not lend it to me\", this is a grudge, that he guarded hatred in his heart even though he was not going to take revenge.",

        "1_Chapter, 0_Verse, 2_Comment": "Flour must come from wheat, as it is stated \"wheat-flour\". And now Mincha offering is of less than a tenth, as it is stated, \"a tenth of a flour-mincha offering\" - a tenth for each mincha-offering.", 
        "22_Chapter, 15_Verse, 3_Comment": "A NEW MEAL OFFERING — It was the first meal-offering that was brought from the new crop. And if you say, “But surely the meal-offering of the Omer has already been offered on the 16th of Nisan”?! It [the Omer] was not like all the other meal-offerings [which, with one exception (cf. Numbers 5:15), were all brought of wheat] since it was brought of barley [and therefore it is not taken into account here] (cf. Menachot 84b).", 
        "16_Chapter, 2_Verse, 1_Comment": "2 In the Camp: Outside of the Courtyard.", 
        "18_Chapter, 15_Verse, 0_Comment": "You shall not go about as a talebearer: I say that, since all those who start quarrels and speak lashon hara go into homes to seek what evil they can see, or what evil things to tell in the marketplace, they are called הולכי רכיל, [the same as] הולכי רגילה, - “those who go about spying”. A proof for my words is that we do not find the term רכילות without being expressed as הליכה , “going”; as לֹא תֵלֵךְ רָכִיל, “You shall not go about as a talebearer,” and, “going tale bearing (הוֹלְכֵי רָכִיל) (Jer. 6:28); [like] copper and iron.” (TBC)", 
        "24_Chapter, 3_Verse, 0_Comment": "\"Shall be...for the land\" - For the fields and for the vineyards...", 
        "1_Chapter, 0_Verse, 0_Comment": "The term \"soul\" (\"nefesh\") is not used for any of the sacrifices other than the mincha, for who was most likely to volunteer a mincha? A poor person.  Thus God says, [whomever offers to me a mincha] I will treat as if they have offered to me their soul (\"nefesh\").",

        "24_Chapter, 54_Verse, 1_Comment": "I am GOD your GOD - All who makes them subservient below are as if they made them subservient above.", 
        "24_Chapter, 0_Verse, 0_Comment": "At Mount Sinai.  Why is the matter of shmittah (Sabbatical year) found at Mount Sinai?  Weren't all of the commandments spoken from Sinai? How  is this the case with shmittah? It is spoken of in generalities and specifics and its details from Sinai. Even so all of them (the commandments) are spoken of in their generalities and details from Sinai, thus it is taught in Torat Kohamin (Leviticus).  And it appears to me that  that thus is its explanation: since we do not find the Sabbatical year for the soil that was taught on the plains of Moab in the book of Deuteronomy.  That is to teach us that all of its details and its specifics were spoken at Sinai.  And Scripture comes and teaches here on every speech that was attributed to Moses, that from Sinai was it given, all of their generalities and their details, and that they were repeated again on the plains of Moab.                       ", 
        "23_Chapter, 21_Verse, 0_Comment": "For I the Lord am your God - the God of all of you; just as I attach my name specially to you [the people Israel] so too do I attach my name specially to strangers.", 
        "9_Chapter, 1_Verse, 0_Comment": "Rabbi Eliezer said, the sons of Aaron died because they rendered a halachic decision in the presence of Moshe their teacher. Rabbi Yishmael said they entered the Temple while intoxicated, and the proof is that after their death the Torah warns against performing the service in the Temple while drunk.", 
        "1_Chapter, 0_Verse, 1_Comment": "One who declares, \"I obligate myself in a mincha offering,\" must bring a mincha of fine flour, for this is considered the primary mincha offering and the kamitza is taken while it is still flour. This is as it is explained, for it is stated here about five types of mincha-offerings, and all are brought baked - prior to the kamitza - except for this one, and thus it is called the mincha of flour.", 
        "18_Chapter, 1_Verse, 1_Comment": "2. Kedoshim tehyu. Be separated from the inappropriate sexual relationships and from sin. Because every time you find a precaution around erva you find holiness. \"Stay away from a prostitute and other disqualified women...I am God your sanctifier \"(Leviticus 21:7); \"And he will not profane his seed, I am God his sanctifier\" (Leviticus 21:15); \"Be holy, do not take a prostitute woman or disqualified woman, etc. (Leviticus 21:6,7).", 
        "9_Chapter, 0_Verse, 0_Comment": "And fire went forth: Rabbi Eliezer says: Aaron’s sons died only because they rendered halachic decisions in the presence of Moses, their teacher. Rabbi Ishmael says: [They died because] they had entered the sanctuary after having drunk wine. The proof is that after their death, [Scripture] admonished the survivors that they may not enter the sanctuary after having drunk wine. This is analogous to a king who had a faithful attendant. [When he found him standing at tavern entrances, he severed his head in silence and appointed another attendant in his place. We would not know why he put the first to death, but for his enjoining the second thus, “You must not enter the doorway of taverns,” from which we know that for such a reason he had put the first one to death. Thus [it is said], “And fire went forth from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.” But we would not know why they [Nadab and Abihu] died, but for His commanding Aaron, “Do not drink wine that will lead to intoxication.” We know from this that they died precisely on account of the wine. For this reason Scripture showed love to Aaron by directing the divine utterance to him alone, thus, “Do not drink wine that will lead to intoxication,”] as recounted in Vayikra Rabbah (12:1).", 
        "18_Chapter, 15_Verse, 1_Comment": "Don't stand idly by the blood of your neighbor: To see his death and you are able to save him, such as one drowning in a river, or an animal or bandits are advancing on him"
