And [the Sages,] may their memory be blessed, said that one who prays for the sake of his fellow is first answered himself. And so it was that since Avraham prayed for Avimelekh, the Lord took account of Sarah his wife. And the expression, taking account (<i>pekidah</i>) is truthfully, visiting and paying attention, as in \"I have surely taken account of (<i>pekod pakadati</i>) you and that which is being done to you in Egypt\" (Exodus 3:16). For it is since they thought that He, may He be blessed, was not paying attention to them that He said this. And this is like, \"and Shimshon took account of his wife with goat clothing\" (Judges 15:1); \"Lord, in distress did they take account of You.\" Until on account of this did [people] call those counted, <i>pekudim</i>, and those counting them, <i>pokedim</i>. And the explanation of this verse is that the angel of God had said in God's name, \"I will surely return to you next year\" (Genesis 18:10). And the content of this returning and this coming is the benefit that He will give him a son from Sarah. For the action indicates the presence of the actor; and since the action was here, the Actor was [also] here. And that is why it is stated (Joshua 6:27), \"And the Lord was with Yehoshua\"; \"And the Lord was with Yosef\" (Genesis 39:2) - in that His goodness and His attention was with him. And that is the meaning of, \"And the Lord took account of Sarah\" - that He payed attention to her matter and that which He had forecast for her. But since there is a taking account for the good and a taking account for the bad - as He stated (Exodus 32:24), \"but on the day of My taking account, I will take account\" - it was necessary to explain here that the taking account of Sarah was when \"the Lord did to her like He had spoken,\" when He gave her the son that He had forecast to her. And He did not mention that He took account of Avraham for [the following reason]: Because the retention and the pregnancy is with the woman; also because the thing was stranger and more difficult from the perspective of Sarah than it was from the perspective of Avraham. And it is [also] possible to explain, \"And the Lord took account of Sarah as He had said,\" by giving her seed, \"and the Lord did to Sarah as He had spoken\" - that He gave her a male child, and not a daughter. And his name was called Yitzchak, because that is what He said to her. However, from the perspective of Avraham, it said, \"And Sarah conceived and bore Avraham a son in his old age\" - meaning to say that she gave birth to the son mentioned from him even with all of his age. And that is the reason for its stating, \"in his old age.\" As it did not say it to denote the time at which she gave birth, but rather to say that also this kindness and this taking account - from the perspective of his being elderly - was done for him. And it is also possible that this is to say that Yitzchak would be the child of his old age, and that is a child that helps his father and serves him; so he would need him for his old age. And with this explanation, it is indicated that its stating, \"At the set-time of which God had spoken\" - that this is the mention of the time at which he was born; not that which it says, \"in his old age.\" And two questions are solved with this, the first and the second. ",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 20_Chapter, 0_Verse, 12_Paragraph": "And Scripture recounted with this that Avraham did two things: The first is that he called the name of his son that was born to him, Yitzchak. And note its saying, \"that was born to him, to which Sarah had borne to him, Yitzchak\" - as behold two messages come to inform us that he called his name Yitzchak, from two perspectives: Whether from the perspective of his being elderly, such that he would laugh and rejoice with him - and about this, it stated, \"that was born to him.\" Or whether from the perspective of Sarah, for her being elderly - and about that, it stated, \"to which Sarah had borne to him.\" And if we don't explain it like this, there would be great superfluity in this verse. As there is no doubt that it would be appropriate that it [otherwise] only say, \"And he called his name Yitzchak.\" And the second thing that he did is that Avraham circumcised his son, Yitzchak. And its saying, \"eight days old,\" appears to me to refer to both things together - to the calling of the name and to his entering the covenant (his circumcision). As he did both of these things when the child was eight days old. And it gave the reason for all of this by saying, \"like that which (<i>keasher</i>) God had commanded him.\" For behold, the <i>kaf</i> used for comparison in the word, <i>keasher</i>, is not coming to make known how he did this, but rather that he did it because God commanded him. And it stated this to say that even with Yitzchak being very beloved to his father, since he did not come to him according to the natural fashion - such that because of this, it would have been appropriate for him to be afraid to give him over to the danger of circumcision, given that he was tender and the only one to his mother - behold that Avraham did not consider this to be anything in comparison to the fulfillment of God's commandment that He commanded him regarding the calling of his name and the commandment of circumcision. And that is the meaning of its saying, \"like that which (<i>keasher</i>) God had commanded him.\" And the Ramban wrote that he called his name Yitzchak on the day he was born, since he was commanded about it and the time of the commandment came with his birth, whereas the time of the circumcision was eight days; and that is what he did.

And in these verse, it always has the word, \"his son,\" adjacent to \"Yitzchak,\" to teach that he was the main son in his eyes, not Yishmael, as will be explained. But it is also possible to explain that this verse is coming as an introduction to recount the praise of Sarah and her comprehension: For even though Avraham called the name of his son Yitzchak from his own perspective and the perspective of his wife, as I explained, and that Avraham was a hundred years old when Yitzchak was born for him, such that it was very strange concerning him that she gave birth - behold she did not relate this strangeness to Avraham at all, but rather [only] to herself, in saying, \"God has made laughter for me, all who hear of it will laugh for me.\" Meaning to say, that there was no laughter from his perspective but only from her perspective. And it is possible that it repeats, \"all who hear of it will laugh for me,\" to say that they will laugh about me - because she laughed at the announcement of the angel. And with this, the fourth and fifth questions are solved.   ",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 20_Chapter, 0_Verse, 14_Paragraph": "However, for me, the matter of it stating, \"Who declared to Avraham,\" is that when Sarah saw that besides the birth, God also acted magnificently to do kindness with her in that which He gave her milk in her breasts to nurse her son - as this is not frequently found in nature that old women are sufficiently supplied with blood that is suitable for the fetus and that this blood should come to the breasts, such that nourishment be formed from it for the newborn - hence when they saw that she did not have withered breasts but full breasts to nurse him, she said this other statement, \"Who declared to Avraham that Sarah would nurse children.\" Meaning to say, behold the Holy One, blessed be He, announced the birth to Avraham, but He did not say [anything about] the nursing and He did not inform them [of it]. That is the meaning of, \"Who declared to Avraham\" - as neither God, nor an angel nor anyone in the world told Avraham that it would be possible for Sarah to nurse children now that she gave birth to a son in his old age. And there is no doubt that God, may He be blessed, did this kindness for the honor of Yitzchak, such that he not nurse from the breasts of foreign women, daughters of Canaan. Alternatively, its explanation could be that I know \"Who declared to Avraham that Sarah would nurse children\" - given that He declared to him that I would give birth to a son in his old age. And to mark this miracle, Scripture stated, \"The child grew and was weaned\" - meaning to say, that [even] with Sarah's milk being thin and little, in the way of old women, behold the child grew and was weaned. For her milk did not stop until she weaned him. And because of that great miracle, Avraham made a banquet on the day of Yitzchak's weaning, to give thanks to his God for this miracle. And that is why he did not make a banquet for the birth or for the circumcision - since he was already informed about it - but he rather [made it] for the weaning and the growth and the nursing which was not told to him. And with this, the sixth and seventh questions have been solved. And the Ran wrote that Avraham did not make a banquet until the day that [Yitzchak] was weaned because an infant continues to face dangers while he is nursing from his mother's breasts. But that which I wrote myself is more correct.",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 20_Chapter, 8_Verse, 0_Paragraph": "<b>And Sarah saw [until] And it was at that time (Genesis 21:9-22)</b> Scripture mentioned that Sarah saw Yishmael laugh and that it was bad in her eyes. Maybe he was laughing because of the banquet that they were making on the day that Yitzchak was weaned. So that [would be] the connection of the verses and that is why no section [break] came between them; and [the reason] that Sarah said that since the son of the maidservant would not inherit with her son, what is the need for him to dwell in her home, mocking her good deeds? It would be better for Avraham to drive him out from his home and that he go to grow up in a different land. But since he was a youth, she said that his mother should go with him. Not to drive her out personally or for a sin that she had sinned, but rather that she go with her son to guide him in what he should do. And this explanation is according to the commentators. However what is correct in my eyes is that when Yitzchak was nursing from his mother's breasts [and he was] in borderline neonatal danger, Sarah did not request that he drive out the maidservant and her son. As there is no doubt that Avraham would have difficulty abandoning his definite son, Yishmael - a grown man of full stature - for the question mark that Yitzchak was while he was nursing from curdled milk. But after Yitzchak grew in his years and in his stature and was like everyone [else], it was appropriate for Avraham to grab hold of him as the son who would inherit him; to abandon the shell and cling to the fruit. And because of this, when Sarah saw that the son of Hagar - meaning the son of the maidservant, since that is why it did not call him the son of Avraham, but rather the son of Hagar, to his disgrace - playing at home like an only son in the home that he will inherit, like he was before the birth of Yitzchak; that he was very beloved in the eyes of his father; and that all the members of the household would serve him and gladden him as it was when she adopted him, she was concerned about this. For she thought that it would be fitting that Yitzchak should laugh and that Yishmael should serve him. But since Yishmael was already established in the home for many years and she could not remove him from his established position, it was right in her eyes that he should not continue to dwell in the home. And behold she insisted on this, since Hagar had given birth to him for Avraham, so it was possible that Yishmael would in the end say that he was also the son of Avraham and that it was fitting that both of them would be equal in the inheritance. For the property was Avraham's and, from his perspective, both of them were sons and equal. And that is the reason for its saying, \"whom she had borne to Avraham, laughing.\" Since from that perspective - that Hagar had borne him to Avraham - there was a doubt about the inheritance.   ",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 20_Chapter, 8_Verse, 1_Paragraph": "And the Ramban (Ramban on Genesis 21:10) wrote that the expulsion of Hagar was not intended for itself. And the testimony is [Sarah saying], \"for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit.\" However it mentioned Hagar in the expulsion, because the youth could not leave his mother - 'if he left his mother, he would die.' But it appears that the matter is not like this. Since Sarah intended to drive out Hagar as well from the home, just as she intended to drive out Yishmael. And that was because if Hagar was Avraham's concubine, it was not appropriate that she should sit in his home with his wife, the lady [of the house], but rather that she should dwell alone in a different house and the man should go to her secretly. And so if she always dwells in the house and dies there, or if Avraham dies in her lifetime, behold she is assumed to be a full-fledged wife and her sons inherit his properties. And because of this, Sarah said, \"Drive out this maidservant and her son, for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit with my son, with Yitzchak.\" She meant to say, it is not appropriate that the son of the maidservant, the concubine, inherit like the son of the wife, the lady, equally. And if it was like the words of the Ramban, it would have been fitting for her to say, \"Drive out the son of this maidservant and his mother.\" In truth, however, the more intended expulsion at that time was the expulsion of the maidservant. And its saying, \"for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit,\" is the reason for the expulsion of the maidservant, and that is from the reason I mentioned: That a woman who gives birth for a man and she is with him in the home in which he establishes his residence is assumed to be his full-fledged wife, and her sons also inherit the properties of the husband at his death. But a maidservant, who is a concubine, does not dwell in his home and her sons only inherit what their father wants to give them as presents while he is still alive. And that is what Avraham did, as it is stated (Genesis 25:6), \"To the sons of the concubines that Avraham had, Avraham gave gifts, and he sent them away, etc.\" And for me, there is no doubt that Yishmael was included among them, that he gave gifts also to him in his lifetime. And that is why it states, concubines in the plural, as they were Hagar and Keturah, since they were [his] wives. Whereas Yishmael returned to his home and he was at [Avraham's] burial. If so, behold that the expulsion of the maidservant was more necessary; and if he had expelled the son, and the mother would have stayed at home, why would this take away from the assumption of the son? As they will nevertheless say that his mother was a full-fledged wife to his father, and the proof is her always residing at home. But the son's leaving from there is not a proof, since the sons of the lady also leave the home of their father many times and go to the far places of the earth. And behold, Sarah was not insistent about this until now because she thought she would not give birth; so it [had been] her desire and will that Yishmael should inherit all of the house. And that is why she wanted Hagar and Yishmael, her son, to dwell in her home. But after Yitzchak's birth, she was concerned about what could possibly be after Avraham's death concerning the inheritance of his properties. And that is why Sarah, with her great comprehension, said, \"Drive out this maidservant and her son, for the son of this maidservant shall not inherit with my son, with Yitzchak\" - meaning to say, \"with my son,\" since I am the lady and she is my maidservant; and \"with Yitzchak,\" because of his own perfection and virtue and his fineness in replacing Yishmael. ",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 20_Chapter, 8_Verse, 2_Paragraph": "And Scripture mentions that, \"This thing was very bad in the eyes of Avraham, on account of his son.\" And through this, it reveals that the expulsion of the maidservant was also bad in his eyes, even if it was only very bad in his eyes on account of his son, from the perspective that he was his son - 'like the pity of a father for his children.' However God, may He be blessed, examines the inner chambers and the heart, such that he saw that Sarah's question and request was proper and appropriate. [So] He said to Avraham, \"Do not let it be bad in your eyes concerning the youth and concerning your maidservant.\" Because he was saddened about both of them - first and essentially about the youth, and secondarily about the maidservant - He had to console him about both of them. And He mentioned the youth first since he is the main [concern]. And about the matter of the maidservant, He said to him, \"all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice\" - meaning to say, Hagar is the maidservant of Sarah; and so if she wants to drive her out, listen to her voice. But about the matter of the youth, He said to him, \"for it is through Yitzchak that your seed will be called\" - so he is the true son, not Yishmael. And the Ralbag wrote that the cause of expelling Yishmael was from God, may He be blessed - so as to separate him from Yitzchak, in order that Yitzchak not learn from his bad deeds. But He informed him that He would would also make the son of the maidservant a great nation - meaning to say, [even] with his being the son of an Egyptian maidservant, behold the eyes of His providence will be upon him for [Avraham]'s sake and in his merit. And he will grow and be very very numerous. And He said this to him so that his going away not be bad to [Avraham], since wherever he goes, God [will be] with him. So behold these verses have been explained and the ninth and tenth questions have been solved. ",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 20_Chapter, 8_Verse, 3_Paragraph": "And Scripture recounted Avraham's perfection - that he did not challenge the utterance of his Maker, but got up early in the morning to send them away. He also did not give them silver and gold - such that he thought that this would be in the category of inheritance - but rather bread and water, as is given to slaves. And the content of its saying, \"[and] the child,\" is not that he also placed the child on her shoulder, with the bread and the water. For he was sixteen or seventeen years old; so how could he place him on her shoulder together with the bread and water? Rather its explanation is that he gave them bread and water and he placed the bread and the water on Hagar's shoulder and also on the child, such that both of them were carrying the bread and the water on their shoulders. But the Ran wrote that since Yishmael was a wild man who would not listen to the voice of his father, they needed to tie him up with ropes and place him on Hagars's shoulder. He [then] commanded that he should be taken to the wilderness. For behold, since he was wild and accustomed to the wilderness, it would be comfortable for him there and he would not come back to his home. And that is why he gave him water; and if it were not to bring him to the wilderness, there would not have been a need for water - as it is found (in inns) on every paved road. And Scripture recounted that Hagar strayed in the wilderness. And because she strayed, the water came to an end in the skin before their coming to the wilderness to which they were going. And when the water came to an end in the skin - being the vessel that held the water - the youth was seized by thirst. For, as the philosopher mentioned, thirst is harder to suffer than hunger. And when Hagar saw the distress of the youth from thirst, she thought he would die from it. And that is why she cast the child under one of the bushes - and those were the trees that were there - so that he would not get heat stroke from the sun. And behold, she distanced herself from him like [the measure of] a bowshot. As she said, \"Let me not see the death of the child,\" and she cried for him. But since she was an Egyptian, God did not lister to her voice - meaning to say, that He was not aroused to have mercy on her, but rather on the youth. And even though the youth did not call out nor yell out, behold it said, \"And God heard the voice of the youth\" - in the sense of, \"the voice of the blood of your brother yells out from the ground\" (Genesis 4:10). As it was the death of Hevel that was calling out [there]. Likewise, it was the difficulty and the pain of Yishmael which was the voice that God heard. And that is why she heard the Godly speech, \"What is the matter, Hagar; do not fear - God has heard the voice of the youth where he is.\" That is to say, \"What is the matter, Hagar - that you are crying; did you think that the youth will die of thirst? The matter is not like this. Rather, even as God did not hear your voice to have mercy upon him in your merit, behold God heard the voice of the youth where he is - from the pain and the difficulty.\" ",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 20_Chapter, 8_Verse, 4_Paragraph": "But it is [also] possible to explain, \"where he is,\" as his not having heard his voice to bring him back to the house of his father, but rather to protect him and have mercy on him where he is - in that wilderness. And the Ramban wrote (Ramban on Genesis 21:17) that He informed them that she would not need to go from there to seek water, since this place would [have water] to quench his thirst. And behold the prophecy came to Hagar for the sake of Avraham, so that she not give up hope on the youth and abandon him. As when Hagar saw that her son was expelled from the house of Avraham with disgrace and defamation, she almost became cruel to him and gave up hope. So perhaps she cast him in anger under one of the bushes, saying that if his father left him, why should she concern herself with him more than [Avraham did]? And that is why she was crying and yelling out - about the poorness of her fate, like someone with a grievance against Avraham. And the Blessed One was concerned lest she leave Yishmael, and that she would also marry someone else - and Yishmael would return to the house of his father; or that Avraham would need to pay attention to him. For he would not leave him cast away and abandoned in the wilderness. That is why the angel came to endear Yishmael in the eyes of Hagar and to command her [to help him]. And for this [reason], he said, \"Get up and lift the youth, and grasp him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.\" And all of this was to fulfill that which was said to Avraham about his son, Yishmael - that He would watch over his affairs. Behold, it follows that it was in the merit of Avraham and because of him that Hagar saw the angel the first time (Genesis 16:7-8), in order to bring her back to his home; and prophecy came to Avimelekh because of him; and prophecy also came to Hagar now because of him, to save his son. And with this, the tenth question is solved. ",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 20_Chapter, 8_Verse, 5_Paragraph": "However [regarding] its saying, \"And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water\" - it is not appropriate that we think that this well was created at this time. For her merit and the merit of Yishmael are not sufficient that He should do a miracle for them like the miracle that was done for Israel in the wilderness. Rather this well was in this land, but Hagar did not see it. So God, may He be blessed, awakened her and guided her to seek it and find it. And this is the meaning of, \"And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water\" - that she saw the well that was there. And you see that the teacher of the Guide (Guide for the Perplexed) in Part II, Chapter 1 brought down that the expression, open [eyes] that is stated in this verse is about revealing knowledge, not about seeing with the eye. And his intention was that which I mentioned - that God awakened Hagar until she investigated it on her own and sought it and found the well. And Scripture recounted that God was with that youth to fulfill what was said about him to Avraham; and that he dwelled in that wilderness and was an archer - as he sustained himself by hunting after he left his father's home without anything. And that is why his descendants - the children of Kedar - dwell to this day in wildernesses [and] are desert peoples. [It further recounted] that his mother took a wife for him from Egypt, since he tended towards their nature and not towards the nature of his honored father. And behold this whole story comes with the name, God (<i>Elohim</i>), about the matter of Yishmael - even though regarding the taking account of Sarah, it is stated, \"And the Lord took account of Sarah as, etc. - because the teaching of Yishmael and his matter is all according to the trait of [strict] justice (associated with that name of God).

And observe this story, and see how it indicates this concept: For behold, Scripture mentioned [that] the reason of, \"And the Philistines stopped up all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham,\" was in order that Issac's shepherds should not benefit from them, and go away from there from lack of water; and besides that, Abimelech told Issac, \"Go away from us, for you have become far too big for us,\" meaning [that] due to the large quantity of his livestock, there was no room for the livestock of the land; [such that] behold, Issac left the land - but he did not distance himself from the city [of Gerar]. As he dwelt in Nachal Gerar, close to the city - and not like Rashi wrote - as since it shares the name Gerar, it appears that it was close to it. [Hence] he dwelt there against their will. Moreover, he returned and dug the wells that Abraham had dug and the Philistines had filled. And in order to govern over them more, he called them by the name his father had called them - to indicate that they were not new. Rather he would open the wells that they had already filled and call them by their names - as he did this by the power of his hand. And they also dug and found a spring of living water... and even though the shepherds of Gerar fought about this well... behold, this well nevertheless stayed with the shepherds of Issac... And they also dug another well - and even though they also fought about it, it stayed with him; and he called it Sitnah, to [mark] their hatred (sinah) towards him. Until, when they dug the third well, they did not fight about it; and he therefore called its name, Rechovot - as Issac said, \"the Lord has widened (hirchiv) and made us fruitful in the land.\" [This] means to say, \"Even though they sent me away from them, the Lord widened it for us in this land, against their will.\" And this is the reason for all of this story - about which Ramban did not find any purpose or glory to Issac - being written here. [However, Ramban] maneuvered to explain it by way of [its] shell [to be] about our holy and glorious Temple. But in my opinion, there is great glory to Issac [in this story], and that is why it is written here. And since Issac did all of these things with a bold heart - as if he was the master of the land - hence in his coming to Beersheba, the Lord appeared to him and promised him, \"I am the Lord of Abraham, your father, do not fear.\" [This] means to say, \"I am the One who gave Abraham your father the power to defeat the kings, and I am the One who gave you the power to act with strength; hence do not fear the men of Gerar, nor about the matter of the wells that you made - as I am with you in all that you do\"... \n\"We did not touch you and we sent you away in peace\" - meaning to say that we did not take anything from all that is yours, but we rather sent you away in peace. As there is no doubt that you are now more blessed of the Lord than when you came to our land. And that proves that you received benefit and goodness in this land, even as it was from God.

        "0_Genesis, 1_, 32_Chapter, 17_Verse, 16_Paragraph": "From \" And Yaakov came complete to the town of Shechem etc.\" until \"And Chamor, the father of Shechem came out\" - Shechem is apparently the city that is close to Mamre Kiriat Arba, since behold when Yaakov was dwelling in Hevron that is Kiriat Arba his sons were sheparding the sheep in Shechem. And it is logical that there was between them a distance of a day maximum, and that is why Yaakov sends  [Yosef] to see how the brothers are faring, and the sheep too, and this was when he is close to where his father was. Despite this, the place where Dina was subjugated was far away from Hevron, where Yitzchak was, and this is a question that remains, since Chazal said that Shechem was a place ready for punishment, since there they subjugated Dina and the tribes were damaged. And from this it appears to me that Shechem was the name of the entire place, and Chamor was the prince of all that land [Abarbanel goes to show where he thinks the connection between Shalem, Shechem and Hevron is]... and the issue with Dina happened in a town named Shalem at the beginning, and it is in a corner of the place called Shechem, and the sons of Yaakov were pasturing the sheep in a different corner, farther away from that area... And it is said that \"Yaakov put his tent in front of the city\" to explain that there were other reasons for this issue [of Dina] to happen: the first one is that Yaakov pitched [his encampment] close to the city, and because of this Dina went out to see the daughters of the land, and if he had pitched in a place farther away, closer to the place of pasturing and farther from the city, Dina would not have come out and what happened would not have happened. Second reason, Yaakov had bought the piece of land where her tent was pitched from Chamor the father of Shechem, and the scripture teaches this by saying that at first he set his tent on the field, and then after the owners complained, he bought that piece of the field, since he did not want to rent it. And since he purchased it from the hand of Chamor, the prince of the land, it makes sense that he paid good money for it, since a prince of the land will not sell parts of his estate to a stranger unless he gave a princely sum. And he did not buy it from the hand of the sons of Chamor, his advanced age prevented him himself to go, but his sons went to make the sale, and this is why they went to the tents of Yaakov, and saw Dina there, and there is no doubt that they spoke with her and the soul of Shechem desired her, and this too was the reason of the continuation [of what happened] when she went out to see the daughters of the land. And this answers the second question. And Ibn Ezra already explained that Yaakov stayed in this city for many years, since Dina was seven years old when she arrived there, and Shimon and Levi were lads. Since Yaakov had entered the holy land, it was for this reason that he bought a piece of the field and became property owner of holy land, and he acquired an altar to praise G-d, that in His great compassion and love brought him to His land and saved him from Lavan... [Abarbanel goes into a discussion on the nature of Judaism, the name E-l and more] And maybe even this altar was a reason for what happened, since once it was ready all his children came to eat from the sacrifices and Shechem and all the town came to see the inauguration of the altar, and saw Dina there, and desired her, and what happened happened once she went out to see the daughters of the land - and this explains the third question. The Torah does not bring the phrase \"and Dina came out\" to criticize Dina as a \"self-exposing daughter of a self-exposer; like mother, like daughter\" as Rashi z\"l has. Leah was a modest woman, to the point that Yaakov did not see anything until the moment he came to her. And the \"Leah went out\" really means that she went out just to the door of her tent and she went out joyfully and with holy intent to greet her husband Yaakov and from that came the birth of Yissachar, the tribe of modest Torah teachers. Also, one cannot say that she is called \"daughter of Leah\" as a criticism of her nature being of \"self-exposing\", since Leah was taught to stay in the tents, and Rachel was the one out with the sheep. And from Yaakov himself was known to be a modest person, hiding in the tents of scholars, and if he was modest like this, all the more his daughter. The intent wasnot for anything bad, as the text says \"daughters of the town\" and not sons of the town. Dina had no sisters, being the only maiden in the house and so she went out to see how the girls of the town dressed and used jewelry, and this explains our fourth question. And there is no doubt that she did not went out by herself, without the company of a man or a woman, and this is implied, just as the scripture has regarding Moses, that he went out to meet his father-in-law, and obviously he did not go alone. The text describes that Shechem was \"the son of Chamor the Hivite, the prince of the land\" to make sure that we understand that being the prince of the land he used force, and had no fear of those who were with Dinah or of the sons of Yaakov. And the text goes on to say, like Rashi explains, that he lay with her in the usual fashion and afflicted her in the unusual fashion, and how can one describe his doing such a disgrace. And Ibn Ezra explains that her being a virgin, and he doing three things - seizing her by force while she was passing through the market, forcing her in the natural way and in the unnatural way.And even if you know about the second thing, why is the text bringing the first? Isn't it already included? This is to teach that even if he wanted to have relations with her due to his wanting her as a wife, one cannot do this by force. The second comes to teach that he destroyed her virginity. And why is it explaining that he afflicted her? To explain that she did not go by her own will, but he hoped that it would being by her being forced and end by her wanting it.[...]",

The first was that, despite being but a slave, with a depressed spirit, he nonetheless enjoyed Divine influence to such a degree that when he heard a dream, he could interpret it in accordance with what would actually transpire in the future – and it was impossible for this to be on account of (his) inherent gift of discernment, simple knowledge (of current events), and well-developed analytical powers possessed by him, as such powers are variable in their results – they do indeed predict the truth on some occasions, whilst on others they fail to do so. (We are thus forced to conclude that) it was the spirit of the Almighty speaking through him, and that His word was upon his (Joseph’s) tongue; and accordingly, not a single one of his predictions failed to be fulfilled; he could also see dreams fulfilled in accordance with his predictions; and it is thus, in relation to all this, that Scripture states: <b>‘And the Almighty was with Joseph’</b>. The second (act of Divine grace) was that he succeeded in all his affairs. Concerning this aspect, we are told, <b>‘And he was a successful person’</b> in that whatever he turned his hand to prospered. The third (act of Divine grace) was that, despite the general custom amongst high-ranking officials, on purchasing a slave, to leave him to labor in the fields, [indeed the Egyptians, in particular, would treat Hebrews in this fashion, as they were hated by them on account of their (i.e. the Hebrews) being meat-eaters], in this instance the Almighty favored him in his master’s house by allowing him to remain working inside the house, (even) in Egypt, where he could relax, rather than dispatching him to the fields to toil away there. In regard to this point, the verse emphasizes: <b>‘And he was in the house of his Egyptian master’</b>. Moreover, since each of these three (acts of grace) were quite distinct, the narrative repeatedly utilizes the word <b>‘va’yehi’</b> (‘and he was’) in each particular instance.

It was due to this that his master elevated him to a higher status. Until now, he had been serving in his master’s home, but not inside his ‘inner sanctum’; he had not been attending upon his master in his inner chamber. But at this juncture, he (Potiphar) elevated his working status in three ways: first, he (Joseph) ministered directly to his master, by dressing and feeding him – this is what is meant by the phrase <b>‘and he ministered to him’</b>; secondly, he appointed him in charge of his entire household, i.e. that he (Joseph) could henceforth command all the servants employed there to carry out such tasks as befitted them: thirdly, he handed over control of all his possessions to Joseph, by creating him guardian of his treasures and his riches.",

For previously, the Torah relates: ‘And he appointed him over his household, and handed over all his possessions to him’ i.e. his treasures – yet his master was aware of what was in the house, and he (Joseph) would account to him on a daily basis. However, once he had observed his success and his uprightness of character – <b>‘he was not cognizant of anything in Joseph’s possession’</b> (39:6), insofar as he did not demand any reckoning from him, as is customary amongst administrational delegators.

As to obtaining glory, <b>‘even my master himself is not of higher rank in the household than I am’</b> – by which he meant to say: <b>‘whilst it is possible that within the king’s household, he is greater than I, in this household, he is not’</b>. And as regards fulfillment of a pledge, my master has withheld nothing from me besides you, and that too is only because of your being his wife – i.e. insofar as your marital status is concerned; but not in any other respect. Accordingly, if all that remains to him is yourself, on account of your marriage to him, how can I perpetrate so great an evil as to remove you forcibly from him? – for by doing so, I would be acting like a traitor and a thief in respect of what was placed in my care. Furthermore, even if he knew nothing of the affair, and I could thus not be called a sinner against him personally, still, there can be no doubt that the sin would be against God, Who is aware of secret matters’.

Consequently, from then onwards, when she used to speak to him every day – our Sages indeed tell us that this went on for twelve months! – he would not listen to what she said, to avoid himself becoming seduced. Now she, as mistress of the house, would sit on the ground – as is customary for ladies of that rank – on a rug made of linen and embroidered wool – and high-ranking officials, when coming to converse with them, would (customarily) lie down on those very rugs to conduct their dialogue. She was accordingly continually urging Joseph to lie down beside her on the rug so that she could speak to him, but he (for his part) had no desire to approach her. This, then, is the (full) purport of the verse (found here) :(39:10): <b>‘But he paid no heed to her, to lie by her side, to be with her’</b>. On perceiving that she would not accept his efforts to extricate himself (from her clutches), he chose to shut his ears and neither to listen to anything she said, nor, needless to say, to venture close to her in the place where she was seated.\n",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 38_Chapter, 11_Verse, 0_Paragraph": "Accordingly, when the power of her love overwhelmed her, and he was no longer paying any attention to her words, she seized him by his robe, reasoning that, once she had been so bold as to grab hold of it, he would be ashamed to despise her and tell her (outright): ‘I do not desire you!’ He, for his part, for fear that he would let himself be seduced by her advances and her conduct, fled away from her presence, and went outside, not even tarrying to extricate his robe from her hand so that she would not seize and kiss him. This is what Scripture intends to convey by (the expression) <b>‘he fled’</b> (39:12). He also did not wish to extract his garment from her hand by superior force because she was, after all, his mistress, so that she was able to detach it from him; as it was a robe in which he would envelop himself, like a cloak, as Nahmanides has stated (in his commentary on this passage).",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 38_Chapter, 12_Verse, 0_Paragraph": "She, for her part, seeing that he had left his robe in her hand and had fled outside naked – something which is not done – thought that, without doubt, if his master arrived on the scene, he would question him as to what had occurred, and Joseph would be compelled to reply to him to excuse himself for walking about outside the house naked; and that when he would tell him the truth as to what had taken place, her nefarious conduct would become public knowledge. This, then, is the correct interpretation of the verse: <b>‘Now it transpired, that when she saw that he had left his robe in her hand and fled outside’</b> (39:13) – for had he not done both these things, she would not have suspected him of revealing the incident; just as she too had not disclosed it till now. However, as he had fled outside naked, whoever saw him – and most certainly his master – would be prompted to demand an explanation from him; and he in turn would be forced to disclose the incident. It was due to such considerations (only) that she (decided to) act cunningly, for fear of the shame she would suffer on being discovered by the members of the household. Hence she herself publicized the affair, by exclaiming:(39:14): <b>‘Look how he (my husband) has brought us a Hebrew man’</b> – an enemy of the Egyptian nation – and promoted him over his household; and he, for his part, perceiving this, had the temerity to mock me!’ [in the sense of the Biblical verse (Proverbs 29:21): ‘he who pampers his slave from his youth will ultimately find the slave lording it over him!’] With such an interpretation of the passage, the third question we initially posed has been satisfactorily resolved.\n",

However, he was still troubled by this episode, and accordingly put him in prison – had he not acted in this way, he would have become a laughing-stock, as his wife was (already) saying as much. By remaining silent, he would have provided her with a pretext for being unfaithful to him. This, then, is what Scripture intends to convey by the phrase, <b>‘And when his master heard the words of his wife’</b> (39:19): – for he was not unduly affected by the incident itself, since he lent it no credence; nor was he influenced by the robe found in her hand – as he undoubtedly questioned Joseph about it, and was told the truth. The Torah mentions this only briefly, as it is quite clear from the basic drift of the narrative. Hence it does not say (39:19): ‘And his fury was aroused against Joseph’, but simply, <b>‘his fury was aroused’</b>. He was angered by what his wife had said, and his mind pre-occupied with what to do to appease her, given that she was insisting on her version of events. Accordingly, he resolved to incarcerate Joseph in the prison-house, which was under his control and located within the precincts of his own home, to remain there until (his wife’s) fury had subsided.\n",

This is what is meant by the verse <b>‘And Joseph’s master took him, and placed him in the prison-house’</b>. (39:20). However, he did not put him in the area where men of lowly rank were imprisoned by order of the city’s judiciary, but in the section where royal prisoners were incarcerated; for inside the jail were various chambers and storeys, each separate from one another; and Joseph was placed in that very room where those princes imprisoned by royal command had been assigned.",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 38_Chapter, 19_Verse, 1_Paragraph": "As for the next phrase, <b>‘and he remained there in the prison-house’</b>, we must understand this to mean that he (Potiphar) placed him there, as this was to be his punishment, i.e. to remain there at his pleasure for a period of time; and he was to receive no further punishment.\n",
        "0_Genesis, 1_, 38_Chapter, 20_Verse, 0_Paragraph": "Scripture then goes on to relate: <b>‘And the Almighty was with Joseph and extended grace towards him, and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison governor’</b> (39:21). We should note that, whereas in regard to Joseph’s master (Potiphar), who was a high-ranking official, Scripture (deliberately) employs the (more neutral) expression ‘he found favor in his sight’, in the case of the governor of the jail, who was cruel by nature, showing neither pity nor mercy [such a nature well suited his job, as he would inevitably be in the company of wrongdoers and sinful men all day long], – so that Joseph’s finding favor with him would be truly miraculous – Scripture relates: <b>‘The Almighty was with Joseph and extended him grace, granting him favor (even) with the governor of the jail’</b>. This was nothing less than a miracle, taking into account the governor’s base character. Indeed, (Joseph found favor with him) to such an extent that the governor delegated control of all the prisoners to him, and he was appointed to watch over all their comings and goings. Now, since the poorest element amongst a group of prisoners continue with the performance of their regular occupations whilst in jail so as to allow them to earn some money, and it would be risky to permit outsiders to visit them to buy such items from them as they had made themselves, in case the prisoners plotted an escape, all their business affairs and dealings were directed through Joseph. This, then, is the underlying meaning of the phrase (39:22): <b>‘and everything they did there was done by him’</b> – as they carried out all their activities under his supervision. Rashi states in his commentary on this verse that everything was done at Joseph’s command and with his permission; and undoubtedly Joseph too obtained some personal benefit from this arrangement; hence the next verse goes on to say: (39:23): <b>‘The prison governor saw nothing of all that passed through (Joseph’s) hand’</b> – as he did not bother to check whether Joseph would obtain material benefit from it or not.",

It also includes honoring Torah scholars, who are like fathers to their disciples, heeding the prophets, showing respect to the elderly and obeying the Sanhedrin. The purpose of this <i>mitzvah</i> is to bolster faith in tradition by honoring its bearers. That is why it is listed on the first Tablet along with the commandments between man and God. <b>So that your days may be lengthened.</b> This is in recompense for his good deed towards his forebears. Alternatively, it is to enable his own children to honor <i>him</i>, measure for measure; therefore when this commandment is repeated in <i>Devarim</i> (5:16) the Torah adds, “in order that it will be good for you” (<i>Abarbanel</i>).",

Five on one tablet and five on the other. It is written, \"I am the Lord your God,\" and opposite it, \"You shall not murder\" - since spilling blood is tantamount to diminishing the likeness [of God]. It is written, \"There shall not be unto you [any other gods],\" and opposite it, \"You shall not commit adultery,\" saying that anyone worshipping idolatry is tantamount to adultery against the Omnipresent. It is written, \"You shall not take [the name of the Lord your God in vain],\" and opposite it, \"You shall not steal,\" saying that anyone who steals - in the end - comes to swear in vain, as it is written (Jeremiah 7:9), \"Shall one steal, murder, commit adultery, [swear falsely].\" And it is written (Hosea 4:2), \"swearing, lying, [murdering, stealing].\" It is written, \"Remember the Sabbath day,\" and opposite it, \"You shall not testify falsely against your fellow\" - Scripture is saying that anyone who desecrates the Sabbath testifies before Him who spoke and brought the world into being that He did not rest on the seventh day; and anyone who keeps the Sabbath thereby testifies about [God's] creation of the world, as it is written (Isaiah 43:10), \"You are My witnesses, says the Lord.\" It is written, \"Honor your father [and your mother],\" and opposite it, \"You shall not covet,\" saying that anyone who covets - in the end - comes to beget a son who curses his father, and honors one who is not his father. This is why the Ten Commandments were given, five on one tablet and five on the other, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 5:19), \"The Lord spoke those words, etc. and He wrote them [on two tablets of stone].\" These are the words of Rabbi Chanina ben Gamliel. But the sages say: Ten were on one tablet and ten on the other, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 5:19) \"The Lord spoke those words, etc. and He wrote them [on two tablets of stone].\" To here [are the words of the Mekhilta]. This is the approach of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, about the organization of these Commandments and their need. However, according to what I explained in the verses, the first five were on one tablet due to their relating to matters of divinity; and the last five on [another] tablet due to their relating to  [that which] is between a man and his fellow - according to the opinion of Rabbi Chanina, which is the more logical. And the tablets were therefore two. For if all of the Commandments were on each one of the tablets, there would not have been a need for two tablets, but rather [only] one. And because of this, the name, Lord, and the name, God, is mentioned in each of the five first Commandments that were on one tablet, to indicate that they were commandments about divinity. However, in that the last fives ones are all about humanity - between a man and his fellow - none of the holy names [of God] are mentioned in any of them. And this is that which the Sages, may their memory be blessed, intended in their saying (Shemot Rabbah 80:47): The two tablets correspond to the heavens and the earth, to a groom and a bride, to two friends and to two worlds. As through this, they wanted to distinguish between the two tablets, according to what I have explained. And behold, there is no doubt that there are other commandments included in the Commandment, \"You shall not murder\" - as I mentioned. For murder is stated about the killing of a soul - like (Numbers 35:2) \"and the blood-avenger [murders] the murderer\"; but it is also stated about blows and wounds - like (Psalms 42:11), \"Murdering my bones\"; (Hosea 6:9), \"murdering on the way to Shekhem\"; (Psalms 62:4), \"all of you murder him like a leaning wall.\" For it compared someone hit and \"murdered\" to a leaning wall, that is ready to fall but has not yet fallen. And the word, murderer, is also stated about one who causes death, even though he does not kill with his hands (actively) - like (Judges 20:4) \"the husband of the murdered woman.\" And they slept with her and did not kill her, but she was murdered as a result of [their actions]. And according to all of these usages, it is fit to understand, \"You shall not murder,\" about one who kills a soul and one who strikes his fellow [with] 'bruises and wounds, that are repayment for evil.' And that one not go talebearing is also included in this Commandment, for he causes the [potential] murder. And also included in this Commandment is that one not refrain from charity to the poor, and [from] the commandment of \"and your brother shall live with you\" (Leviticus 25:36) - as it is written (Deuteronomy 15:9), \"so that you are mean to your needy brother and give him nothing, and he will cry out to the Lord against you, and you will incur sin.\" For one who withholds charity is killing the souls of the poor and the destitute. And also included in this negative commandment is the release of Hebrew slaves on the seventh year, and of the Hebrew maidservant, as is coming up. For if he detains them more than is the law; it is like killing and negating them from the world. And also included in this Commandment - according to the opinion of the Sages, may their memory be blessed - is one who whitens the face of (embarrasses) his fellow about a blemish that he or his ancestors had; and also one who infringes upon his fellow's trade, one who prevents his sustenance from him and one who competes (unfairly); and the one who slanders and the one who hands over his fellow - all of these are included in \"You shall not murder.\" And all forbidden sexual relations and all types of adulterers are included in the Commandment, \"You shall not commit adultery\" - as was mentioned by Rabbi Avraham ibn Ezra. For even though adultery (<i>niuf</i>) is said specifically about one who sleeps with a married woman, see that it is also stated generally about all other sexual prohibitions - and as it stated (Job 24:15), \"The eyes of the adulterer watch for twilight, saying, 'No eye will see me.'\" And there are also many commandments included in the Commandment, \"You shall not steal.” For the word, thief, is sometimes stated about one who kidnaps one of his brothers - like the words [of the Sages,] may their memory be blessed - and it also stated about one who takes his fellow's money without his knowledge, as it is written (Exodus 22:1), \"If the thief is seized while tunneling\"; and it is stated about withholding a pledge and exploitation, since it is taking a person's property against his will. Hence it is stated (Leviticus 5:21), \"or by holding a pledge, or through robbery, or by defrauding his kinsman\" - as it all called holding a pledge, which is theft. And the word, theft, is also stated about fraud and deceit - like (Genesis 31:20), \"And Jacob stole Lavan's heart\"; (Job 4:12) \"A stolen word came to me.\" And from this angle and aspect, even oppressive words are called theft. And according to these usages, the Commandment of \"Do not steal\" includes kidnapping, stealing money or vessels, robbery and exploitation; the commandment of \"a man shall not oppress his brother\" (Leviticus 25:14), and \"Stay away from a false thing (Exodus 23:7); all matters of theft and fooling people; the commandment of \"You shall not render an unfair decision\" (Leviticus 19:15) with size, weight and length; and all of the other commandments I mentioned above. And as for why the Commandment of \"You shall not commit adultery,\" came between \"You shall not murder\" and \"You shall not steal,\" it is surely because a wife is, from one aspect, like a man's body - bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh - but from another aspect, she is like his acquisitions and his money. Hence this Commandment is stated between \"You shall not murder\" and \"You shall not steal.\" And once it warned a man not to injure his fellow with bad deeds - not towards his wife, his body or his money - it warned him also not to injure him with the words of his lips. And that is its stating, \"You shall not testify falsely against your fellow.\" And besides this prohibition that a person not testify falsely; also included in it is one who mocks his fellow, one who speaks evil speech, one who talebears, one who whitens the face of his fellow in public and that which is similar to them from the commandments that I mentioned.  And after this, it warned that a man not injure his fellow with his thoughts. And that is, \"You shall not covet.\" And Rabbi Avraham ibn Ezra explained that this Commandment is not only in thought, since coveting is also stated about robbing something desirable, as it is stated (Micah 2:2), \"They covet fields, and rob.\" And, if so, it is warning with this about robbing that is a continuation of the act of coveting, and also about the internal coveting itself. And the great rabbi, Maimonides, agreed with this in the Book of Damages, Laws of Robbery and Lost Property 5 - that one does not transgress the negative commandment of \"You shall not covet\" until he takes an object that he coveted - which is coveting with an action. But desire (Deuteronomy 5:18) is only in the heart. And there are some of the decisors that disagree with him about this. And Rabbi Avraham ibn Ezra put effort into explaining that a person has the power to accustom himself to uphold this prohibition of \"You shall not covet,\" even in the heart. And that is when a person accustoms himself to be satisfied with what he has, like he accustoms himself to the prohibition of forbidden sexual relations and that which is similar to it. And it mentioned the desired things according to [the order of] a man's need for them and that which it is fit for a man to expend efforts to acquire in his world. And that is why it first mentioned the coveting of a house; and then a wife; and then a slave and maidservant; and then an ox and donkey, that are animals that do not speak. And Scripture grouped the other things that are not so necessary when it stated, \"and anything that is your fellow's.\" But in Mishneh Torah (Deuteronomy), it mentioned them according to the severity of the sin and the evil. For the most evil coveting is the coveting of a man for his fellow's wife, like the desire of David for Bathsheba. And after it in evil is the coveting of a man for his fellow's house, and afterwards the field. For even if a man does not live in it - like he lives in his house - it is surely the place of his nourishment and the inheritance of his ancestors, as it was in the matter of Ahab with the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. And after the field, it mentioned the slave and the maidservant that are not as esteemed as the field; and afterwards, the ox and donkey, which do not speak; and after them, it wanted to group all of the movable property that is not living - \"and everything that is your fellow's.\" And I have already mentioned that these last five Commandments came with extreme terseness, because they are things that the human intellect understands, and because the first three of them were from the commandments that the Children of Noah were [already] commanded. Hence it does not say the word, \"your fellow\" here - meaning to say, \"You shall not murder your fellow, you shall not commit adultery with your fellow's wife; you shall not steal from that which is your fellow's.\" As the whole world was already prohibited about [these things], whereas the Israelites were [deemed] fellows from the angle of the Torah which they received and by which they were united. However, with the commandment, \"You shall not testify,\" it stated, \"Your fellow\" - and likewise with \"You shall not covet.\" For the Holy One, blessed be He, added these two commandments to command them now to the Israelites, given that they were beloved fellows from once they received the Torah. And from that angle, and since they were the Children of Jacob - the seed of the blessed one of the Lord, it was fit that they not perpetrate injustice and that there not be expressions of deceit and bad desires in their mouths and hearts. And I also say that a double prohibition come upon coveting - in that it states, \"You shall not covet your fellow's house; you shall not covet your fellow's wife\" - because, as mentioned by the Medini (Aristotle), love and desire [of something] can be [because it is] useful or [because it is] enjoyable. And since they are different things, the negative commandment mentions [coveting] twice, as if it were saying, do not covet something wrong from that which is useful like a house or a field, and do not covet something wrong from that which is enjoyable like a woman. And with this, the second question is resolved. And Rabbi Avraham ibn Ezra already mentioned a different opinion about these Ten Commandments - that they are corresponding to the heavenly spheres, and he related each one to its sphere; and he felt that it was about this that it stated (Exodus 20:19), \"you saw that I spoke to you from the heavens.\" But because these are tangible things, 'my soul is bewildered by them.'

For if the second set of tablets were to replace the first set, it would be appropriate for them to be identical in all respects; however, the first set were both carved and inscribed by God, while the second set were carved by Moses, who did not inscribe them, and inscribed by God, who did not carve them.",

Indeed, in reference to His passing the verse says \"before him.\"  And pay no mind to the teaching that explains that the phrase \"the Lord passed before him\" means that, in response to Moses' desire to see the Lord's face, the Lord changed the subject by enumerating the attributes, for this is not supportable from the grammar or the context.

But calling out the Lord's honored name is not speaking down.

And the Psalmist said, \"the iniquities of my youth and my sins do not remember.\" And erase the crime.  Why did each one of these complete Sages independently invoke the erasure of crimes?

        "1_Exodus, 1_, 33_Chapter, 0_Verse, 16_Paragraph": "Response: \"And the Lord said to Moses, 'Carve for yourself' ... and Moses carved two tablets of stone.\"  The opinion of all authentic scholars is that Moses stood upon the mountain three times, forty days and forty night each time, for a total of four months and two days, with two additional days of descent in the interim.  For on the day that Moses initially descended, he destroyed the tablets, and the verse (Exodus 32) then states, \"On the following day, Moses said to the nation, 'You have sinned\" ... and now I will ascend to the Lord and will stand and pray there forty more days until your sins are forgiven.\"  On his second descent, the verse states, \"Moses awoke in the morning,\" it was four months and four days from the sixth day of Sivan (the date of Moses' first ascent) to Yom Kippur, which was on the tenth day of Tishrei.  And the order of the verses here supports this timeline.  Additionally, we have the verse from Deuteronomy (5:15) where Moses recounts three times that he stood upon Mt. Sinai, forty days each time, as it states, \"As I ascended to the mountain ... and I stayed upon the mountain forty days and forty nights.\"  And the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, and this is the first stay upon the mountain.  Afterwards, the verse states, \"I prostrated before the Lord as I did the first time, forty days and forty nights ... for all of your sins,\" and this is the second stay upon the mountain (and with respect to this, Moses also said, \"I prostrated myself before the Lord forty days and forty nights that I prostrated ...\" which are the days of the second ascent, which is recounted again so that Moses could share the prayer that he prayed at that time.  Afterwards he said, \"At that time, the Lord said to me, 'Carve for yourself two tablets of stone similar to the first ones' ... and I stood upon the mountain as I did the first time, for forty days and forty nights. And this was the third stay upon the mountain. \"And He answered,\" and with this answer the forgiveness was completed... And God said to Moses, \"Carve for yourself,\" to inform him that he would not merit the complete vision of the testimony except through the Torah which was given by his hands, for without this Moses would not have achieved this level of spiritual greatness.  And the reason for the word \"yourself\" was to warn Moses that he himself, and no other, should carve the tablets.  For the word \"yourself\" connotes isolation, as it was written [with respect to Abraham], \"Go yourself from your land ...\" that Abraham should go without his father or relatives (as explained there).  Similarly [with respect to the spies sent to Canaan], \"Send for yourself men ...\" that Moses should send them alone, apart from the rest of the nation.  And here, God saw that the tablets encompassed two miraculous qualities.  The first was that the workmanship was divine work, done in a miraculous fashion, and the second was the inscription, which was divinely written.  When Moses shattered the tablets, the workmanship and form was lost, but the words inscribed were not destroyed or lost. Therefore, God commanded Moses to carve the stone to make new tablets, ready to be inscribed, for it was Moses' obligation since he destroyed the first set of tablets.  However, He said the inscription would not be written by Moses, because he did not destroy ",

Rather, the intent of this is that they are signs that indicate that this animal is pure, and their absence indicates that it is impure.  And the reason is that animals that possess these signs generally have flesh that is pleasant for human consumption, because the cause for bringing up the cud is that the animal does not have molars in its upper jaw to grind its food, and on this account, it cannot eat bones, but only grasses, which it swallows whole, and when they are softened in the belly by the natural heat, it brings them up through its throat and grinds them with its jaws and swallows them a second time.  And these species of animals are fat and good for human consumption, because they find own food everywhere, and their temperamental mixture is more even, because they feed on grasses, both moist and dry, and because of this, these animals are not cruel, carnivorous, or wicked.",
        "2_Leviticus, 1_, 10_Chapter, 12_Verse, 1_Paragraph": "Regarding the Torah's prohibition of foods, many of the commentators have thought that it is because of the body's health and medical care, those foods being bad, and generating a harmful moistness.  This is the view of the Ramban, on the verse, \"these you shall abhor among the birds\" (Lev. 11:13).  But God forbid that I should believe this, because if that were the case, the divine Sefer Torah would be on the level of a minor book among the books of medicine -- short in both words and reasoning.  And this is not the way of the divine Torah, or the depth of its purpose.  Further, we can see with our own eyes that the nations that eat the flesh of the pig, the creepers, the mouse, and the other impure birds, beasts, and fish are all alive to this day, \"firm as a mirror of cast metal\" (Job 37:18), and there is none tired or weak among them.  Also, there are other animals that are well known to be harmful, like the viper, snake, serpent, and scorpion, that are not mentioned here among the category of prohibitions.  And there are also grasses and plants that are very injurious and deadly poisonous, like the alisor and its like, among those mentioned by the medical experts, and the Torah does not prohibit their consumption.  And all of this shows that the divine Torah does not come to heal the bodies, or to seek their health, but rather to promote the health of the soul and to heal its ailments, and therefore, it forbade foods that sully and abominate the pure and sublime soul, and that engender in the human temperamental mixture an impenetrability and a distortion of desires, by creating a bad mixture that gives rise to a spirit of pollution that defiles the mind and the deeds, and that expels the spirit of purity and holiness for which David prayed: \"Do not take Your holy spirit away from me\" (Ps. 51:13).  And he said \"Fashion a pure heart for me, O God; create in me a steadfast spirit\" (id. 12).  And it was because of this that He, may He be blessed, said, \"You shall not draw abomination upon yourselves through anything that swarms; you shall not make yourselves impure therewith\" (Lev. 11:43).  For in this consists the idea of impenetrability and impurity.  And Scripture does not call them \"injurious\" or \"disease-causing,\" but \"impure\" and \"abominable,\" showing that the rationale for the prohibition is on account of the soul and not on account of the body and its health.  It was necessary for the wholeness, clarity, and purity of the soul that the bodily temperament would be right, and that its food would create blood that was pure and refined, and not gross and thick and not right, as would be created by the forbidden foods.  And also the forbidden foods were related to the idolaters.  And even today in the land of India, it is forbidden to eat from the herd or from the flock, as the Master [Rambam] says in his Guide.  And in other countries, they eat forbidden foods because of their religion, and that is why these foods are called \"abominations,\" as idolatry is called \"abomination.\"  ",

        "3_Numbers, 1_, 12_Chapter, 16_Verse, 0_Paragraph": "Behold, if so, from these six questions which Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - commanded to the scouts that they know and return the word to him, there was not one that the people asked, when they said (Deuteronomy 1:22), \"and they will return to us the word: the path that we shall go up upon, and the cities that we shall come unto\" - as Moshe did not command that they should know anything about the paths nor what cities were more fitting to conquer first. And also the scouts in their answers did not respond to this at all. But [rather], Moshe in his knowing the evil of the people, [understood] that there was to know whether the land was good and broad, plentiful of food and plentiful of settlement, in [such] a way that they would eat and be satiated and greatly delight upon it. And [so] he commanded them the two questions about the inhabited land and the two last questions about the land that is worked and sown. However, the other two questions Moshe invented himself, to ask about them. And this was in order that they know that the enemies were a large and strong nation and that the cities were fortified into the skies; and with this, they would recognize and know that their Savior is strong, and that it would not be with their [own] strength that they would inherit the land, and that their forearms would not deliver them. And hence they would increase their clinging to God, may He be blessed, and call to Him, 'since it is a time of trouble for Yaakov and from it he shall be delivered.' Behold, it has become clear from this that Moshe did not ask about the land, \"whether it is good or bad,\"  because of his being in doubt about the divine designs - God forbid - but rather to answer their questions, in his thinking that for this did they request to send scouts, as I elucidated; and that he only asked them, \"are they strong or weak, are they few or are they many,\" in order to sway their hearts to return to God and to supplicate in front of Him, 'since to God is deliverance,' and that they should say, \"Let us go and return to God,  so that He should do with us all of His wonders,\" and like he did at the [Reed] Sea. And it appears to me in truth that our master, Moshe, sinned in these first two questions that he asked about the people and the cities, as Israel did not ask them and also God, may He be blessed,  did not command about them, but [rather] he asked them on his own. And there is no doubt that his intention was good, but there came out from it what came out - 'like an error that goes out in front of the ruler.' And since 'an error in study is considered an intentional transgression,' the master of the prophets was punished.",

And the philosophers already thought that it was [necessary] and that the dominion of a king to a politically organized nation is like the relationship of the heart to the body of a living being that has a heart, and like the relationship of the First Cause to the world more generally. And even though these analysts reason that monarchy insures three things – the first being unity and the absence of [division], the second being continuity and the lack of [instability], and the third being absolute power – [in fact], their thinking about the obligation and necessity of a king is actually false. [This] since it is not to be denied that there can be many leaders of the people that gather and unite and agree upon one policy and that the leadership and law be according to them – and this goes against the first [claim]. And why should their leadership not be [for] one year or three years like the years of an employee or less? And when the turn of other 'judges and officers' arrives, they will rise instead of them and faithfully investigate the sin of the first ones, and that which they condemn must pay all that they have done badly – and this goes against the second [claim]. And why should their power also not be limited, as with religions and mores [– and this goes against the third claim]. And logic dictates that when an individual [disagrees] with a group, the law follows the group. And it is more likely that the lapse be with one man – as it stated (Proverbs 16:14), “The king’s wrath is a messenger of death” - than it be that the many would trespass when they take counsel together. As if one strays from the path, the others will protest against him. And since their leadership is temporary and they will have to be accountable after a 'few days,' that fear of flesh and blood is upon them. And why do we need to bring theoretical claims for this, as behold, experience trumps modeling: Look and see the lands the leadership of which is with kings, and [by contrast,] today we have seen many lands the leadership of which is is with temporary judges and leaders that are chosen among them and the King God is with them. Their law is refined by ordered limits, and [their leaders] are the ones that control the people that make the matters of war; none can stand in front of them – not from a tribe, and not from his land. Did you not know, did you not hear that a great land governed over the whole world, consumed the whole earth – search it and note it – while its leadership was through the Councils, that were wholesome and many and their leadership was temporary. However, afterward they were made a tributary. And also today, the Commonwealth of Venice, that great mistress among the nations, the rulers over states; and the Country of Florence, the beauty of all the lands; and other countries small and large are run by the mouth of leaders elected for set periods of time. And behold, the elected governments have 'in them nothing perverse or crooked' – no one raises his hand or foot to [do] a wrongful thing – and they conquer lands that are not theirs with wisdom, understanding and knowledge. And all of this shows that the presence of a king is not necessary for a nation, and like the teacher of the Guide (Maimonides) mentioned. And it is a wonder about this supposed opinion, that compares the unity of a [human] king over the control and will of people to the unity of the ancient necessary First Cause, may He be blessed. However, [even] in an animal body, the sages have already written that there are three main organs in its governance. And even according to the opinion of the head of the philosophers that only the heart is the main [one], behold, this is concerning the generation of the spirit, but it does not contradict that the government of the living faculties is from the brain, and the natural ones is from the liver. In the final analysis, it is impossible for natural matters not to be like this; as from the act of [Divine] will, they are [only] from the substance of that [which] is possible - ‘how can straw be compared to grain?’ And one should not ask from the statement (Proverbs 28:2), “When there is rebellion in the land, its ministers are many,” as there it is speaking about ministers, not about leaders and judges. And how will we [miss] that which is well-known among all, that when the leaders are good, it is better that they be many; and if they are bad, it is more dangerous. And therefore, I think that the kings were not set up with the examination of the people at first, and as it is written (Isaiah 7:6), “We will march against Yehudah and invade it […], and we will set up a king in it.” And even if they were only appointed by way of trustees to serve the people, and they are made masters, as if God, may He be blessed, gave them the ‘land and its fullness’; and they bequeathed it to their sons after them forever, as if it was land that he bought with his money, this too is ‘not worthwhile (literally, the same)’ with all reigns, as there will be kings that do not have leadership abilities.
