        "1_, 0_Chapter, 20_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>And thus Elokim created.</b> Unlike the dry land, the sea was not imbued with sufficient power to produce living souls on its own. It was necessary, therefore, for Hashem to intervene directly in the production of the sea creatures. For the same reason marine fauna becomes sparser the further one goes from the shore.",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 24_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>The beasts.</b> This refers to beasts of prey such as the lion and the bear, which are imbued with an affinity for unpopulated regions to minimize the harm that they do. ",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 24_Verse, 3_Comment": "<b>Everything that creeps.</b> These also favor desolate areas, with the exception of a few harmless species. The name <i>remes</i> alludes to their scurrying manner of locomotion. Note that no mention at all is made of the maggots generated by rotting things. ",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 24_Verse, 4_Comment": "<b>And Elokim saw that it was good.</b> Even harmful creatures have beneficial uses. For example, snake flesh is used as an antidote for poison. Alternatively, the “good” is that every creature possesses the faculties necessary for its survival: predators — claws and strength, prey — speed and wariness. And all are provided with abundant sources of nourishment.",
        "1_, 1_Chapter, 8_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Pleasant to look at.</b> The trees of the Garden were exceptionally beautiful and stately. <b>And good for food.</b> All the trees of the Garden bore fruit and their produce was superior to that of all other trees. Adam dwelt in the Garden for only a brief time and his offspring not at all. Therefore all the fruit remains for Israel to enjoy in the Messianic Age. <b>The Tree of Life.</b> By nature this tree granted health and long life.",

        "1_, 2_Chapter, 5_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>That the tree was good for food.</b> She saw that its fruit was as appealing as that of other trees and should presumably be just as edible. Why, then, should it be any more harmful than the others? Moreover, she reasoned, the serpent was probably correct that it was effective as a means of obtaining wisdom.<br><b>And she also gave it to her husband <i>with her</i>.</b> They ate of it together. Thus she ate twice and he ate once.",
        "1_, 2_Chapter, 7_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>They heard.</b> They understood that it was Hashem’s voice coming to rebuke them. <b>The man and his wife hid themselves.</b> They were embarrassed because the fig leaves did not cover their nakedness well. Hashem intentionally forewarned them of His impending revelation so that they could hide themselves, from which it can be inferred that one should never enter a room unannounced.",
        "1_, 2_Chapter, 13_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Cursed are you.</b> Unlike Adam and Chavah, the serpent had no excuse at all; therefore Hashem did not wait for him to reply but cursed him straight away.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 1_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>She gave birth again.</b> The fact that there is no mention of a second conception lends support to the <i>Midrash</i> (<i>Bereishis Rabbah</i> 22) according to which Kayin and Hevel were twins. <b>She gave birth again.</b> Literally, “She continued to give birth.” The Sages explain that each son was born with a female twin, thus there was a “continuation” to his birth. <b>She gave birth … to … Hevel.</b> “The sons of men are nothing,” (see <i>Tehillim</i> 62:10). Perhaps after their expulsion Chavah sensed the precariousness of the human condition.",

Some say this means at the end of a year (see <i>Vayikra</i> 25:30). <b>Some fruit.</b> No mention is made of which fruit, but apparently it was of an inferior variety or perhaps he offered what was left over after he had taken for his own needs. According to <i>Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer</i> he offered flax seed. Thus garments of flax and wool are forbidden to avoid mingling Kayin’s offering with that of Hevel.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 4_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>But to Kayin and his offering.</b> Hashem was not pleased with Kayin because his intentions were not praiseworthy, nor was He pleased with his offering because it was of inferior quality. <b>And depressed (literally, “his face fell”).</b> Kayin lowered his face like one who is ashamed.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 8_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Ad-noy then said.</b> Hashem’s intention was to demonstrate that it is impossible to hide one’s deeds from Him. <b>I know not.</b> Since Hashem did not ask straight out, “Why did you kill your brother?” Kayin still thought that His knowledge was limited.",
        "1_, 3_Chapter, 10_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Now you are cursed.</b> This seems to suggest that the curse applied to Kayin alone. <b>It will no longer give you.</b> The land would now yield even less than after Adam’s sin",

        "1_, 3_Chapter, 25_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>Then men began (<i>huchal</i>).</b> Some render this, “Then they desecrated.” At that time people began calling the astronomical bodies by Hashem’s name, believing them to be intermediaries between Him and His creatures. This was the beginning of idolatry.",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 4_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Adonoy saw.</b> Hashem created the world to be totally, or at least mostly, good; therefore as soon as evil predominates, it loses its right to exist.",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 6_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>From man to beast.</b> The beasts were only created for the sake of human beings; therefore if the latter were to be destroyed there would be no purpose in the former. Moreover, it would have required a special miracle to save the animals from the flood and outside of the human realm Providence only looks after species, not individuals.",
        "1_, 5_Chapter, 9_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Noach fathered.</b> Noach’s sons are mentioned again here to indicate that in addition to serving Hashem himself, he taught his children to do likewise.",
        "1_, 6_Chapter, 12_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>On that very day.</b> Earlier (v. 7:1) it is implied that Noach entered the ark at the beginning of the seven days, yet here it is implied that he entered only at the end. The resolution is that during these days they could enter and exit freely. Then on the seventh day they entered and remained there.",

        "1_, 6_Chapter, 20_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Every man.</b> That is, not only the beasts but even human beings with their great cunning could not save themselves. The word “every” is meant to include even the giants in their mountain holdouts.",
        "1_, 6_Chapter, 22_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>They were obliterated.</b> The word “obliterated” is repeated to indicate that no sign of them remained. According to the Sages the first indicates obliteration in this world while the second indicates obliteration in the next world.",
        "1_, 7_Chapter, 12_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>[Began] to dry.</b> It was still like mud, dry on the surface but soft underneath. Noach knew that Hashem would tell them when it was safe to go out.",
        "1_, 7_Chapter, 17_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>His sons, his wife and son’s wives.</b> The women are mentioned separately because they were afraid to go out until the men did so.",
        "1_, 8_Chapter, 11_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>This is the sign.</b> Hashem repeated this promise several times so that Noach would be utterly assured. According to the <i>Midrash</i> only the first mention of the word “covenant” in this passage is needed contextually; the other six are to correspond to the six days of creation.",
        "1_, 8_Chapter, 21_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Cham the father of Canaan.</b> Failing to cover his father’s shame and speaking of it mirthfully to his brothers were Canaan-like acts, through which he showed that he was indeed his spiritual forebear.",

        "1_, 10_Chapter, 4_Verse, 3_Comment": "<b>The sons of man. </b> They are called this to emphasize the baseness they displayed in following their own desires rather than their Creator’s will — Hashem wanted them to settle the entire earth yet they chose to remain in one place.",
        "1_, 10_Chapter, 7_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>Ad-noy scattered them.</b> He scattered them by jumbling their language. Once they could no longer communicate they could no longer work together and the speakers of the various languages went to settle in different places. In this way the entire planet became populated. Nevertheless, most of them settled in the north because of the temperate climate.",
        "1_, 10_Chapter, 30_Verse, 3_Comment": "<b>The wife of his son Avram.</b> This seemingly superfluous phrase indicates that Sarai was indeed Avram’s soul-mate and that she left Ur Kasdim not under compulsion but to do Hashem’s will.",
        "1_, 10_Chapter, 31_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>Terach died in Charan.</b> The Torah emphasizes this to teach that Terach abandoned idolatry and his home in Ur Kasdim only out of love of his son, not because he had really changed his beliefs. Avraham may have succeeded in persuading him to observe the rest of the Noachide laws, but idol worship was too deeply ingrained in those generations to be easily uprooted.",
        "1_, 11_Chapter, 0_Verse, 2_Comment": "<b>Go from your land.</b> God withheld his destination from him so that Avraham’s love for Him would be made known. It is difficult to abandon one’s home, one’s birthplace and one’s family to move to an unfamiliar land. Moreover, God did not even promise that it would be a goodly land. Nevertheless, Avraham accepted the command with love.",
        "1_, 11_Chapter, 3_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>As Ad-noy had told him.</b> He did not ask questions but had faith that God would fulfill His promises.",

        "1_, 12_Chapter, 15_Verse, 0_Comment": "<b>As the dust of the earth.</b> On the simple level this is an exaggeration.

        "1_, 15_Chapter, 5_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>Sarai dealt harshly.</b> She assigned her difficult tasks and perhaps even beat her. It is clear from God’s blessing to Hagar (v. 11) that He was not pleased with Sarah’s conduct.

        "1_, 18_Chapter, 30_Verse, 1_Comment": "<b>There is no man on earth.</b> It is unlikely that they thought the world had been destroyed because when they left Zoar it was still intact.
