That is to say, it will not be called by any name other than that original name which it had from the day that Avraham bound Yitzchak there. The name he called it was Yireh (will see), and its name before was Shalem, which together are Jerusalem (Yerushalayim). One could also explain it ‘the name of the city in the future from the day of its rebuilding and on’ they will call her The Lord is There:"
