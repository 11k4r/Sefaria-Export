        "12_Chapter, 16_Verse": "<b>Should they encounter war.</b> That is, when they saw the corpses of their brothers who were slain in battle. This refers to the two hundred thousand men of Ephraim who had left Egypt thirty years earlier and had gone to Philistia. Because they violated the Divine decree by leaving before the appointed time, they were delivered into the hands of the Philistines. These were the dry bones that were later revived by the prophet Yechezkel.",
        "13_Chapter, 14_Verse": "<b>Why do you (i.e. Moshe) cry to Me?</b> After all, the prayers of My people Yisrael have already preceded yours!",
        "20_Chapter, 11_Verse": "<b>He shall be put to death.</b> By the sword.",
        "27_Chapter, 14_Verse": "<b>A breastplate of judgment.</b> The breastplate served a number of functions: It revealed the correct rulings in difficult court cases, it revealed the strategy to be used in battle and it atoned for errors in judgment.",
        "28_Chapter, 36_Verse": "<b>Anything that touches the altar.</b> Or, “Any<i>one</i> who touches.” Nevertheless, this refers only to the sons of Aharon because anyone else would have been consumed by fire.",
        "31_Chapter, 2_Verse": "<b>Which were on their ears.</b> On <i>their</i> ears and not on the ears of their wives as Aharon had requested. This indicates that the women refused to give their jewelry to the men."
