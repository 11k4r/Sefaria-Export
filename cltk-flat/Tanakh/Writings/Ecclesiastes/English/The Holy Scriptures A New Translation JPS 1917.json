        "4_Chapter, 18_Verse": "For let him remember the days of his life that they are not many; for God answereth him in the joy of his heart.",
        "5_Chapter, 0_Verse": "There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:",
        "5_Chapter, 1_Verse": "a man to whom God giveth riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.",
        "5_Chapter, 2_Verse": "If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul have not enough of good, and moreover he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he;",
        "5_Chapter, 3_Verse": "for it cometh in vanity, and departeth in darkness, and the name thereof is covered with darkness;",
        "5_Chapter, 4_Verse": "moreover it hath not seen the sun nor known it; this hath gratification rather than the other;",
        "5_Chapter, 5_Verse": "yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, and enjoy no good; do not all go to one place?",
        "5_Chapter, 6_Verse": "All the labour of man is for his mouth, And yet the appetite is not filled.",
        "5_Chapter, 7_Verse": "For what advantage hath the wise more than the fool? or the poor man that hath understanding, in walking before the living?",

        "5_Chapter, 10_Verse": "Seeing there are many words that increase vanity, what is man the better?",
        "5_Chapter, 11_Verse": "For who knoweth what is good for man in his life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?",

        "6_Chapter, 4_Verse": "It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, Than for a man to hear the song of fools.",
        "6_Chapter, 5_Verse": "For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool; this also is vanity.",
        "6_Chapter, 6_Verse": "Surely oppression turneth a wise man into a fool; And a gift destroyeth the understanding.",
        "6_Chapter, 7_Verse": "Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.",

        "6_Chapter, 9_Verse": "Say not thou: ‘How was it that the former days were better than these?’ for it is not out of wisdom that thou inquirest concerning this.",
        "6_Chapter, 10_Verse": "Wisdom is good with an inheritance, Yea, a profit to them that see the sun.",
        "6_Chapter, 11_Verse": "For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.",
        "6_Chapter, 12_Verse": "Consider the work of God; for who can make that straight, which He hath made crooked?",
        "6_Chapter, 13_Verse": "In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; God hath made even the one as well as the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.",
        "6_Chapter, 14_Verse": "All things have I seen in the days of my vanity; there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing.",
        "6_Chapter, 15_Verse": "Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise; why shouldest thou destroy thyself?",
        "6_Chapter, 16_Verse": "Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish; why shouldest thou die before thy time?",
        "6_Chapter, 17_Verse": "It is good that thou shouldest take hold of the one; yea, also from the other withdraw not thy hand; for he that feareth God shall discharge himself of them all.",
        "6_Chapter, 18_Verse": "Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man more than ten rulers that are in a city.",
        "6_Chapter, 19_Verse": "For there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.",
        "6_Chapter, 20_Verse": "Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee;",
        "6_Chapter, 21_Verse": "for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.",
        "6_Chapter, 22_Verse": "All this have I tried by wisdom; I said: ‘I will get wisdom’; but it was far from me.",
        "6_Chapter, 23_Verse": "That which is is far off, and exceeding deep; who can find it out?",
        "6_Chapter, 24_Verse": "I turned about, and applied my heart to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know wickedness to be folly, and foolishness to be madness;",
        "6_Chapter, 25_Verse": "and I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands; whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.",
        "6_Chapter, 26_Verse": "Behold, this have I found, saith Koheleth, adding one thing to another, to find out the account;",
        "6_Chapter, 27_Verse": "which yet my soul sought, but I found not; one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.",

        "7_Chapter, 3_Verse": "Forasmuch as the king’s word hath power; and who may say unto him: ‘What doest thou?’",
        "7_Chapter, 4_Verse": "Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; And a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment.",
        "7_Chapter, 5_Verse": "For to every matter there is a time and judgment; for the evil of man is great upon him.",
        "7_Chapter, 6_Verse": "For he knoweth not that which shall be; for even when it cometh to pass, who shall declare it unto him?",
        "7_Chapter, 7_Verse": "There is no man that hath power over the wind to retain the wind; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.",
        "7_Chapter, 8_Verse": "All this have I seen, even applied my heart thereto, whatever the work that is done under the sun; what time one man had power over another to his hurt.",
        "7_Chapter, 9_Verse": "And so I saw the wicked buried, and they entered into their rest; but they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city; this also is vanity.",
        "7_Chapter, 10_Verse": "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil;",
        "7_Chapter, 11_Verse": "because a sinner doeth evil a hundred times, and prolongeth his days—though yet I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, that fear before Him;",
        "7_Chapter, 12_Verse": "but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he feareth not before God.",
        "7_Chapter, 13_Verse": "There is a vanity which is done upon the earth: that there are righteous men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous—I said that this also is vanity.",
        "7_Chapter, 14_Verse": "So I commended mirth, that a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry, and that this should accompany him in his labour all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.",
        "7_Chapter, 15_Verse": "When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth—for neither day nor night do men see sleep with their eyes—",
        "7_Chapter, 16_Verse": "then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun; because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.",
        "8_Chapter, 0_Verse": "For all this I laid to my heart, even to make clear all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God; whether it be love or hatred, man knoweth it not; all is before them.",
