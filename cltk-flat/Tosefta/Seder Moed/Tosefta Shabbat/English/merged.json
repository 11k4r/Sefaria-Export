Therefore, when there is danger to life, no precept is to be insisted on except those prohibiting idolatry, unchastity, and murder.  When does the rule apply?  Not in a time of religious persecution.  But during a time of religious persecution, a man must be willing to give up his life even for the least demanding of precepts, as it is said, \"You shall not profane My Holy Name - I am to be hallowed among the children of Israel\" (Lev. 22:32).",
