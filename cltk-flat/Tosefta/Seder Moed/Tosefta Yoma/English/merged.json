The explanation of Rabbi Yehuda Ben Betira is that he may be with his wife, and there is a doubt as to whether she is a Niddah and he would become impure in the seven days before Yom Kippur. There was another reading that he was taken to Lishkat Barvatan.",

In the beginning the ark was placed on it. Once the ark was taken away they would burn the incense which was offered in the inner chamber upon it. R’ Yose said that from it the world was founded as it says, “From Tzion, the perfection of beauty…appeared.” (Tehillim 50:2)"
