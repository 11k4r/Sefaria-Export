        "2_Chapter, 1_Tosefta": "... The people of Sodom became haughty in front of the Place only due to the goodness He showered upon them, as it says : \"A land from which bread had issued forth — its place was overturned, as if (consumed by) fire. A place of sapphire were its stones, and dusts of gold were there. (And now it is) a path unknown (i.e., unfrequented) by brigands, and unseen by the falcon's eye, untrodden by the haughty (beasts) and not crossed by the lion (Job 28:5-8). The people of Sodom [said]: \"Since food comes out of our land, and silver and gold, and precious stones and pearls [all come] from our land, we have no need that other people will come to us to diminish [our valuables]. Let us rise and prevent the wayfarers to enter our cities [banot]!\" The Holy One of Blessing said to them: \"I gave goodness to you, and you seek to forget the wayfarers from your cities?! I will forget the wayfarers in your midst [beinechem] and I will forget you from the world!\" What does it say? \"He breaks open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot that pass by; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.\" (Job 28:4) and \"The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure, in whatsoever God brings into their hand.\" (Job 12:6) and so it says \"As I live—declares the Lord GOD—your sister Sodom and her daughters did not do what you and your daughters did.Only this was the sin of your sister Sodom: arrogance! She and her daughters had plenty of bread\"(Ezekiel 16:48-49)",
        "3_Chapter, 2_Tosefta": "How did Moses know where Joseph had been buried? They said: Serakh daughter, of Asher was of the same generation, and she went and said to Moses: \"In the Nile River, Joseph is buried. And the Egyptians made for him metal skewers and affixed them with wood.\" Moses went and stood at the Nile River and said, \"Joseph, the time has come for the Holy Blessed One to redeem Israel. Behold, the Shekhina is delayed for you, and the Israelites are delayed for you, and the clouds of glory are delayed for you. If you reveal yourself, good (okay!), and if not, we are cleansed of the oath which you have sworn upon our fathers.\" Then the coffin of Joseph floated to the surface and Moses took hold of it and went.",
        "4_Chapter, 4_Tosefta": "Rabbi Meir would say: Just as there are different attitudes in consumption of food, so are there different attitudes with regards to women. Some men, if a fly [merely] passes over his cup, he sets it aside and does not taste it. That [fly in the cup refers to] corrupted women, when he wishes to divorce his wife [but has not done it yet]. Some men, if a fly falls into his cup, he throws it out and does not drink it. And this is the trait of Papus ben Yehuda, who would lock [the door of the house] before his wife, and would leave. And there is a man where, if a fly falls in his cup, he throws [the fly] out and then drinks it. This is the trait of any man who sees her speak to her neighbors and relatives, and leaves her be. And there is a man where, if a fly falls into the plate, he crushes it and eats it. And this is the trait of a corrupted man who sees his wife go out with her head uncovered, her heart warmed for her servants and maidservants, and spins cloth in the marketplace, and [whose shirt is] open on both sides, and bathes and plays around with the men. This is the command from the Torah to divorce her, for it is stated [Deuteronomy 24:1-2] \"[When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass, if she find no favor in his eyes,] because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, [that he writes her a bill of divorce, and gives it in her hand,] and sends her out of his house... [and she departs out of his house, and goes and becomes another man's wife.]\" The text calls him 'another', implying that he is not of similar constitution to the first, [for] the first one sent her away because of sin, and the second came and was lenient toward her. If he merits, the heavens will cause him to send her away from his possession, and if not, she will ultimately bury him, as it says [Deuteronomy 24:2] \"or if the latter man dies.\" It is appropriate for this [type of] man dies, because of the woman he brought into his household. One who wishes his wife to die [so he can] inherit her, or that she should die so he can marry her sister, she will ultimately bury him. Similarly, if she wishes he would die so she can marry another, he will bury her.",
        "5_Chapter, 1_Tosefta": "...Drashed Rabbi Akiva: At the time that Israel went up from the sea, they wanted to sing, and the Divine Spirit came to them and they sang.How?   They sang it like the Hallel HaGadol (Psalm 136) is sung in synagogues- the leader sings, and everyone else responds.  Moshe said \"I will sing to Adonai!\", and Israel responded \"I will sing to Adonai!\".  Moses said \"God is my strength and my salvation!\" and Israel responded, \"I will sing to Adonai!\".  Moses said \"Adonai is a Warrior!\" and Israel said \"I will sing to Adonai!\".   Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosi HaGalili said: It's like a kid who reads the Hallel in a school- the leader says it, and the child responds afterwards with each and every word.  Moses said, \"I will sing to Adonai!\", and Israel said \"I will sing to Adonai!\".   Moses said \"God is my strength and my salvation!\" and Israel responded, \"God is my strength and my salvation!\", etc.   Rabbi Nechemiah said: It was like the way people read Sh'ma in synagogues, as it says, \"Thus sang Moshe and the Children of Israel, etc.\"- [It was that] Moshe opened with a phrase, and Israel answered after him and completed it with him.  Moshe said \"Thus sang...\" and Israel responded \"I will sing to Adonai, for God has triumphed gloriously!\".  Moshe said \"God is my strength and my salvation\" and Israel responded \"This is my God, Whom I will glorify!\" Moshe said, \"Adonai is a Warrior!\" and Israel said \"Adonai is God's Name!\" etc. ",

        "6_Chapter, 6_Tosefta": "...Another interpretation (Ecclesiastes 12:11) \"The sayings of the wise are like goads, like nails fixed in prodding sticks. They were given by one Shepherd.\" Just as the goad directs the cow so as to bring life to the world, so too words of Torah are only life for the world, as it is said, “It is a tree of life . . .” [Proverbs 3:18]. Or, just as the goad is movable, might it be so for words of Torah? Scripture says, “And like nails firmly planted.” [Or, might (words of Torah like nails) neither diminish nor increase? Scripture says, “firmly planted.”] Just as a plant flourishes and grows, so too words of Torah flourish and grow. 'Masters of Assemblies' these are students of the wise that enter into multiple assemblies and declare what is impure [to be] impure, and what is pure [to be] pure; what is impure [to be] in its place and what is pure [to be] in its place. Perhaps it will arise in one's mind that since Beit Shammai [declares] impure and Beit Hillel [declares] pure, so-and-so prohibits and so-and-so permits, [Why] should I henceforth study Torah? Scripture teaches \"words\" \"the words\" \"these are the words\" [see Exodus 19:6-7] all of these words were given by \"one Shepherd\" [Ecclesiastes 12:11]. One God created them, one Benefactor gave them, the Master of all deeds, blessed be He, said them. Now make for your heart chambers within chambers and bring into it the words of Beit Shammai and the words of Beit Hillel, the words of those who declare impure and the words of those who declare pure.

        "10_Chapter, 6_Tosefta": "\"As for the matter you mentioned (1 Samuel 10:2), 'When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin.' But haven't we learned that Rachel was buried in Bethlehem (her portion) of Judah, as it says (Genesis 35:19), 'Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).' And Ephrath is none other than Judah's portion, as it says (Micah 5:1), 'But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah...' Rather, Samuel told Saul, 'Now that I am speaking to you, you will go and find them near Rachel's tomb, and they will tell you that she is buried on the border of Benjamin, at Zelzah.' Similarly, it says (1 Samuel 22:6), 'Now Saul was sitting under a tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with his spear in his hand, and all his officials were standing around him.' If Saul was in Gibeah, then how could he be in Ramah, and if he was in Ramah, how could he be in Gibeah? Rather, it was the court of Samuel the Ramathite that made Saul's throne stable in Gibeah. Similarly, it says (Psalm 122:2), 'Our feet are standing in your gates, Jerusalem.' Can it really be said that our feet are only standing in the gates of Jerusalem? Rather, it is the courts of David that stand in the gates of Jerusalem. Similarly, it says (Zechariah 14:10), 'The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah.' But wasn't the area south of Jerusalem already a plain, and Geba and Rimmon hilly regions? Rather, just as Geba and Rimmon are destined to become a plain opposite Jerusalem, so too all lands are destined to become a plain opposite Jerusalem.\"",
        "12_Chapter, 7_Tosefta": "The year in which Shimon the Righteous died [he said to them] \"in this year I will die\" \"how do you know this?\" they responded. He (Shimon the Righteous) responded: \"all of the Yom Kippur days there was an old man dressed in all white who would go with me into the holy of holies and leave with me, on this year he went in with me but did not come out with me.\" Seven days passed after the holiday and he died. From the time of the death of Rebbi Shimon the Righteous they ceased blessing in the name of Hashem.",
        "14_Chapter, 4_Tosefta": "Rabbi Ishmael said: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, it would be appropriate that we not eat meat or drink wine (since these were used in the Temple service).  But a court does not decree (restrictions) on the community which they cannot uphold.  He would say that since they (the Romans) decree upon us that we not learn Torah, we should decree upon the community that they not marry women (since they do not know marriage and family laws), and not have children - and as a consequence, the seed of Abraham will cease.  Rather, leave Israel alone (to continue to do as they now do, marrying and having families); it is better that (if they transgress), they do so inadvertently and not intentionally."
