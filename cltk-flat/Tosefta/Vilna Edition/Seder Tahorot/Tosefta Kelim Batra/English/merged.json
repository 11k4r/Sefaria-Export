        "2_Chapter, 3_Tosefta": "Rabbi Yosei says [that vessels must have an outer side, an inner side, and a handle] \"with respect to [ritually] pure hands\" (Kel. 25:7-8).  <i>How so?</i> If his hands were pure and liquid was still moist on them, and the back of the cup was impure, he may hold it by its handle, and he need not be concerned lest the liquid [that remains] on his hands become impure due to the cup, and his hands once again contract impurity. Rabbi Tarfon says, [this rule only applies] to a large wooden trough, [which must] have a handle on it. "
