This (meanness) comes from a certain level of denial (of G-d) because if a man considers that everything comes from G-d, he will not be jealous of anything that belongs to his friend.  If G-d gave his friend something, it is definitely proper that he should have it.  If on the other hand he doesn't think that, and that really he should have what his friend possesses he denies the lot that G-d has given him.  this is the meaning of a 'good eye'."
