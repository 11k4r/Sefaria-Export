                "0": "THESE ARE THE MATTERS WITH WHICH A PERSON SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF AND LIVE BY THEM, Every moment when one is free from Torah study, specifically when one is sitting idly alone in his room or lying on his bed and is unable to sleep, he should think of the Mitzva \"And they shall be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel\" and place on his soul and picture in his mind as if there were a great awesome fire burning before him to the heart of the heavens, and for the sanctifying of the AlMighty's blessed name that he break his nature and cast himself into the fire for sanctifying His (G-d's) blessed name. And this good thought G-d will consider as if he actually did so. Thus, it is found that one is not sitting or lying idly rather he is fulfilling a positive Torah commandment. ",
                "1": "During the first verse of reciting the Shema prayer and the first blessing of the Amidah one should think in the same manner. And further imagine if all the nations of the world would afflict you with all severe afflictions and flay his skin from his flesh so that he can deny, heaven forbid, His (G-d's) oneness, he should bear all the suffering and not admit to them such, heaven forbid. And he should picture on his mind and thoughts as if they were doing such to him, and with this one will fulfill his obligation of reciting the Shema and Amidah properly.",
                "2": "Also when eating and cohabiting one should think similarly. When he begins to feel physical pleasure he should imagine in his mind such and immediately say verbally and in his  heart that the pleasure and joy of preforming the Mitzva of \"and I shall be sanctified\" in the manner prescribed above is greater than that physical pleasure which out of suffering of separation it urges. So shall he say, and a prove the matter that the pleasure and happiness of doing the positive commandment of \"And they shall be sanctified\" above, that even if he were to be beaten by murders in the middle of eating and cohabitation and afflict him with harsh suffering, 'I would make myself rejoice regarding the sanctification of G-d's name more than this pleasure. However he should be careful to say this truthfully in his heart so  that the matter would then be ingrained on his heart in essence and substance in total truth, and not make oneself foolish to try to fool the knowledge of the one above, Heaven forbid. ",
                "3": "With everything in the world, be that with Torah, Prayer and Mitzva performance, one should accustom oneself to say the following: \"Behold I am doing for the sake of the uniting with the Holy One and His divine presence to cause a pleasing spirit for the Holy One, may His name be blessed\".  And accustom oneself to say this with the essence and substance of the heart, and with the passing of time one with feel great influence (of the Divine presence) with saying this. ",
                "4": "When one begins to feel temptation from one of his bad traits which he is accustomed to, for example: stubbornness, haughtiness, laziness, idleness that bring one to foolishness and the like, he should say the following verse with all his might: \"The Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Prizite, the Jebusite,  and the Girgashite,\" and he will be saved. One should also accustom oneself to not look out side of his four cubit personal space even when he is at home, and specifically when he his in the (Torah) study hall and/or the room which he studies (Torah). If when he is walking and outside and sees before him a woman, even a woman and her children, he should have before his eyes the name of G-d",
                "5": "If, G-d forbid the evil thought of lust comes to ones mind, he should say several times \"And you shall be guarded from all evil,\" and think then about the exegesis of our sages, of blessed memory that one should not think lustful thoughts in the day and come to night emissions, and not allow, G-d forbid, to keep this bad thought in ones mind  so as not to defile the divine intelligence (within him) , G-d forbid. ",
                "6": "Were there to be before one, heaven forbid, a improper sight, for example: wild, domestic animals or birds mating, or an uncovered hand-breadth's part of a woman's nakedness or the image of one's wife when she is menstruating or in similar circumstances; One should say immediately the verse \"Do not stray after your heart [and after your eyes]\", and not defile his mind, Heaven forbid.  ",
                "7": "One should accustom himself to not begin to speak with any person except for a great reason which he is forced to do so; and even in forced circumstances he should speak should speak very shortly \"sifted with 13 sieves\"  so that his words do not contain any falsehood- heaven forbid- or any flattery, gossip, slander, shaming, or exposing of one's actions to others. And he should accustom himself with the rule that our sages of blessed memory said, \"teach your tongue to say 'I do not know' \". When people who are not careful from speaking needlessly come to speak to him- he should remove himself from them with all his strength and with all types of strategies. And when it is not possible to leave them in any manner, never the less he should extremely limit (his speech) to that which he is forced to answer them. ",
                "8": "One should accustom oneself, immediately right when waking up from one's slumber to say, \"I acknowledge before you (Modeh Ani), the Living Extant King, that you have given me back my soul compassionately. Your faith is abundant.\" And say, even if in the Ashkenazic language, with a joyous heart: \"Blessed is the Most High God who gave me the commandment of the tzitzit I am wrapped in, and the commandment of washing hands in the morning, to remove the evil spirit and harsh klipah from my two hands.\" Be sure that one's heart is full of joy when saying this, and accept up oneself the restriction of limiting speech which was mentioned in section 8. ",
                "9": "One should be very careful with consistency of studying the lessons in their proper order, immediately right after waking from slumber, and after saying Tikkun Chatzot and the Tzetel Katan. One should not leave the book one is studying even for one hour. Every time that one is settling down to study, and after saying the Prayer of Repentence which begins \"Ana Hashem etc.\" and the Prayer for Torah Study from the Shaarei Tzion which starts \"Hineni Rotzeh Lilmod,\" one should be as sure as possible not to cause any delay, even with an unrelated thought, apart from the thoughts of study, and the thoughts of the Tzetel Katan which is before one's eyes, because the light in it brings one back to the good. ",
                "10": "One should accustom oneself to pray with full strength, and with a voice that arouses the intention to attach thought to speech, and with one's face toward the wall inside the Siddur, both morning and evening. One should not look to the side from the beginning of prayer to the end, and during the Chazan's repetition one should attend to the Siddur, to answer \"Amen\" with full strength to every single blessing. And during the Torah reading, one should listen for every single statement from the reader, similar to Megillah reading. One should act like a mute person in the synagogue, even before or after the prayer, until leaving to go home. ",
                "11": "One should constantly picture in the mind, and especially while reading this Tzetel Katan, that someone is standing close by and encouraging one with a in a loud voice to uphold all these practices, and should not allow any one of these practices to drop, even down to a tiny dot. And when one accustoms oneself in this way, then over time, a great enthusiasm will come over one, from the part of one's soul: fiery coals of God's flame. ",
                "12": "At all times, one should tell someone who is showing them God's way, or even a trusted friend, all the bad thoughts and fantasies that are in opposition to our holy Torah, which the Evil Inclination raises in one's mind and heart, whether during times of Torah and prayer, whether when one is lying in bed, or whether in the middle of the day. One should not leave anything out due to shame. It will occur that through discussing these things, by bringing it from force to action, one breaks the force of the Evil Inclination, so it will not be able to overpower one the next time. Besides, there might be good advice that one can receive from a friend which is God's way, and this is a wonderful segulah. ",
                "13": "One must be very, very careful to return periodically to this Tzetel Katan, and parse out every letter in the Ashkenazic language. And this should be one's rule, not to be violated: before sex, one should study Chapter 16 of Reishit Chochma, and the teachings of the Ariza\"l, and if one still has time, one should also study Chapter 17 of the Reishit Chochma mentioned above, and this should be one's rule, not to be violated.",
                "14": "Before washing one's hands to eat, one should say the Prayer of Repentance of Rabbeinu Yona z\"l, and after eating [a small bite for] Hamotzi, one should say these words, \"For the sake of unifying the Holy Blessed One and His Shechina, I am not eating for physical pleasure, Heaven forbid, but only so that my body will be healthy and strong to serve Him whose Name is blessed, and no sins or violations or evil fantasies or physical pleasure should prevent the unification of the Holy Blessed One through the holy sparks of this eating and drinking.\" And one should intend while eating something or drinking something, that the flavor that one tastes in the mouth while chewing and swallowing, is the holy inner essence and holy sparks that dwell in this food or drink. And through eating, and grinding with teeth and digestion, the inner essence of the the food is purified, which is not unbound/permitted to influence the outer portion, and then one's soul will enjoy the inner essence, while the trash is unbound and and ejected to the outer portion. And one should accept then mentally that immediately when one feels the urge to eliminate wastes, one will not delay that trash inside one's body, contaminating, Heaven forbid, one's mind, fouling one's soul, by delaying with feces or urine inside one's innards for even one moment. One should also picture before one while eating and drinking the letters \"Mem-Aleph-Kaf-Lamed\" (=\"Food\") written in Assyrian script, and should ponder the fact that they add up to 91, the same sum as the Tetragrammaton when combined with \"Adonai.\"",
                "15": "Man was only created in the world in order to break Nature. For this reason, one must encourage oneself to fix one's middot, specifically in the eighteenth year, as I will explain. For example, if someone was born with a stubborn nature, they should break their nature by doing for forty consecutive days exactly the opposite of what their mind thinks of doing. And similarly if someone is naturally lazy, they should accustom themselves for forty consecutive days to do everything enthusiastically, from going to lie down in bed to waking up in the morning, to enthusiasm in getting dressed, washing their hands, cleaning their body, walking enthusiastically to synagogue immediately after finishing one's study, and the like. And similarly, someone who is shy by nature, and it's the bad kind of shyness, should accustom themselves for forty days to pray specifically with a loud voice, with forceful movements of their limbs, and to obey \"all my bones say...\" (=to sway during prayer), and to say Torah blessings with a loud voice, until They help them from Heaven by removing the bad shyness from them. And similarly someone whose words do not come out nice and organized, due to their habitual nature and their speech organs, should accustom themselves for forty days to pay attention to the words they say, whether in general speech,  in sacred speech, or while studying, because in every situation, habit becomes the boss. And similarly someone who naturally does not pay attention to their studies, should accustom themselves also for forty days, and study more than one usually does, and should look each time before studying at my Tzetel Katan. And from then on, They will help them from Heaven to add and continue breaking their bad middot until they are completely gone. ",
                "16": "At all times, when one is free from Torah or prayer, one should teach oneself things one needs to know by heart, like Tikkun Rachel and Tikkun Leah, and the Prayer of Repentance and the Blessing for the New Moon and \"Berich Shmei\" and \"Al Hakol\" and the Modim of the Rabbis, and one should contemplate the positive commandment of \"And I will be sanctified etc.\" as written above.

                    "0": "In a beginning created God etc - see the explanation of Rashi \"in a beginning - due to Israel that are called beginning, and due to Torah that is called beginning\" and the midrash, too, has \"due to the mitzvah of first fruits, that are called beginning\" (Rashi on Genesis 1:1). And one could say that all those opinions have the same intention, that one opinion says this, the other opinion says that, and they do not dispute. ",
                    "1": "Since there is in the mishnah \"on three things the world stands on Torah, and on Service and on Acts of Loving Kindness\" (Avot 1:2) and there is in the mishnah \"on three things the world stands, on Judgment, and on Truth and on Peace\" (Avot 1:18). And we can also say that they have the same intention, that behold we are presented with three levels in the service of the High Creator, one - Torah learned for its own sake, and in truth our sages of blessed memory allowed us [study of Torah] even not for its own sake, as they said \"a person should always engage etc\" even if one does not reach to the levels of learning for its own sake nevertheless you should not refrain from it, since it is not quickly that one attains to learn for its own sake, but through a great exertion in one's service to the Blessed Name with all the good personal qualities. ",
                    "2": "And the second level \"Service\" - this is the Prayer that is the center of the service of the heart as they said \"and to serve God with all your heart, this is Prayer [Tefilah]\" (Taanit 2a), because the heart understands and with [Prayer] it can rise to clinging to the Creator and tie itself to the Blessed One, since Tefilah comes from the expression knot/connection, to cling oneself to the Blessed Creator with a great clinging, and this hints to the knot of the tefilin of the hand to tie the thought in one's heart to the High One, and for that one needs more effort to always pray to the Holy Blessed Name that God will help that one's yetzer hara [inclination for evil] will never be separated from clinging to the Creator, because the nature of a person is that one is likely to turn [at any moment] his thoughts to the issues and preoccupations of this world.",
                    "3": "And this is the explanation of the verse \"And Hashem saw that the evil of the humans on earth was great\" (Genesis 6:5), that is to say, at all times that one is on earth and one's evil is great, [\"and all the humans' impulse of thought in their heart\"] through that, also the one who wants to serve the Holy Blessed Name and does not do evil, even though one's thought reins that person in \"only evil all day\", \"and Hashem nacham [had pity/regretted/consoled]\" meaning, there was a consolation for the Blessed One in that a human could exert effort in front of the Blessed One, \"that he made the humans\", meaning, like the saying of our sages of blessed memory: \"were it not for three verses etc \" (Sukkah 52b and Berakhot 31a) and one of them is \"that I made evil\" (Micah 4:6) their hearts - that I gave them the impulse to evil. \"And God was sad in his heart\" - meaning, that the Holy Blessed name was sad due to the heart of the human, that God had given the human a heart of stone like that. \"And Noach found favor\" (Genesis 6:8) - meaning, that Noach was a tzadik and switched himself from the nature that makes humans likely to separate themselves from clinging to the Exalted Creator and strengthen oneself to cling to the Creator, and so [Noach] found favor, Noach with switching the letters becomes Chen, favor, which is him becoming favor in the Blessed Name's eyes.",
                    "4": "The third level \"acts of lovingkindness\" - that behold in the upper worlds God set 'Compassion', which is love and 'beloved' that is the the Holy Blessed Name loves the righteous because of the righteous' holy deeds on the earth, yet in this world they are called 'lovingkindness', that even for a person who is not decent, the Holy Blessed Name does lovingkindness freely, providing for that person's needs. Nevertheless, the righteous who attain the level of rising up every physical thing, which is rising the holy sparks that exist in corporeality, which is in one's eating and drinking and so on, and all one's thoughts in the time of doing physical things are only to rise the holy sparks in them, and a righteous person such as this one does not need lovingkindness, meaning, free lovingkindness as explained above, giving the things needed in this world from the side of lovingkindness, because the Holy Blessed Name showers [the righteous] with their needs according to the deserved letter of the law because of their good deeds. And this is the explanation for \"deeds of lovingkindness [roots g.m.l./kh.s.d.]\": from the expression \"the weaning [g.m.l.] of Yitzchak\" (Genesis 21:8) - there is no need for the levels \"lovingkindness\" [kh.s.d.] just what is deserving to the righteous through the love of the Blessed God for the righteous, and through that the righteous connects him/herself above above to the eternal life, even while in this world the righteous attains the higher pleasure of the eternal life, and this is the explanation for the gemara \"you will see your world in your lifetime\" (Berakhot 17a), that through one's deeds and movements which are all done in holiness and purity and clinging to God and happiness and love and awe, from that one attains pleasures of the higher worlds in this world. And there is to say that this is also the intention of the verse \"and y'all who cling to Hashem you God are all alive today\" (Deuteronomy 4:4) . Meaning, through clinging that y'all cling to the Blessed Creator y'all will get eternal life, even \"today\", in this world, as explained above.",
                    "5": "And this is also the explanation of the verse \"Moshe commanded [to] us Torah, the legacy of the congregation of Yaakov\" (Deuteronomy 33:4) - it is also a hint to the three levels discussed above. \"Moshe commanded us\" - all of us were commanded to learn God's Torah even if it is not for its own sake, and this is \"to us\", every person according to their own level. Second, \"legacy\", this is the second level discussed above, to raise the holy sparks that are called \"inheritance of the forebears\", as it is known, and the Holy Blessed Name gave us the aspect of this inheritance and legacy to raise up the holy sparks, and this is \"legacy\". And this is the intention of \"maintaining His faith on those that sleep in dust\" (Machzor Vitry, Order of Shacharit 88:15), it wants to say that the holy sparks fell down, and the Holy Blessed Name maintains faith with them, to raise them from dust to holiness. And the third level \"congregation of Yaakov\" is the complete clinging that the righteous have, through which they bring down the flow to all Israel, only good, and behold the righteous congregates the congregations of Yaakov that are collected under the shadow of the righteous' wings to bestow on them.",
                    "6": "And through this the saying of the Gemara \"Satan said 'where is Torah?' the Holy One said 'go to the earth' earth said 'I don't have it, go to the sea' and the sea said 'I don't have it, go to the son of Amram\" (Shabbat 89a) will be explained. One needs to understand: how is it that the Holy One said something that is not [true]? And it seems that behold the Holy One of Blessing said to Satan the Accuser 'go to the earth' because [God is saying that] there is learning of Torah in worldliness and corporeality, that is, Torah not for its own sake, and even that learning is received by Me, and you cannot accuse the children of Israel. And the earth said 'I don't have it' - the explanation is that the essence of the purpose [of studying Torah] does not exist in corporeality, as explained, just 'go to the sea' which is the tzadik who raises the sparks to the Upper Sea for the sake of their raising, the tzadik that get to this level he is the essence of the purpose. And regarding this they said 'all rivers go to the sea' (Ecclesiastes 1:7) meaning rivers/nachalim comes from the expression legacy and inheritance/nachal that is the raising of sparks to the Holy are called 'inheritance' as known, and they go to the sea, \"and the sea said 'I don't have it, go to the son of Amram'\" meaning that there is yet another level higher than this, third, like the level of Moshe our teacher, peace be upon him, that reaches the heights of the clinging to the Creator, Blessed be, in the eternal life. ",
                    "7": "And let us return to the first issue, \"on three things the world stands, on judgment [din]\" (Avot 1:18) - this is Torah, as there is that Torah is also called judgment in whichever way it will be, as explained above [for its own sake or not]. \"And on truth\" - that is the level of Yaakov, that is the average, that is compassion [rachamim], as it is written 'gave truth to Yaakov' (Micah 7:2) that through the raising of the holy sparks one awakens compassion and there is no need for lovingkindness, as explained above. \"And on peace\"- that is clinging to God, that one clings to the Blessed Creator since the name of the Holy Blessed One is Peace (Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Section on Peace 11).",
                    "8": "And through this one understands the holy reading in this parsha, 'and God commanded etc from every tree of the garden you shall surely eat, yet from the tree of good and evil you shall not eat from it, for on the day you eat from it you shall surely die\". There are many specific questions: (a) the doubling of the expression eat, eat; (b) the expression 'from it' is superfluous; (c) the doubling of 'die/die'; (d) what Rashi explained, and this is his language - \"because she added to the commandment she ended diminishing it\" (Rashi on Genesis 3:1) is difficult, since didn't she know that in truth  Hashem had not ever forbidden to touch? Therefore no proof can be brought from touching to eating, because eating was truly the commandment, and it stands.",
                    "9": "And it appears to me that the root of the issue is this, that the Blessed Holy One of Blessing said \"from all the trees of the garden you shall surely eat\" - a hint to Torah, which is the tree of life, \"eat\" is an expression of hidden, the explanation is that this is learning for its own sake which is the root and the essence, as the Blessed Holy One of Blessing warned about, and at any instance, if you have not yet reached [the level of] Torah learning for its own sake, in any instance \"you will eat\", meaning, for your benefit [is] learning not for its own sake, and this is \"you will eat\": be present, and do not depart from My Torah. \"And from the tree of good and bad you shall not eat from it\" specifically, meaning, the physical things are in them - the mixture is also good, which are the holy sparks that are in every physical thing; \"shall not eat from it\", the explanation is that your intention should not be exclusively from the material and physical sides only, rather only from the spiritual side, in which the holy sparks are, from that you shall eat. \"Because from the day you eat from it you shall surely die - mot tamut\" meaning, \"die-mot\" in the next world, the eternal life, and the expression \"die - mot\" is also hidden, a hint to the next world, the eternal life, [and] \"die - tamut\" in this world.",
                    "10": "And behold, Chava heard the two levels, that are the learning of Torah in any way that it is learned as explained above, and also the rising of the sparks, and so she understood immediately that there is another level which is the complete clinging to the Creator, of Blessed Name, and this is what she said \"you shall not eat from it neither shall touch it\" (Genesis 3:3) - meaning, touching in this world, that is pausing clinging [to God] unintentionally you should not do, \"lest you die\" that is, interrupting clinging, since she reasoned that she was also commanded regarding this third level. And in truth, clinging comes directly from the two levels previously mentioned, and she wasn't yet on that level. And the snake that pushed her until she touched it and said \"just as you did not die from this touching\" (Rashi on Genesis 3:4 and Bereshit Rabbah 19:4) - the explanation is that you do not pause clinging through this, \"so too there is no death from eating\" meaning, even if you don't eat with the aforementioned intention, to rise [your] spirituality, \"you will not die\" (Genesis 3:4).",
                    "11": "And this is the explanation for \"In a beginning - due to Torah etc and due to Israel etc\" (Rashi on Genesis 1:1:2) this is a hint to clinging to the Blessed and Elevated Creator, the clinging to the Blessed One through songs and praises, and this is the hint \"Israel\" - \"God is direct / yashar E'l\". \"And due to the first fruits that are called reshit/beginning\" a hint regarding the rising of the holy sparks, as it is said \"the beginning of the first fruits of your soil you shall bring to the house of etc\" (Exodus 23:19), that are the sparks that fell down, \"you shall bring to the house of Hashem\" to rise them from the ashes, as explained. Hashem taught us the true way to serve God, in completeness, in truth and in honesty/innocence, amen, may it be God's will."

And it seems that we should explain Rashi, may his memory be for blessing, that since these things are to expose the Unity of the Holy Blessed Name that God is unique in God's marvels and being the True Creator, that this is the sign and the proof of God's people Israel, the righteous, that the light of their minds and hearts is immense in its levels and good personal characteristics with no limits, that our eyes see [Israel's] level is higher than all of the other nations, and the holy Torah that the good God, in God's mercy, gave to them... those two [Israel and Torah] will testify and justify on most of God's wonders and marvels, that God created the world by Godself, with no help and no aid, through what they say \"three testify on each other's behalf, the Holy One of Blessing, Torah and Israel.\" And this is \"Hear Israel Hashem\" - \"Hear\" hints to Torah, since \"Hear\" is Torah that we heard from the mouth of the Blessed One, and \"Israel\" are testifying about Hashem that God is the Maker and the Creator, and to that since Rashi also in his commentary \"due to Torah and due to Israel\" is saying that those two are proof regarding 'Beginning'/creation.

And so to the opposite, God forbid, if one naughtily follows the ways of one's heart, in strange and disorganized thoughts, then on Shabbat all the thoughts of the days of the week, the extraneous and disgusting thoughts, God forbid, they close the gates of lucid prayers, the prayers of Israel, that is, they stand on the Higher gates and prevent the prayers [from entering] the gate of Israel. And this is what the prophet warned against: \"do not bring out your burdens on the day of Shabbat\", meaning, the strange thoughts that are like an enormous burden and are pass before the person on the day of Shabbat due to the fact that one thought about them in the days of the week and \"passed them through the gates of Jerusalem\", meaning, do not pass these prayers, marred with disgusting strange thoughts through the Higher gates, that they stand on the entrance of the gate and prevent the prayers of Israel to go up through the pathways of the gates.

And here is its explanation, that we in this bitter exile, in which in our pain He is pained (see Isaiah 63:9), and the Shechinah is exiled with us (see Eicha Rabbah 1:32 and Megillah 29a) - the only thing we should worry and complain about is the exile of the Shechinah, and not think at all about our sufferings, but only regarding the suffering and exile of the Shechinah. And if our direction and our suffering were only regarding the suffering of the Shechinah and not on our suffering, obviously we would be redeemed immediately, but we are flesh without the ability to tolerate our pain an grief, and so our days lengthen in this bitter exile due to our many sins, because we partner our suffering with the suffering of the Shechinah, and we worry about our suffering. And if there was one tzaddik like this he would be able to save the entire world from this exile. And this is what Moses our master peace be upon him said \"and since I came to speak in Your name\"(Exodus 5:23) - the explanation is that all my speaking was not only for Your great and holy Name, which is in exile, and not only due to our own exile; and the sign and the proof that the truth is with me, that my intent was not only due to Your holy Name is that I see that Pharaoh has done \"evil to this people\"(Exodus 5:23); that this is the sign to the person who wants to rebuke one's fellow or to say holy words: how does one know that one's intention was only for the sake of Heaven without any other thought or position? If one sees that when one speak in front of people who are not sincere and they get angry over those words, it is obvious that the intention of the words was completely only toward Heaven, and with the Help Of The Highest Name one's words will make a mark - and this is what Moses our Master may peace be upon him said: all my words were not for any other intention but Your Name, truly, and this is the proof - evil came to this people. And since my words were only for the holiness of Your Name, it would have been deserving that Israel be redeemed immediately \"and why saved, You haven't saved (Exodus 5:23)\"? And this is what King David peace be upon him said: \"Return to me the happiness of Your salvation\"(Psalms 51:14) - meaning, redeem us and return us speedily to our land, because all my intention is solely for \"the happiness of Your salvation\", that we should be redeemed quickly for Your salvation, to return Your captivity (Lamentations 2:14) which is the Holy Shechina, and not because of us, but only because of You. And the Name will redeem us speedily, and we will be joyful and be happy in His salvation. Amen."

And it seems that the intention of Rashi with this is that Avraham was the attribute of Love (chesed), Yitzchak the aspect of Strength (gevurah) and Yaakov, Balance (tif'eret) and they influenced one another in their aspects, and if so, how was it applicable that El Shadai was seen to all? Isn't it that holiness (kedushah) comes from above according to a person's level? However, the root of this issue is this: from the side of the Blessed Creator there is no change whatsoever, rather, according to the service done by a person in their level [holiness] continues on them. We find that Avraham continued on himself the attribute of Love, and so Yitzchak in his attribute, and also too Yaakov, but from the side of the Blessed Creator, there is unified unique simplicity, and this is why Rashi z\"l explained \"I appeared to the patriarchs\" meaning, that with regards to the Blessed Creator there is no separation or division between them at all, and everything is one, therefore [God] appeared to them in one aspect, as El Shadai.

For that, the tzaddik needs to bind them to their holy ancestors that are included in the general [frame] of Israel, and then they can be raised through the ancestors, and this is why sometimes it is written \"according to their ancestral houses\" before \"according to their families\", due to the fact that one needs to bind them to their ancestors first, so as to raise them among the rest of the families of Israel, and regarding those who are tzaddikim whose souls come from the Upper Worlds it is switched, that one raises them according to the order of low to high, beginning with their families and afterwards their ancestor houses, to bind them with the level of their ancestors, that too, and if you think about this, it will become clear to you."

This is a hint for a person who would like to acquire a living space for their piece of Above: one needs to fix their actions every 30 days, meaning, direct their thoughts to teshuvah and review [lehader, also praise or embellish] their deeds every 30 days, and this is why the sages have established fasting every erev Rosh Chodesh [day before the beginning of the month] so one could rummage through their deeds, and because of this they hinted that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would review his learning every 30 days.

And it seems that we can explain this by combining the verse \"the One who makes great lights, God's kindness endures forever (Ps. 136:7) - behold, the two lights are Love and Awe, and both of them were great equally, [since there is Awe of Greatness aka fear] and behold, when the moon said \"it is not possible for two kings etc\" the moon wanted to rise above its level, or the sun, and not to descend from that level, God forbid. And the Holy Blessed Name saw that that was impossible, due to the evil ones, who need to feel awe only due to fear of punishment, and said to the moon 'go diminish yourself' - and this is the small awe, which begins with the fear of punishment. And in truth there is the light of the seven days of Creation \"God saw that it was not appropriate, etc, and hid the light for the righteous in the future\". And this is what we say \"forms light and creates darkness\" and yet we should say \"formed light\" in the past and not the present. In truth, however, the Holy One of Blessing creates light continuously due to God's mercy. To the tzadik, who walks in God's ways in truth and completion, the Hidden Light [Or Ganuz] is revealed and is seen and at every day that the tzadik goes to higher levels, the more the light reveals itself to him. And this is \"God saw that it wasn't enough etc and hid the light for the tzadikim in the world to come\" (Bereshit Rabbah 12:6, Chagigah 12a): the future of the tzadikim is to go into this light, the Hidden Light, that is revealed to them. And this is why \"God makes the great lights\" is also written in the present tense. And behold, to feel fear of punishment is possible even if a person has not seen the thing to be afraid of, as just our saying to them \"do not go to such-and-such place, there are bad things there\" and they don't go because they feel fear. But love can't happen without seeing the thing that brings love about, and all the time one does not see the thing with one's eyes one just feels desire to see. Love means unity, and that is why the gematria for 'love' is the same as 'one'. And when a person is on that level, in unity, one needs to guard it always and one needs to strengthen oneself that if that level wasn't reached yet. And we find that the root of love is called \"seeing\", as we explained, since love is not completed without seeing. And this is \"see!\" - meaning, when you are on the level of love, which is called seeing, \"I give to y'all\" - meaning, you need to strengthen yourself that you have not reached that level of unity yet, and you are still on the level of the rest of human beings, since \"today blessing and curse\" - meaning, strengthen yourself as if you began just today to accustom yourself to the levels of Love and Awe. \"Blessing\" is a hint to love, and \"curse\" a hint to Fear, which is the whipping for the wicked (Zohar 1:11b). \"The blessing, that y'all listen etc\" one has to say according to the allegory of a person who has some disease, God forbid, and was healed from it, and at all times the person is noticing and listening to their body to see if the disease is erupting again, God forbid, and so too every person needs to at all times listen to themselves and notice if they have fulfilled their mitzvot for Hashem, if something not good - God forbid! - is erupting, and this is \"the blessing if you listen\": the blessing resides in listening, as explained, that you listen and notice at all times even if you are fulfilling God's mitzvot if there is something lacking on them. \"The curse, if you do not listen\" that is to say, if you don't watch out for yourselves as explained above. That is why a person needs to pay attention always, and watch out for him/herself at every moment, so it will be a blessing for her/him, and for their children. And this is easy to understand.\n"

The explanation is that the way of the righteous is that they have (internally) a rebuker that rebukes them on every action they take, it rebukes them on their faces and shows them that even in their good deeds how they are lacking, and how they did not do them appropriately (lit. according to the halakha) so as to do them for the sake of the Creator Praised Be, and this is \"the impulse to do good rules them\". This is not what happens to the evil ones, to whom all is upside down, since all their deeds are good in their eyes, and even the evil deeds they do the impulse to do evil shows them that they did a good thing, and this is \"the impulse to do evil rules them.\" \"Middling people are ruled by both\", as the tanna says \"like us, middling\". That is, a person needs to strengthen oneself with these two ways, to always dispute internally regarding one's deeds, seeing oneself all the time as lacking in one's work (avodah, also worship) to the Holy One, and that one has not fulfilled one's obligation. As a person does one of the mitzvot of God, one needs to understand and comprehend very well that one did not do it with all the requirements regarding clearness (lucidity) and merit as fitting for Hashem The Praised, and then one will see oneself as humble and despised in one's eyes, and yet one should not, God forbid, hold oneself to be evil, because in that case one won't be able to have heart to do a mitzvah or [study] Torah or pray, and what would this be? A kosher and direct happening? [Of course not] One [in that case] despairs and says that one is not capable to do this. We find that a person needs to strengthen these two levels (intenally) together so they will be perfect within oneself, as the rabbis of blessed memory say \"with all your hearts - with your two inclinations\", and this is \"like us, middling\" and \"middlings are ruled by both.\"",

                    "2": "\"You must not bend etc and not recognize a face\" (Deuteronomy 16:20) because it is written \"you shall not have other gods before Me [lit. in front of My face]\" (Exodus 20:3) and one can explain it like this: behold, the Blessed Creator is called \"face of every thing\", since every thing has a piece of divinity that makes it present and gives it vitality, and if, God forbid, a person thinks a extraneous thought, or looks at something evil, then one turns away and distances one's face from it. And the extraneous thoughts  and the evil sightings and evil passing thoughts are called \"other gods\" and this is \"you shall not have other gods etc\" and this is [also] \"you must not recognize faces\" that is to say, that you will not sin and not think outside thoughts, so that you won't distance the face and become estranged from yourself. \"You shall take no bribe because the bribe blinds the eyes of the wise, etc\" (Deuteronomy 16:20), and at a first glance don't our eyes see many and many receivers of bribe, and they are healthy, and strong, and they die closing their eyes? But the issue is that the righteous person who is dedicated to Hashem in truth merits high levels in the eyes of His intellect, that is, the higher Wisdom, and this is \"the eyes of Hashem are on the righteous\" (Psalms 34:16) that the Holy One of Blessing gives merit to the righteous in the eyes of the Higher Intellect, and this is \"you shall not take etc because the bribe blinds the eyes of the wise etc\", meaning that the person will not merit in the eyes of His intellect in the Higher Wisdom, \"and perverts the words of the righteous\" that is, the righteous that speak in their holiness the receiver of bribes perverts them, that is, not just that that person will not merit Higher Wisdom, but also if the righteous want to negate their words and return that person to the good, their words will not help that person, since all their words will appear to that person as perverted."

And there is the righteous person that also during the days of the week serves G!d out of love, and this righteous one is called with the name Shabbat, as we find in the Holy Zohar “a disciple of the sages is called Shabbat”, that is, Shabbat is the aspect of love, and this righteous person is always at this level, therefore s/he is also called Shabbat.",

And it is important to ask why did G!d chose the crows, which are cruel to their young, to bring bread to him? And according to our previous words “and he sat by Nachal” that he was continuing the Flow from the Higher River, and the ways of the crows, which are the husks (kelipot) is to tear at the flows, and this is the hint (remez) that “the crows brought him bread” that is to say that even the husks agreed with him.

And a person needs to conquer the level of purifying their thoughts until they are completely pure, since the central piece are the thoughts, and this is what the Sages of Blessed Memory  explain: “your rounded thighs [are like jewels] (Song of Songs 7:2) - why are the words of Torah compared to thighs? Just as thighs are hidden, so too words of Torah are hidden” (Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 992:29) the explanation is that just as the hidden thigh is a hint to the sin of nocturnal emission, that comes to a man due to extraneous thoughts, G!d forbid, and the thoughts are hidden, to [correct] this one needs a constant/disciplined teshuvah to fix through words of Torah in hiding, that is, one needs to occupy oneself with Torah with a pure heart and for Torah’s sake alone, and it is impossible to cleanse one’s thoughts in one moment, one needs to attain that level every time until from heaven they will help the person.
