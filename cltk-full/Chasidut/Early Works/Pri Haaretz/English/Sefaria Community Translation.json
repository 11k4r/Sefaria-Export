            "1": "And the concept is related to the Sages z'l who said \"Three good gives did the Holy One give to Israel, and all were on account of suffering, Torah, the Land of Israel, and the World to Come\", and they explained them all from what it written.", 
            "0": "In the passuk of Sh'lach Lecha: Rashi z'l explains that The Holy One did not consent rather only did not protest against then, and said 'if you want, send'.", 
            "3": " It is known that the truth and nature of the creations is to gravitate toward their root, 'the passage's purpose is to drag' - It is the way of the Inanimate to sprout and elevate from its place, and the way of the Animate things to grow in order to enter the life of the Speaking things. Though they know nothing [of it] they are imprinted [to be this way] naturally. And if so, it is appropriate to [therefore] refer [this to] the letters of the Torah which through them was the world created in order to gravitate toward its source. For the attributes precede the creation of the world by two thousand years, are the entire physical creation extended from [them] from its origin, for there is nothing without the attributes. And they are the [thing which] stands up the body from the lower and its life-force to the ever higher. So separating the life-force from the body until its nullification from emotion [to the point wherein] there would be no difficult suffering from it, as it known by those who investigate that all the sufferings of the body come from the the powers of the heart, and every suffering is a separation from cleaving [to the divine]. And this is the concept of all weakness, may God have mercy, as is known from the concept of the separation of the soul from the body which is from the seven judgments, as is known.", 
            "2": "The concept it - it is known that our Sages z'l said \"Through the Torah the Holy One cared the world\", and these are the letters of the Torah as is known, and it is expounded in the Sefer Yetzirah and affixed in the mouth that the letters were affixed regularly in the mouth, and the illumination of the letters awaken all the worlds from the [supernal] attributes and downward, for they are the origin of the worlds and their revelation, in this aspect of 'I will build the world from loving-kindness', and there's nothing desirable which will be beyond the attributes rather [he merely need] call-out [to him]. This is recalled by the Zohar by 'a loud depth' which is upward - for it is the depth of the heart, which cannot be garbed in the letters.", 
            "5": "Our Sages z'l bring forth the saying 'blessed is the man who God torments and learns from his Torah', and we can explain this in a few ways. 1 - It is known that [the divine name] YH is half of the name [HVYH], and all the defects of man are a result of separating the letters of God('s) [name] as is known.  There are people of unrefined bodies who do not suffer except by bring hit or trampled, for the fool will understand from the rebuke of these blows a hundred [times as much], for he is tortured by [these] things, which would not work without these torments for he is unrefined. This is not the case in regards to the freedom of one who has the Torah, inscribed on the tablets. And our Sages z'l explained freedom, as is known, as the 'world of freedom', that he understands and is wise, which is known that they are [the] two thousand years and are higher than the attributes, he suffers from things which are the letters gravitating toward their source which is the Torah.", 
            "4": "Indeed in this case there is no separation, for their remains an imprint from the perspective of the concealed spirituality. Nevertheless, it is understandable that sufferings increase until the body remains standing without any life-force, as is known from the Prophets and Writings of Daniel and his successors, who were truly sick from their nullification of their feelings.", 
            "7": "But this requires a bit of explanation. As is known in relation to the concept of the Manna that it was a bread from heaven, and was one a level above the Earth and as spiritual as is known. This is seemingly difficult for how is it possible to misuse something divine from God for [evil] urges, and for it to be spiritual food as it was divorced from evil?", 
            "6": "And this is as the Sages z'l explained with the words \" 'And teach him from your Torah' we learn from an a fortiori inference from the law of 'an eye and a tooth' through which the salve attains his freedom; suffering that cleanses a person's entire body all the more so...' And the abrasions refine the physicality and nullify the evil completely. For he had involved good and evil in all his attributes and could not return in the state he was, like 'tooth and eye' which cannot [ever] be returned. And in this this we can resolve the difficulty that the world is beset with suffering - and the body to its strength. And a person that \"understands\" is tormented by these things - attaining understanding of the separation of the letters which occurred by his hand God forbid. And this is \"Happy is the man God {YH} torments\"; meaning, the Wisdom and Understands which are Y and H. And this is \"teach him from your Torah\" which are the bodies of the Torah, accordingly he gifted the Land of Israel through suffering.", 
            "9": "This is as we've already learned that everything is according the the way of the person, and God forbid is can further actualized as referenced [above], because everything depends on preparation and the how one invites [the process]. The rule is ", 
            "8": "But the concept is as is known from the statement of the Zohar \"Even an angel that desires to be seen in this world needs to dress in garments of this world\". And this is the way of all spiritual simplicity - that is conforms in its descent to the manner and way of the vessel in which is dresses, as is known from the analogy of water which conforms to the shape of the vessel whether circular or square. And thus even the simple spiritual in its descent into Man and its entry, changes in accordance with the man, if he is good or bad will come to fruition. For all will come to fruition according to what the Man is. In the scornful person the spiritual causes all the more evil, because much of the spiritual life-force is thin in the shell {k'lipa} and a scornful person resultantly becomes more and more [evil]. God's intention in giving the Land of Israel to Israel was to sustain them with the sustenance of the Land of Israel which is in the quality of the Manna, and \"absorbs water from the rains of heaven\", which is the Holy one himself and not via a ministering [angel], and as is explained in the sefer Chesed L'Avraham, which is therefore why the eating of Manna ceased upon going to the Land [of Israel], because they did not require it. This is per the first idea [above]."

            "1": "Rashi comments z'l \"on account of the family affairs...\" And the notion that [Moshe] spoke strongly \"Why have You dealt ill with Your servant... If You would deal thus with me, kill me rather, I beg You, and let me see no more of my wretchedness!‚Äù", 
            "0": "The passuk reads \" The riffraff in their midst felt a gluttonous craving...they cried for their families\"", 
            "3": "And so a person [must] remember [this] and take care during his learning the Torah how he speaks the letters of the Torah, for with them was the world created, and by himself attach the letters to their root letters in the Torah, which was given like this to the world through 'thunder and lightening' in order that 'the fear of God should be upon you and you will be without sin', as explained. In any case, if 'awe' and 'fear' befall a person in 'thunder and lightening', its seems apparent that he would not sing, God forbid. For how could there be the possibility of sin with all that. And this is the idea of the 'heavenly voice which goes forth', they are the letter of the Torah inside every person who recalls and declares them daily. And he who doesn't not hear the heavenly voice [and for whom] it is as if he did not declare, 'woe unto him...for insulting the Torah' which is inside of him. And this is the meaning of 'for anyone who does not involve himself in the Torah' meaning - who is not inscribed in the Torah, \"he is called \"rebuked\"'; for this is the idea of rebuke for a person which changes his 'face to redness'", 
            "2": "This idea is in accordance with the saying of the Sages z'l in Ethics of our Fathers, \"Each day a heavenly voice emerges from mount Horeb and declares...\" For it is known that there are six hundred thousand souls in Israel, accordingly the same [number of] letters in the Torah; as is known the the Torah, The Holy One, and Israel are all one, and Israel is the body of/for the Torah, and it is known that through the Torah The Holy One created the world which is letters. And there can be nothing in the world without the letters which bring life to it for they are the speech of The Holy One and if the letters disappeared and weren't perceptible, the speaker prior to his speaking what can be said of his speech(?) - that the letters are in potential and not perceptible - it is a general principle is that the life force of each thing are the letters within it. And if a man sins God Forbid, the letters which are the life-force enter Evil and give power to Evil, and also it doesn't appear in the eyes of the flesh that the truth is known. And thus he gives a confession of [these] things in saying 'I sinned' with bitterness of heart on account of his Awe of God combined with Love of God. And through this the letters which were providing life-force to Evil leave and the Evil is left without the life-force and is consequently nullified. ", 
            "5": "But the 'Rabble-rousers' who were not of Israel, but who also were refined upon eating the Manna and ought not have desired any physicality, nonetheless they had such urges. Meaning, that they desired to love of physicality [again], because they were not of Israel, and it was impossible for them to exist entirely with their life-force being Knowledge, and thus they asked to eat meat. ", 
            "4": "Our Rabbis of holy memory said that all the souls of Israel until Moshiach stood at Sinai and received the Torah, which are the letters of their roots whose 'remembrancers take no rest'. IT is known that Moshe is the Knowledge of all of Israel who are the six hundred thousand souls. And the Manna was on account of Moshe's merit in order to enliven Israel with bread from Heaven which since it was spiritually flavored, any desired taste, which is the life-force itself without any rain because Moshe was separated from his wife which is the aspect of physicality, so thus Israel was provided sustenance - and this is 'the Torah wasn't given except to those who ate Manna' for it is the life-force which are the letters which is not the case in regards to physical eating which is a \"whisperer [which] separateth familiar friends\". This is why we must be careful in regards to eating the heart of an animal on account of the soul which depends on it. And so upon Israel eating the Manna, the shed their [physical] filth and did not desire a single [animalistic] urge or love of physicality only for God himself. "

            "3": "4 It is a puzzle that the \"world is upon ten utterances and could have been on one..\" and does God 'deal imperiously with his creations'? Insofar as he was able to create with a single utterance why did he create with ten utterances - in order to interpose punishment in the ten utterances? But in truth the concept of the ten utterances are ten instances of \"And he said\" as are written in the order of creation, in which each \"And he said\" was a different specific creation. As is known to us through the concept and knowledge revealed to us. For the concealed things are to God our Lord, but it is explained in the book of the Torah \"And he said let there be light\", \"and there was a firmament\", and so all the creation of the heavens and earth and pooled waters and animals and birds, and after them all \"and He created man\" who encompasses the upper and lower worlds, as Rashi z'l explains.", 
            "2": "3 And our Sages of blessed memory said \"With ten utterances was the world created, but behold with one utterance wasn't it able to be created?...But to bring goodly reward...Ten generations from Adam...Ten generations from Noah to Abraham...He received the reward of them all.\"", 
            "4": "And our Sages of blessed memory said \"the end of an action begins in thought\", that all were only created for the sake of Man. And our Sages of blessed memory said \"The whole world was not created except for this [Man]\". And so the entire world behaves in accordance with Man as its says \"And have dominion over the fish of the sea...\", And has King David peace be upon him said \"You made him have dominion over the works of his hand all which you put under his feet\". And as the concept is in the lower worlds, so to it is in the upper worlds which were created with Man over them all. As our Sages of blessed memory said \"There is not a blade of grass below which does not have an Angel above...which tells it to grow\", And once Man existed to rule over everything below, also he rules over the angels and their superiors and the upper worlds which were created for him, for he is King over all. 'With this the world(s) ascend and with this they descend'. And via the spirit of Man which ascends ever high in order to cling to Him who is blessed or the spirit of Man and Animal which descends very low God forbid, and all the worlds and creations follow him inasmuch as they are all included with him, as is known that the animal soul in Man is the soul of desire, and all the creations accordingly. And if Man pursues his animal soul (desires), he becomes an animal in the form/appearance of man, and in the thing which he spoiled he must rectify, as its explained in relation to the sacrifice of the Sotah - where she acted as an animal, her offering feeds an animal. And this is the conception of all sacrifices/offerings \"from an animal...from cattle...from sheep\". Apart from the hidden things which are the God our Lord, the idea is to rectify his animal action and return to God as the priests will instruct him when he brings his sacrifice. And through this all the lowest creatures are elevated up high and those which "
