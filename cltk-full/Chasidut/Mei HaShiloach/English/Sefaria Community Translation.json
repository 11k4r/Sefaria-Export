                    "4": "The text does not say “Ani,” for if it had done so, it would have suggested that the Holy One Blessed Be He revealed all of His light to Israel, in its fullness, and that thereafter they would not have been able to go deeper in His words, for He had already revealed everything. Thus the kaf [separating ani from anochi – ed.] teaches that it was not in its fullness, but rather an image, a likeness, of the light that God will reveal in the future. And all that a man will grasp in going deeper in the words of Torah will show that, until this point, he was in darkness. Day and night suggest this reality. The day is when God opens the gates of wisdom to people. The night is so that the person will not think that he has grasped everything in its entirety. For all that he has grasped is like the nighttime, when compared to the daytime that will come afterwards. And so it always is. Thus everything is nighttime in comparison to the light that God will open up in the future. This is what is suggested by the conjunction of the verse “Do not make an idol (pesel).” The Zohar teaches that “this verse is taught on account of the [later verse], ‘Make for yourself (p’sol l’cha) [two tablets],’--therefore, do not make an idol, and do not make yourself a servant of another Torah.” The idea here is that the word pesel means something which is cut, delimited, finished and without anything missing. But this is only found in the Torah of Moses. In human thought, nothing can be finished and made completely whole. As the Midrash (Ruth Rabbah 3:2) tells: Caesar said to Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania, “I am also able to make a Torah like Moses.” And he decreed that no one light a fire for three days. But in those three days he saw smoke coming from a certain house. The Caesar was told that one of his ministers was ill, and he decided to allow [the minister to make the fire in his house]. Of course, in our holy Torah we have this same rule, that saving a life outweighs Shabbat. But the difference is that one who desecrates Shabbat to save a life does not transgress the holy Torah, because the commandment to do so is part of the Torah. Likewise, in every place in which we invoke “When it is time to do for God,” we have a hint of “abrogate your law” (Ps. 119:12). Thus the Torah contains within it all of its own future abrogations, and its light encompasses all contingencies and all circumstances that could possibly come to be. No man has the power to do this. This is how the Zohar interprets “Do not make a pesel” – this refers to the positive commandments. “Or image” – this refers to the negative commandments. For nothing is revealed to any person in its entirety. \n"

Even though G-d opened up a small opening (that enabled them to do so) they widened it with their wisdom in order to do the will of their creator, and understood things that G-d didn't explicitly reveal to them.  This is the meaning of the words \"HITHALCHU\" - they walked from their own power, but I (Jacob am different) because 'G-d is my shepherd until this day' -i.e. that in every detail of every thing that I do, I need G-d to enlighten me as to his will.  Even in this situation where I have seen G-d's will (of my own accord), I still need to see at this time what G-d wants of me.  In this light, Jacob is the greatest of the forefathers, because it is a higher level for G-d to constantly be leading him.  This was the prayer of David of blessed memory, when he prayed: \" G-d is my shepherd I shall not lack\", meaning that I should never lack the protection that G-d has over me, and that he should constantly shepherd me, and I should constantly recognise that G-d is my shepherd.  Because, G-d, in his goodness leads everything.  Even if man turns his head away and doesn't want to expect (something to occur) or to pray, and at a time when a person prays a complete prayer then he is answered, and he will see that G-d is the shepherd.  This is the meaning of the words \" I will not lack\" - that I will not turn my face away from him. "

The reason was due to Korach taking a talit that was entirely techelet (blue color) and asked whether it was not required to also have blue tzitzit.  The idea from this is that techelet (blue) teaches us about awe (\"yirah\").  Korach claimed that awe of Hashem would be evident to him and that everything is in the hands of G-d (shamayim) including awe of G-d (whereas the accepted understanding was that everything is in the hands of G-d outside of our choice to have awe of G-d).  Thus, how is it possible for a person to do something against the will of Hashem since all will and action is from Hashem and how can one do something that is not His will.  And on this he claimed that we would not also have to color the tzitzit blue; tziztit is hint to awe.  And in truth, the will of Hashem in this world will exist through the eyes of man.  As is says in the Gemara (Hagiga 13a) that Ezekiel prayed the face of the bull and transformed into the Keruv (face of an angel), because a bull alludes to wisdom that clarifies things a lot and creates deepens everything in the context of G-d. The free will of man is not only the negative shells (negative desires) and is also not only according to his knowledge, because Hashem conceals His ways from man desires the the work of man.  And if everything was revealed before man there would be no work to do.  And this explains Ezekial's prayer that switched to a carob tree.  That the ways of Hashem are concealed and parallel to man that are functions of their free will.  And from this will come to their hearts work for Hashem which is the meaning of the face of the Keruv.   "

In fact, all of Israel is without number, and what is written \"the number will be\" is said over every single specific soul of Israel, that every single one will be counted, that is, something of consequence in the counting, and important in the eyes of the Holy One of Blessing, as it is written \"Ad-nai will count in the register of peoples [that each was born there.]\" (Psalms 87:6) \"And to Zion it says: every person was born in her\" (Psalms 87:5) - this is that God does providence also with the other peoples, just not specifically on every single soul, but on all as a whole. \"And to Zion it says 'every person was born in her' - this means that the Holy One is interested in every single soul. And this is the explanation for \"and the number will be\" that every single person is needed, since through the community of Israel the greatnesses of the Holy One are made known, and if one is missing then the demeanor is missing. This is similar to when they draw the face of the king in thousands of tablets, and if one is missing - something of the face of the king is missing. And at the moment that one is counted in Israel he is the greatest of all Israel, since all Israel is a piece of the Holy One of Blessing, as it is written \"A piece of Ad-nai is His people\" (Deuteronomy 32:9) and every single one holds within oneself one of the aspects of the Holy One of Blessing, and at the moment s/he is counted then the Holy One was in that aspect that s/he is held by and therefore s/he is the greatest - and through this every single person of Israel is heightened/elevated."

As it says (Song of songs, 5:9): \"What is your beloved more than another beloved...my beloved is white and red, etc.\"  Thus the Lord Blessed be He, behaves with the Isrealites unlike how He behaves with the nations, in that there is no evil that reaches the depth of the Isrealite's life.  In areas of lack and death there is no finality for them.  The death of an Isrealite is unlike the death of one from the nations because death of one from the nations is a \"broken tool\" and does not have any further ability to correct (tikkun), but the death of an Isrealite is not just a tool for a broken physical body (lit. dismanted spine).  And thus in the time of the galut (\"exile), the Isrealites boast to the nations that they are not burdened even a little because they understand that everything comes from the the hands of the G-d, Blessed be He.  And further in their wisdom and glory, the nations have no national conception and knowledge of G-d as does the Israelites.  And therefore the nations appoint the Israelites for three tasks on which no different in hue creates separation between them, as on this they were commanded to take upon themselves, meaning to the level of Moses, that can be found in every Isrealite.  Because Moses is the root source of wisdom of the Isrealites and to Moses was made clear the reason for using the red heifer; since a heifer is a hint to having clarity in life. And the red color is a metaphor for \"cycles.\"  Cycles refer to \"cycles of redness\" which refer to not being weakened at all from cycles that exist in life.  And the idea that the red heifer must not be blemished refers to the lack of blemish in the wisdom of the Isrealites; there is no lack within it and rather only clear thought (lit. wisdom).   The fact that a yoke was never placed on the red heifer refers to the fact that the Isrealites were never under control of any force other than the Lord Blessed be He who rules over them alone.  As it says (Zecharia 10:6): \"They shall be as though I had not forsaken them.\" And this is made clear through the parable of Joseph and his brothers.  Even though the brothers first experienced pain and then Joseph made known that he was their brother and he made clear that no harm would ever come to them.  Rather they only had pain for only a moment.  The Lord Blessed be He in the future will make clear that any pain is only for a moment and there will be no real pain for the soul's of the Isrealites.  As it says (Kohelet 7:23): \"I will become wise but it was far from me.\" All understanding was clear to [King Solomon], he nevertheless says he will become wise which refers to becoming wise regarding knowing this understanding of the future thus saying \"it was far from me.\"  Of Moses it says  (Midrash Tanchuma 8): \"And to you I will reveal.\" Moses' wisdom was only to know and not to become wiser to His ways.  This was the knowledge that King Solomon also knew but was not in his currently within in conception, therefore he said it was still far from him, meaning it was outside the borders of his mind.  This is why the section on the red heifer is placed before the section of the death of the three shepherds.  Such that the Isrealites should know this and not become distressed.  The heifer purifies sin which hints to the future where everything will return to its perfected state."
