For when a person desires to follow the advice of their [evil] inclination in any matter, the \"family of the inclination\" -- many families, and many supports, does the inclination have to [persuade one] to follow it. \"To Shalem\", that when a person wishes to walk in wholeness [<i>shleimut</i>]of service, the family of wholeness... as stated above. And it completes it, this is its language, and it says this also \"To Tachan, the Tachani family\" (Numbers 26:35) -- when a person wishes to pray and plead [<i>lehitchanein</i>], then it is the Tachani family, as stated above."
