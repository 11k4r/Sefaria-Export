                        "27": "And from the outset it is surprising: where were the students, that the text says that they arrived? Initially one would have thought that they were sitting with them, but this is the explanation: when the righteous ones were sitting on that night and telling about the Exodus they attained the life-force from the Blessed Creator until the night was illuminated in every aspect, as it was when the Jews came out of Egypt, that all became the aspect of memory, as it is known, since the receiving of memory is called night, and coming out of Egypt was through leaps, and a complete union happened as the night shone like the day. And this is the explanation that they were reclining in Bnei Brak, which is 30 flashings and clarifications, and they were telling the Exodus, meaning, through their telling they attained the life force of the Blessed Creator, that illuminated for them as clear as day, as we said. And this is the expression \"they were telling about the Exodus all through that night\" - that through them the complete union, an aspect of memory. And this is \"all through that night\": until they made the night become this aspect. And all is in the expression memory. Until the students arrived, meaning, that through their clarifications the students were able to attain the life force and the holy unifications too. The students said to them \"our masters, you illuminated for us also the upper lights that make up the night\", and they said \"time has come\" - that time has touched the reading of the morning Shema. Meaning, that they raised time, from this world until time touched the reading of the morning Shema. And what is the issue of reading of the Shema? Since the Exodus is itself the aspect of reading the Shema, as known. The reading of the Shema is mesirat nefesh (total dedication) and the Exodus was also mesirat nefesh. Since the essence is total dedication until all is unified on a simple unity, and this is the essence of the story of coming out of Egypt, that one comes out from the dominion of the Evil Inclination. And through me's speaking about the Exodus, one comes out from slavery to freedom, and all the night is illuminated. And this is why it is written \"after that\"."
