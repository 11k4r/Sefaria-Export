And the Holy Blessed One said, ‘since your light is My light, and My light is your light, let us walk together and light up Zion’. This is as it is written, ‘arise, My light, for your light has arrived’”",
                        "25": "It is written, “for with You is the source of life, in Your light we will see light” (Psalms 36:10). For every member of Israel must first awaken themselves through the light of the Blessed God that is within them. For each and every one possesses this, each according to their own state and level. But it is merely buried and covered up by nonsense and worldly vanities. And one must first awaken themselves with all their strength, to cause this light to shine, each according to their own level. And then, the light from above will reach them to cause them to shine more and more. And this is [the meaning of the words] “in Your light” (Psalms 36:10) meaning in the light of the Blessed God that is within us, “we will see light” (ibid) referring to the light of abundance that pours upon one from above. And [the Karliner Rebbe] spoke above this in terms of the statement from the Holy Zohar: “The white light does not dwell until there is a dark light below.” As we see, that the bottom of a candle is black, and there is a white light that rests upon the black light from above. And this relates to what is mentioned in a number of places in the Holy Zohar, “the darkness of the morning.” For before the light of day arrives, it becomes increasingly dark, as we see with our own eyes. And likewise within a person. For the arousal from below is called “a black light”, for a person needs to awaken themselves specifically in their time of darkness. As the verse says, “and she rises when it is still night” (Proverbs 31:15). And when one is roused sufficiently, then a white light from above rests upon them. And this is [the meaning of] “arise, My light” - the black light from below - “for your light has arrived” - the white light from above is ready to pour upon you. And what is the meaning of “arise” [kumi]? For a person needs to be a complete edifice [komah shleima]. And this is [the meaning of], “arise [kumi] My light” - you shall seek to cause your entire stature to shine.\n"

                        "27": "And from the outset it is surprising: where were the students, that the text says that they arrived? Initially one would have thought that they were sitting with them, but this is the explanation: when the righteous ones were sitting on that night and telling about the Exodus they attained the life-force from the Blessed Creator until the night was illuminated in every aspect, as it was when the Jews came out of Egypt, that all became the aspect of memory, as it is known, since the receiving of memory is called night, and coming out of Egypt was through leaps, and a complete union happened as the night shone like the day. And this is the explanation that they were reclining in Bnei Brak, which is 30 flashings and clarifications, and they were telling the Exodus, meaning, through their telling they attained the life force of the Blessed Creator, that illuminated for them as clear as day, as we said. And this is the expression \"they were telling about the Exodus all through that night\" - that through them the complete union, an aspect of memory. And this is \"all through that night\": until they made the night become this aspect. And all is in the expression memory. Until the students arrived, meaning, that through their clarifications the students were able to attain the life force and the holy unifications too. The students said to them \"our masters, you illuminated for us also the upper lights that make up the night\", and they said \"time has come\" - that time has touched the reading of the morning Shema. Meaning, that they raised time, from this world until time touched the reading of the morning Shema. And what is the issue of reading of the Shema? Since the Exodus is itself the aspect of reading the Shema, as known. The reading of the Shema is mesirat nefesh (total dedication) and the Exodus was also mesirat nefesh. Since the essence is total dedication until all is unified on a simple unity, and this is the essence of the story of coming out of Egypt, that one comes out from the dominion of the Evil Inclination. And through me's speaking about the Exodus, one comes out from slavery to freedom, and all the night is illuminated. And this is why it is written \"after that\"."
