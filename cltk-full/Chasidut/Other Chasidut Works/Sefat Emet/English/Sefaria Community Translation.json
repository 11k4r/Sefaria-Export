One must understand the solution given regarding all of the Torah portions from Bereshit until \"...this very month\". The interpretation of the matter is that the essence of the Torah is the mitzvot--this is the written Torah--but the Holy Blessed One wanted to clarify that this world and the entire Creation [exists] because of the 'power of Torah', as it says \"B-reishit\": He looked within the Torah and created the world [according to it].\" And this matter [is in contrast] with Oral Torah, which is dependent on human activity. Thus, all the Torah portions concerned with the stories of forefathers [are there] to show how Torah was created by their deeds. This is what is meant by \"the strength of His deeds\"--the power that the Holy Blessed One suffused within Creation. This is why it is called \"the work/deed of Creation\" to declare that the world was created with ten utterances, and the life-force of the world by means of the Torah. The task of humanity, then, is to understand that every deed is a result of the Holy Blessed One's life-force. When a person performs any action, it is [only] because of the power of Torah to fulfill the will of the Creator, thus renewing the light hidden within Creation. This is hinted at in the verse \"I have put my words in your mouth...who laid the foundations of the earth and say to Zion 'You are my people'.\" The sages interpret the verse: Don't read ami/my people--rather immi/with me, as a partner in the work of Creation. The Zohar interprets 'Zion' as the inner point within all things as a imprint and sign to remember that the Holy One is [the source] of all things. This is the life-force which animates all things. The person who clings to this inner point and all of His life-force which flows from this point becomes a partner in the work of Creation. As a result of this ...\"in order that He might give them the inheritance of the nations”--an inheritance without restraints. When a person joins the natural world to its active potential, nature cannot obscure the power of holiness. "

He heard the call of 'go forth' which comes out from God to all people at all time, as it says 'oy to those who sleep in their holes (and do not hear)!' Our father Avraham heard the call and received its message. Perforce the Divine word was calling to him alone, because there was no one but he listening. Certainly this itself is his greatest praise - that he was ready to receive the call. "

For until now Yaakov was involved with the difficult task of combating the 'klipa' the spiritual husk covering the holiness, of Eisav , Lavan and Shechem. Now Yaakov settled down and connected to his source, which is the idea of Shabbos, which is the idea of completely nullifying oneself to the source. This is what is meant by the Medrash that Yaakov gathering in of himself and his children saved him. Just as it says by Shabbos that it becomes one with the secret of Oneness. And through this connection with the oneness all the negativity falls away. And similarly when Yaakov ran away from Eisav. The Medrash says לֹא שָׁלַוְתִּי וְלֹא שָׁקַטְתִּי, לֹא שָׁלַוְתִּי מֵעֵשָׂו, וְלֹא שָׁקַטְתִּי מִלָּבָן, וְלֹא נָחְתִּי מִדִּינָה, וַיָּבֹא רֹגֶז, בָּא עָלַי רָגְזוֹ שֶׁל יוֹסֵף. Yaakov did not have any rest From Eisav, Lavan Dina and Yosef. When tzadikim want to also have calmness in this world Because the will of the tzadik is to add more glory to HaShem in this world where his glory is covered and hidden. (Through revealing HaShem in everything). This is the idea of Yosef, which is connected to the concept of adding onto Shabbos before and after Shabbos. For through all the work of the 6 days, one yearns to receive the Shabbos with love. And through this one is able to even add Shabbos to the days of the week. [This idea is like the idea that water reflects whatever it sees, so too one's heart is reflected in another person. Just as a bridegroom goes to his bride, she comes out to greet him]. And this is indeed a great task to bring the holiness of Shabbos literally into the days of the week. (Certain laws of Shabbos apply during that time) This therefore is the meaning of the Medrash: The tzadikim wish to be at ease in this world. For they are bringing the idea of The world to come, a world which is always Shabbos, into this world. However they also want to be at ease in this world, and having this come easy in this world is not possible and therefore there is much hiddenness. (Bringing the concept of the world to come into this world, cannot be the same way as it is in the world to come. It is restricted, and covered by the husk of these worldly matters. This is what is meant by the adversity of Yosef. As Rashi explains Yosef was the Flame whereas Yaakov was the fire. And a fire without a flame cannot reach far. Yosef’s mission was to bring the flame of the fire to far places (even into this world, and therefore he was able to be Eisav’s adversary). This is what is mentioned in the Medrash that He saw a group of dogs and he sat between them. Yaakov also wanted to purify and extract the holiness even from the ‘dogs’, from the lowliness of this world. Similarly after the end of last week's parsha which goes through all the kings of Eisav, Yaakov goes and sits between them and through his flame is able to burn down all their ‘husks’"

And so too in these days, that they merited to sing Halel and to give thanks for the miracle in which there is renewal, and that renewal remains forever. And the reason is that through the song there is renewal because a miracle is a door to the Root Above Nature, and in there, there is always renewal, since \"there is nothing new under the sun\" - but above the sun there is.

He explained that, in the lamp, there is an aspect of illumination and one of combustion, that being to burn the waste material and to purge the inside by the fire of desire for Him, may He be blessed.  And Beit Shammai are of the view that, initially, it is necessary to \"depart from evil [and (then) do good]\" (Ps. 34:14), and thus the practice of decreasing day by day.  And Beit Hillel are of the view that the main idea is to increase day by day, such that the enthusiasm that illuminates through him will purify his body and will automatically purge the waste material.  (b) And this is also what is written that Yosef placed Menashe first, while Ya'akov placed Efraim first.  For the name Menashe is from \"God has made me forget [nashani] ... my travail\" (Gen. 41:51), as with \"forget your people and your father's house\" (Ps. 45:11), and he thought this about Ya'akov.  But Ya'akov our ancestor, peace be on him, realized that not everyone is prepared for this, and he placed Efraim first [see Gen. 41:52:  Efraim \"for God has made me fertile (hifrani)\"], corresponding to the view of Beit Hillel.  Thus far [my grandfather's] statement, may his memory be for a blessing.  (c) And according to this, both the formulation \"increases day by day\" and the formulation \"decreases day by day\" make sense, for they are in truth two paths.  There are those who proceed by diminishing the subjugation of the body, and there are those who proceed by increasing the light of the spirit and of the insides.  And this is a matter of \"Ehad marbeh v'ehad mam'it\" [originally, it is all the same whether one does much or one does little, provided that one directs one's mind towards Heaven.  Ber. 5b, 17a].

There is no hiddenness or obscurity (he’elem) before this light. We call the world (olam) which obscures (ma’alim) and hides this light ‘the natural,’ but the original light of creation shone through all these layers of concealment and it was hidden away for the righteous; on this it is written “A light shines for the upright in the darkness…” (Psalms 112:4) It is also written “The people that walked in darkness have seen a brilliant light…” (Isaiah 9:1) The generation which lived in the days of the wicked Greeks walked in darkness, as the Sages taught “darkness refers to Greece which darkened the eyes of Israel…” (Bereshit Raba 2:4), nevertheless they served God with a spirit of self-sacrifice even in the midst of this darkness. That is why they merited that the hidden light shine for them, and some of its illumination remains, radiating from year to year even in these lowly times. Every servant of God must rejoice during these days when a touch of the hidden light illuminates Divine service.

He subjugates himself further through the shame from before Him, may He be blessed. And Mordechai regretted that he caused the whole decree. And now HaShem, may He be blessed, did a kindness like this for him. He became further ashamed. And he returned/repented. Because certainly, repentance through the shame is not like that like before {one has shame}. That there are two (ways of gaining) humility. Firstly, through worthlessness {that a person understands that he is worthless}. And the second, through greatness as it is written elsewhere {that a person realises his greatness - who he is and what he has - and  realises that he doesn't deserve  any of it}. And this is the difference between a tzadik {righteous person} and a rasha {a wicked person} as it is written \"and Haman went out etc.\" ... \"happy and with a good heart\" because of the feast. And this was his downfall. But by Mordechai it says 'and he returned/repented' as written above. Furthermore it is apparent that Mordechai knew that HaShem, may He be blessed, will certainly help the Jewish people as it is written \"relief and deliverance\" etc. And so it's written \"and he knew all that had happened\" etc. However through this way, that all tzadikim {righteous}, that even though they know of the salvation, nevertheless they are able to cry out with a truly complete heart as if they didn't know. And someone that isn't {on that level}, the true salvation isn't shown to him. And this is dependent on complete faith that one nullifies his intellect to HaShem, may He be blessed, and he knows and believes that there is no contradiction in any of this, that the salvation arrives through the outcry of man. Even though HaShem, may He be blessed, will not forsake the Jewish people, without question. Nevertheless it is necessary to cry out in a time of distress as it is written \"a time of distress\" etc. and from that, one will be saved."

And thus it says in Shir HaShirim Rabbah (4:8:3), \"This has already been made known\" (Isa. 12:5); see there on verse 4:8.  However, in truth, one must rouse oneself and sing the song, so that the joy and the love overcome the fear, and this is what is added (Exod. 14:31):  \"The people feared, etc.,\" and nevertheless, \"they believed\" and they responded to the miracle and sang a song before Him.  And the Israelites had to establish this clearly, that, while \"He has triumphed gloriously,\" He is nevertheless close to His People, and [they had] to refute the evil ones who say that God does not concern Himself with what happens in the world."

This is based on the verse that says: \"...the Lord God fashioned garments of skin for the man and his wife and God dressed them.\" (Genesis 3:21) The Midrash refers to a distinction between the \"garments of skin\" and \"garments of light.\" It was because of sin that they came to be garbed in this coarse clothing, the skin of the snake. All of corporeality derives from there. Previously, they were in a spiritual state, as is said of the future. At the giving of the Torah, too, Israel were ready for this state. That is why it says of Moses that the skin of his face shone. (Exodus 34:29) He so redeemed \"skin\" that he was lit up through the shining speculum. But we did not remain at that rung. Therefore, the afflictions reappeared; the Midrash teaches that it was sin that made us again impaired. It is also known, however, that the skin is porous, containing many tiny holes. These allow the light to shine through its \"shells.\" Only sin clogs up those pores, so that \"darkness covers the earth.\" (Isaiah 60:2) That is why \"the leprous affliction\" is translated [into Aramaic] as <i>segiru</i> or \"closing.\" Now we also understand why the purification rites are assigned to Aaron and his sons the priests; it was they who set right the sin of the Golden Calf."

Because the Bnei Yisroel were already a holy congregation and what is the relevance to warn them from acting like these sinners? But the explanation (comes to teach us) that there should not be any act of a Jew that is like/similar to the acts of the wicked that all their acts are for worldliness alone. Rather the Bnei Yisroel need to sanctify all their actions to cleave to the source of the life-force and to take from it life-force. Because the action needs to be only for the purpose that man 'walks' in the service of HaShem (may He be blessed) and simple Jews are directed to eat and drink to add strength in their service of the Creator which is also a general (form of) 'walking'. And what also of the righteous that all their actions are for the sake of Heaven, and so too with every commandment that a person does, it needs to be directed (one should perform it with the intent) that through this (the performance of the commandment) he will come to greater holiness that he could add at all times from one (spiritual) level to the next (spiritual) level. Like (the concept that fulfilment of a) 'commandment brings another commandment'. And it won't be that the commandment was done simply to be discharged from the obligation, rather on the contrary, that through the merit of this, one will receive (the opportunity for) other commandments, as it's written, that the reward for (fulfilling a) commandment is (the opportunity to fulfil another) commandment. And this is what it means 'to follow/walk in them' etc., and to take from them life-force as it's written 'and live (by) them' (or possibly, and life is within them)."

This is the receiving of the Flow of heaven, that clings to the Upper Root and this is the internalness (penimiut) of the Flow. As it is written in the Holy Zohar regarding the day of Shabbat, that even though manna did not come down on that day, all blessings are dependent on the seventh day, see there (Zohar 2:184a:7). And this is why the bread is called lechem hapanim, it is the internalness of the Flow, as it is written \"not on bread alone does a person live, etc, comes out from God's mouth\" (Deut. 8:3) - this is Torah. And a hint of this is what is written there: \"Face to face did Hashem speak with you on the mountain, from the midst of the fire\" (Deut. 5:4) - and here \"bread of faces\". And the root of the bread from heaven is that it flows from the holy Shabbat to all the days of the week, with the force of the Torah, according to the readiness of the children of Israel that Torah gave to them. And just as there are 53 parshiot in the Torah and in each Shabbat we read a different parsha, this is also true in heaven, see Zohar on Vayakhel. And this is that the Torah, being all made of Divine Names, still has the parsha that changes every week, and every Shabbat has different combination of phrases. This too is hinted by the bread of faces, that on every Shabbat is was set. And according to the 12 loaves that the children of Israel set in order, so too the Flow of heaven continues. And it is written \"as face answers to face in water\" (Prov. 27:19) and this is an aspect of the Torah, that is Oral and Written. And in our parshe it is written \"on the day of Shabbat\". There is Shabbat that comes from Above to Below and there is Shabbat that comes from Below to Above, as explained in the Holy Zohar. And therefore the Text said \"according to the arranging of the of the bread on the day of Shabbat in a Awakening from Below, so too in the day of Shabbat from Above to Below it will be this arranging, and as it is written in Chagigah 26b \"as its arranging is its taking away.\" And the Torah is a gift to the children of Israel, and according to their level is the Torah's revealing itself to them, since there are seventy faces to the Torah, and \"face to face\". And on every Shabbat the Flow is renewed through the force of the Torah. [\"The One who renews each day Creation with goodness\", Bereshit is Torah, which is called good, and regarding Shabbat it is written \"it is good to thank Hashem\", a hint that every moment a new interpretation is invited] and so too on Shavuot when the Torah was given there are two loaves of bread. And \"on every Shabbat\" is a level below \"twelve loaves\", since the Torah is understood and interpreted and gives life and sustenance to every level until this world. And twelve limits and twelve requests that are in the Prayer they are the Lower Supports of the Upper Root, as it is written in different places. "

Thus our Sages taught: A person should always see themselves as if the Holy Presence abides in one’s insides.”, for a holy person should be able to uncover the holy presence within themselves. A person doesn’t create something new by some sort of deed, rather she reveals the innermost life force within her as it says “And He breathed into his mouth life breath”. If a person can believe in this life force, to not forget about it,  and always strive to cleave to the root of this life force, they can merit the “truth by means of trust”, mentioned above. ",

This is as it says (Gen. R.), \"B'reishit -- for the sake of Israel which is called 'reishit.'\" The meaning is that \"reishit\" is the beginning and the inner essence, as it says (Prov.), \"The 'reishit' of wisdom is the awe of God.\" Therefore it is called the Day of Bikkurim, when the fruit is ripe. But B'nai Yisrael \"are excepted from the generality in order to teach to the entire generality\" (Sifra, principles of R' Yishma'el), as it will be in the future (Zeph. 3:9), \"For then I will make the peoples pure of speech, etc. [so that they all invoke Adonai by name and serve Him with one accord].\" And then (Eccl. 7:8) \"The end of a matter is better than the beginning of it\" [see Ruth 3:10]. And in truth, according as B'nai Yisrael elevate from the nations, they are themselves exalted even more. And this itself is the meaning of putting \"na'aseh\" before \"nishma,\" for B'nai Yisrael understood this, that they were chosen in order to draw everyone near, and they said (Ex. 24:7), \"Everything that Adonai has spoken we will do.\" It is written here \"na'aseh\" and it is written there (Gen. 1:26), \"Na'aseh adam,\" as it says (Gen. 12:5) \"the souls that they had made,\" which Onkelos translated \"that they had subjugated to the Torah\", and it is through this that \"we will hear.\" As it is with the particular -- as the improvement [tikkun] of the deeds, in order to draw each physical deed close to the spirit so that the soul shines in the person -- so it is in general -- as the improvement [tikkun] of K'lal Yisrael to draw near from the nations, so that the Torah shines in them. It is written (Micah 7:20), \"You will give truth to Ya'akov, hesed to Avraham,\" for B'nai Yisrael are in truth God's portion and His Torah, but it is also part of the aspect of Truth to do hesed, to bring near those who are far off and who come for the sake of Heaven: \"truth to Ya'akov\" is the Torah, \"hesed to Avraham\" is that we should draw close also from the descendants of Lot -- Ruth the Moabite...."

Answer: this verse applies when we do God's will, and this verse applies when we don't. Sfas Emes asks: but when we're doing God's will, why would we even need favoritism? Answer: it means may God count a little as if it were a lot. (A Midrash (Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nasso.10) also says, in connection with our verse, that Hashem says, \"My people show extra favor to Me! I said to recite a blessing when they eat to satisfaction, but they recite a blessing even on an olive-size morsel of food.\" So you see this is what it means to show extra favor: rejoicing in the tiniest opportunity and counting it as significant.) And it depends on how the person sees it. If a person rejoices at being able to do God's will even in a small way, then God too finds that mitzvah immensely precious. This rejoicing is an expression of the person's innermost essence. And this is what it means וישם לך שלום. Shleimus, completeness, is that innermost point of truth, whose radiance, even the tiniest ray, contains its everything. God is called Shalom; that means God is the completeness of all that exists. When our focus is God's will, that means we're focusing on that innermost point of a mitzvah which is its everything. It's shleimus. The size of a mitzvah is irrelevant when you focus on this essence, on doing God's will. "

Yet an explanation of the pertinence to \"this day\" is still needed. And in the midrash and in Rashi they explained: \"this day[the mitzvot] should be in your eyes as new every day.\" And is it possible that a person would desire to make mistakes even if in truth there is no renewal, Heaven forfend? Yet, a person has the power to renew everything, since obviously there is in every thing the aspect of renewal, behold, the Holy Blessed One renews Creation continuously every day, and the explanation is that continuously means every moment. And also, there is no thing that doesn't have Liveness from the Holy Blessed One, and the Point from God forever, and so it can't become old since God's words are alive and flow constantly. However, when darkness covers the face of the land the external husks hides the Flowing Point. And this is why it is written \"there is nothing new under the sun\", and this is nature and this world, that hide the renewal. However, a person has the strength to illuminate the Point from the darkness, and this is why it is written \"this day the One commands you to do\" - meaning, to find the aspect of \"this day\" which is the uncovering and revealing the light, in the aspect of Mirror of Light. This is also true within an action, which can be what hides said Point. And this [revealing the Point] is done through mitzvot, since \"a mitzvah is light\" (Prov. 6:23), since a mitzvah is a physical action and it contains the Liveness of the Holy Blessed One, in the command to do it, in the strength of a person to cling oneself to the Hidden Light through the action of doing a mitzvah, as explained above and as I wrote in other places. And what is written \"the decrees etc\" which is to say through the mitzvot of the Blessed One, you are given strength to find the aspect of \"this day\" also in an action.

And the explanation of my grandfather, my elder, my teacher and rabbi, of blessed memory, [on the verse] \"faces east\" (Ezekiel 46:1) is as the issue that is written \"the children of Israel came first in thought\", see there (Chiddushei HaRim on Torah, Eikev 4:4). And it is as we explained above, that on Shabbat the Source and the Root from which New Aliveness continuously flows to all creatures is revealed. And one could also say that this is the explanation for \"they are crowned with new souls\" (Siddur Sefard, Shabbat Eve Maariv, Shabbat Eve Maariv 3), that the Aliveness is renewed in the souls of the children of Israel. And the explanation of \"to make the Shabbat\" is that we need to bring the aspect of renewal from the Shabbat to the days of making [ie, the week] as it is written in Sha'ar haKedusha, see there, and also as it is written in other places, that on Shabbat one opens the other days of the week through the aspect of Shabbat, as explained. And according to what a person sorts out and clarifies Aliveness in every thing, and in that person's eyes they are like new, truly Renewal is revealed to that person, and this is what is written: If you listened [shamo’a] to the old,  then you will listen [tishma] to the new (Berakhot 40a), since given that one believes that there is an aspect of the Holy Blessed One hidden in every thing even in the most external, then one merits to reveal the internal, as we explained. And so too \"we will bow and kneel\" - meaning, bowing is one's desire to surrender, and kneeling, is a nif'al verb, which means that according to the will, truly one merits to reveal the truth, to surrender to the real, real truth."

How you followed Me in the wilderness],\" the general idea of the matter is that in Nisan Hashem brought us out of Egypt, and it was through Hashem's lovingkindness alone, as it is written (Ezek. 16:7), \"And you were naked and bare.\"  However, Hashem wanted that this lovingkindness be through the merit of good deeds of the Israelites, so that it would endure forever.  And so it is written (Ps. 62:13), \"The lovingkindness is yours, Lord, for You will repay each person according to his deeds.\"  The meaning is that the Holy One, blessed be He, engineers through His lovingkindness that the person merits this lovingkindness on his own, through his or her own deeds, for everything is ultimately attributable to the Cause of all causes.  And this happened afterwards in that the Israelites traveled into the wilderness and merited the clouds of glory.  The meaning is that the fact that they merited this through their own deeds removes the Accuser from B'nai Yisrael; \"One who eats what is not his, feels ashamed [to look in the face of his benefactor]\" (Yerushalmi, Orlah 1:3), but one who merits through his own deeds is honored.  And see what I have said below [in another piece from Sukkot the same year].  And this matter appears every year.  At Pesah there is the exodus from Egypt through Hashem's lovingkindness.  And afterwards, at Rosh Hashana, a person is judged with regard to whether he has repaired his deeds the lovingkindness.  For all of Hashem's lovingkindness is so that a person will repair his deeds by means of the lovingkindness.  And when he merits by right, the lovingkindness winds up being repaid, even according to the criterion of justice [midat hadin].  And this is the lovingkindness of the holiday of Sukkot -- the lovingkindness that comes by right.  All of this happened to our ancestors, and this is why it says, \"I remembered to your favor the lovingkindness of your youth [... How you followed Me in the wilderness]\"  The meaning is that the Holy One, blessed be He, caused the lovingkindness to be remembered throughout the generations in that it was on account of Israel's own good deeds, and the remembering is by right.  The meaning is that lovingkindness is just for a moment, except that, for one who merits that lovingkindness by right, it endures forever.  (And this is \"[I will make with you an everlasting covenant,] The enduring lovingkindness promised to David.\")  And this why it says, \"I made [the Israelites] live in sukkot,\" for even the sukkot are a reminder of the exodus from Egypt, but they are a reminder of the lovingkindness that was done through the merit of B'nai Yisrael, etc.  And in this way the question of the Tur [why Sukkot is observed in the Fall rather than in Nisan] is resolved."

And the Children of Israel, when they bring themselves together in the name of heaven – in order that their should descent upon the Succah the name of heaven, their end shall be that they shall sustain and remain in this state of Achdut/Oneness. And this is the meaning of this is an Atzeret for you – that you should remain in Oneness. And so all gatherings, this is their explanation – if they gather for the sake of heaven, they shall remain sustained even as each one goes to their own home. And so to on the holy Shabbat – they are drawn into Oneness, and if this is for the sake of heaven, they shall so be sustained in the days of action. So too the Oneness from Sukkot goes with us also home."
