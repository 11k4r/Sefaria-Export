One must understand the solution given regarding all of the Torah portions from Bereshit until \"...this very month\". The interpretation of the matter is that the essence of the Torah is the mitzvot--this is the written Torah--but the Holy Blessed One wanted to clarify that this world and the entire Creation [exists] because of the 'power of Torah', as it says \"B-reishit\": He looked within the Torah and created the world [according to it].\" And this matter [is in contrast] with Oral Torah, which is dependent on human activity. Thus, all the Torah portions concerned with the stories of forefathers [are there] to show how Torah was created by their deeds. This is what is meant by \"the strength of His deeds\"--the power that the Holy Blessed One suffused within Creation. This is why it is called \"the work/deed of Creation\" to declare that the world was created with ten utterances, and the life-force of the world by means of the Torah. The task of humanity, then, is to understand that every deed is a result of the Holy Blessed One's life-force. When a person performs any action, it is [only] because of the power of Torah to fulfill the will of the Creator, thus renewing the light hidden within Creation. This is hinted at in the verse \"I have put my words in your mouth...who laid the foundations of the earth and say to Zion 'You are my people'.\" The sages interpret the verse: Don't read ami/my people--rather immi/with me, as a partner in the work of Creation. The Zohar interprets 'Zion' as the inner point within all things as a imprint and sign to remember that the Holy One is [the source] of all things. This is the life-force which animates all things. The person who clings to this inner point and all of His life-force which flows from this point becomes a partner in the work of Creation. As a result of this ...\"in order that He might give them the inheritance of the nations”--an inheritance without restraints. When a person joins the natural world to its active potential, nature cannot obscure the power of holiness. "

He heard the call of 'go forth' which comes out from God to all people at all time, as it says 'oy to those who sleep in their holes (and do not hear)!' Our father Avraham heard the call and received its message. Perforce the Divine word was calling to him alone, because there was no one but he listening. Certainly this itself is his greatest praise - that he was ready to receive the call. "

For until now Yaakov was involved with the difficult task of combating the 'klipa' the spiritual husk covering the holiness, of Eisav , Lavan and Shechem. Now Yaakov settled down and connected to his source, which is the idea of Shabbos, which is the idea of completely nullifying oneself to the source. This is what is meant by the Medrash that Yaakov gathering in of himself and his children saved him. Just as it says by Shabbos that it becomes one with the secret of Oneness. And through this connection with the oneness all the negativity falls away. And similarly when Yaakov ran away from Eisav. The Medrash says לֹא שָׁלַוְתִּי וְלֹא שָׁקַטְתִּי, לֹא שָׁלַוְתִּי מֵעֵשָׂו, וְלֹא שָׁקַטְתִּי מִלָּבָן, וְלֹא נָחְתִּי מִדִּינָה, וַיָּבֹא רֹגֶז, בָּא עָלַי רָגְזוֹ שֶׁל יוֹסֵף. Yaakov did not have any rest From Eisav, Lavan Dina and Yosef. When tzadikim want to also have calmness in this world Because the will of the tzadik is to add more glory to HaShem in this world where his glory is covered and hidden. (Through revealing HaShem in everything). This is the idea of Yosef, which is connected to the concept of adding onto Shabbos before and after Shabbos. For through all the work of the 6 days, one yearns to receive the Shabbos with love. And through this one is able to even add Shabbos to the days of the week. [This idea is like the idea that water reflects whatever it sees, so too one's heart is reflected in another person. Just as a bridegroom goes to his bride, she comes out to greet him]. And this is indeed a great task to bring the holiness of Shabbos literally into the days of the week. (Certain laws of Shabbos apply during that time) This therefore is the meaning of the Medrash: The tzadikim wish to be at ease in this world. For they are bringing the idea of The world to come, a world which is always Shabbos, into this world. However they also want to be at ease in this world, and having this come easy in this world is not possible and therefore there is much hiddenness. (Bringing the concept of the world to come into this world, cannot be the same way as it is in the world to come. It is restricted, and covered by the husk of these worldly matters. This is what is meant by the adversity of Yosef. As Rashi explains Yosef was the Flame whereas Yaakov was the fire. And a fire without a flame cannot reach far. Yosef’s mission was to bring the flame of the fire to far places (even into this world, and therefore he was able to be Eisav’s adversary). This is what is mentioned in the Medrash that He saw a group of dogs and he sat between them. Yaakov also wanted to purify and extract the holiness even from the ‘dogs’, from the lowliness of this world. Similarly after the end of last week's parsha which goes through all the kings of Eisav, Yaakov goes and sits between them and through his flame is able to burn down all their ‘husks’"

And so too in these days, that they merited to sing Halel and to give thanks for the miracle in which there is renewal, and that renewal remains forever. And the reason is that through the song there is renewal because a miracle is a door to the Root Above Nature, and in there, there is always renewal, since \"there is nothing new under the sun\" - but above the sun there is. And one who says a song about a miracle makes known that one belongs to and clings to the miracle, and there is renewal in that person.

If this is so, then it appears that each Hannukah candle draws from the or haganuz, the hidden light of creation, and gives light in great darkness, as our Sages hinted with their description of the or haganuz as a light which shined from one end of the world to the other (Chagigah 12a). There is no hiddenness or obscurity (he’elem) before this light. We call the world (olam) which obscures (ma’alim) and hides this light ‘the natural,’ but the original light of creation shone through all these layers of concealment and it was hidden away for the righteous; on this it is written “A light shines for the upright in the darkness…” (Psalms 112:4) It is also written “The people that walked in darkness have seen a brilliant light…” (Isaiah 9:1) The generation which lived in the days of the wicked Greeks walked in darkness, as the Sages taught “darkness refers to Greece which darkened the eyes of Israel…” (Bereshit Raba 2:4), nevertheless they served God with a spirit of self-sacrifice even in the midst of this darkness. That is why they merited that the hidden light shine for them, and some of its illumination remains, radiating from year to year even in these lowly times. Every servant of God must rejoice during these days when a touch of the hidden light illuminates Divine service. The primary intent of the wicked ones was to make us forget God’s laws and Torah, and the Hannukah lights bring us to remembrance."

The explanation for 'and he returned' is that he returned in repentance. This is the way of the tzadik {righteous}, through which he is assisted by HaShem, may He be blessed. He subjugates himself further through the shame from before Him, may He be blessed. And Mordechai regretted that he caused the whole decree. And now HaShem, may He be blessed, did a kindness like this for him. He became further ashamed. And he returned/repented. Because certainly, repentance through the shame is not like that like before {one has shame}. That there are two (ways of gaining) humility. Firstly, through worthlessness {that a person understands that he is worthless}. And the second, through greatness as it is written elsewhere {that a person realises his greatness - who he is and what he has - and  realises that he doesn't deserve  any of it}. And this is the difference between a tzadik {righteous person} and a rasha {a wicked person} as it is written \"and Haman went out etc.\" ... \"happy and with a good heart\" because of the feast. And this was his downfall. But by Mordechai it says 'and he returned/repented' as written above. Furthermore it is apparent that Mordechai knew that HaShem, may He be blessed, will certainly help the Jewish people as it is written \"relief and deliverance\" etc. And so it's written \"and he knew all that had happened\" etc. However through this way, that all tzadikim {righteous}, that even though they know of the salvation, nevertheless they are able to cry out with a truly complete heart as if they didn't know. And someone that isn't {on that level}, the true salvation isn't shown to him. And this is dependent on complete faith that one nullifies his intellect to HaShem, may He be blessed, and he knows and believes that there is no contradiction in any of this, that the salvation arrives through the outcry of man. Even though HaShem, may He be blessed, will not forsake the Jewish people, without question. Nevertheless it is necessary to cry out in a time of distress as it is written \"a time of distress\" etc. and from that, one will be saved."

All of corporeality derives from there. Previously, they were in a spiritual state, as is said of the future. At the giving of the Torah, too, Israel were ready for this state. That is why it says of Moses that the skin of his face shone. (Exodus 34:29) He so redeemed \"skin\" that he was lit up through the shining speculum. But we did not remain at that rung. Therefore, the afflictions reappeared; the Midrash teaches that it was sin that made us again impaired. It is also known, however, that the skin is porous, containing many tiny holes. These allow the light to shine through its \"shells.\" Only sin clogs up those pores, so that \"darkness covers the earth.\" (Isaiah 60:2) That is why \"the leprous affliction\" is translated [into Aramaic] as <i>segiru</i> or \"closing.\" Now we also understand why the purification rites are assigned to Aaron and his sons the priests; it was they who set right the sin of the Golden Calf."

Rather the Bnei Yisroel need to sanctify all their actions to cleave to the source of the life-force and to take from it life-force. Because the action needs to be only for the purpose that man 'walks' in the service of HaShem (may He be blessed) and simple Jews are directed to eat and drink to add strength in their service of the Creator which is also a general (form of) 'walking'. And what also of the righteous that all their actions are for the sake of Heaven, and so too with every commandment that a person does, it needs to be directed (one should perform it with the intent) that through this (the performance of the commandment) he will come to greater holiness that he could add at all times from one (spiritual) level to the next (spiritual) level.

It is not only praise of Israel, but it is also true testimony to the Creator… There are always levels of servant and child, servant and child, in that the greater one’s grasp of the secrets of the King [as G-d’s child], the more one lowers one’s self to accept the yoke of Heaven as a servant. Consequently, one merits to see and grasp, as a child, and then one returns to being a servant… In Nisan, we become free and receive the yoke of Heaven. All the days of the Sefirah, we are like servants, doing His will, until we achieve seven complete weeks, which is the oath we swore and in which we have stood since Mount Sinai. We then merit on Shavuot to receive the Torah, like children who search through the vaults of the king. However, we then return to being servants, which is Sukkot, when we return and repent on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, and accept the yoke of Heaven anew, which is the glory mentioned above, as the Holy One finds glory in them…Similarly, daily, one accepts the yoke of Heaven [as a servant] in the morning and thereby merits Torah [as a child] according to his level.

                    "13": "Now what emerges is the reason that Israel wished to hear the first two commandments from God Himself: to believe the truth of God as the lifeforce of every human being. As it says “I am the Lord your God”--literally, all of your lifeforce. That’s why it is addressed to the second person singular, for the innermost life force of every Jew is is the same point which gives life to all of creation as it is says “You ‘give life’ to all things”. Thus our Sages taught: A person should always see themselves as if the Holy Presence abides in one’s insides.”, for a holy person should be able to uncover the holy presence within themselves. A person doesn’t create something new by some sort of deed, rather she reveals the innermost life force within her as it says “And He breathed into his mouth life breath”. If a person can believe in this life force, to not forget about it,  and always strive to cleave to the root of this life force, they can merit the “truth by means of trust”, mentioned above. ",

This is as it says (Gen. R.), \"B'reishit -- for the sake of Israel which is called 'reishit.'\" The meaning is that \"reishit\" is the beginning and the inner essence, as it says (Prov.), \"The 'reishit' of wisdom is the awe of God.\" Therefore it is called the Day of Bikkurim, when the fruit is ripe. But B'nai Yisrael \"are excepted from the generality in order to teach to the entire generality\" (Sifra, principles of R' Yishma'el), as it will be in the future (Zeph. 3:9), \"For then I will make the peoples pure of speech, etc. [so that they all invoke Adonai by name and serve Him with one accord].\" And then (Eccl. 7:8) \"The end of a matter is better than the beginning of it\" [see Ruth 3:10]. And in truth, according as B'nai Yisrael elevate from the nations, they are themselves exalted even more. And this itself is the meaning of putting \"na'aseh\" before \"nishma,\" for B'nai Yisrael understood this, that they were chosen in order to draw everyone near, and they said (Ex. 24:7), \"Everything that Adonai has spoken we will do.\" It is written here \"na'aseh\" and it is written there (Gen. 1:26), \"Na'aseh adam,\" as it says (Gen. 12:5) \"the souls that they had made,\" which Onkelos translated \"that they had subjugated to the Torah\", and it is through this that \"we will hear.\" As it is with the particular -- as the improvement [tikkun] of the deeds, in order to draw each physical deed close to the spirit so that the soul shines in the person -- so it is in general -- as the improvement [tikkun] of K'lal Yisrael to draw near from the nations, so that the Torah shines in them. It is written (Micah 7:20), \"You will give truth to Ya'akov, hesed to Avraham,\" for B'nai Yisrael are in truth God's portion and His Torah, but it is also part of the aspect of Truth to do hesed, to bring near those who are far off and who come for the sake of Heaven: \"truth to Ya'akov\" is the Torah, \"hesed to Avraham\" is that we should draw close also from the descendants of Lot -- Ruth the Moabite...."
