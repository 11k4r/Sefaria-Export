                "0": "‘So said the Lord: I will return to Zion,’ My intention is to return to Zion in order that My Presence be established there as it was before. Also ‘and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem’ among the people, that My Presence be within them and that prophecy, holiness and all the desirable things which they had in days of old return to them. However, this is on condition – if Jerusalem will be called the city of truth because of the true justice they will administer there between people and the truth and faithfulness with which they speak, and if the mountain of the Lord of Hosts is called the holy mountain because its priests are sanctified to their Gd. I already mentioned above in Zechariah 7:3 in the name of R’ Yitzchak Abravanel that Israel was afraid then that they would be once again sent into exile because of seven things and this prophecy comes to remove them one by one, as the Rav explained. On the first source of concern, which was the fear they felt once they saw that the Divine Presence did not return to the Second Temple, the prophet said that it is possible He will return His Presence to Zion if they improve their actions, to do what is true and to walk in holiness."
