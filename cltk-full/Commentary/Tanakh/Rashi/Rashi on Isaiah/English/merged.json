The Lord will there, great for us, and the city will be a place of rivers and stream as it says \"And he measured one thousand, a stream that I could not cross...\" (Ezekiel 47:5) So too Yoel prophesied \"...and a spring shall emanate from the house of the Lord...\" (Yoel 4:18) This is the river which will progressively increase."

Yonatan translates 'your walls' as the forefathers who guard us like a wall."
