Moshe rebuked B'nei Yisrael close to his death while he was already revered in their eyes, with the many miracles that he did for them: took them out of Egypt, split the sea for them, brought down the Manna, brought them the slav (some say this is a quail), gave them the Torah, and brought up the well. And here, I am going to rebuke them at the beginning of my mission?!"

Yaakov worked for me for many years and at the end my sister went under the Chuppah and married my husband. And I remained quiet.
