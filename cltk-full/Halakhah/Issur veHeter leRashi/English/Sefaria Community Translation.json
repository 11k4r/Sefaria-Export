And in the first measure that He finds, makes the blessing: Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who sanctified us with His commandments, and His desire for the elimination of chametz. And he goes and searches here and there. When he finishes checking and he comes to stash away food, two meals before him, he nullifies by the saying of covering of the eye, as it is written Return light to your houses. \"All Chametz that is now in my house is adjudged as if it was burned, nullified and as if as dust\". There are many great laws using this language, \"All chametz in my household and I do not know about it to nullify it, is rendered as dust\". And this is the essence. "
