And everybody who is able to wake up in the middle of the night, he should do it and say \"Tikkun Hasot\". And also, if you remain awake until the middle of the night, try not to sleep until you say Tikkun Hasot, to join with the pain of the Shekhinah in exile. However, when you pray and learn Torah you should be happy. And in any case, if you cry during the prayer, you prayer is accepted more."

And even if his fellow does not know of the theft that was taken from him, one still has to return what was stolen and appease him. [Yalkut Yosef Moadim pg. 78.
