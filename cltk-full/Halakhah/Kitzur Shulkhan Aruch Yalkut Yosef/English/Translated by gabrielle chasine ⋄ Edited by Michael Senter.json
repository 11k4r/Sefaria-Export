And therefore one should power-up like a lion to stand in the morning to serve Hashem, like you awaken the dawn. No matter what one shouldn't be late to the time of of prayers or the time of saying SHEMA ISRAEL. [The main strengthening  should be in the heart to, to overcome his will to win it, like a powerful man overpowers his hater and wins him and drops him to the earth. This is how one should fight is evil inclination, like a lion, get up from his sleep to server hashem ]. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 57). And never the less, that one who does a mitzvah, he should not be embarrassed from those who make fun of him, and anyway don't quarrel with them and fight the them, in order that he wouldn't get used to the trait of boldness which is very improper. And if his aim is to influence the eyes of the community in the matter of Torah or Mitzvot, and he tried already the way of peace but wasn't successful, then he is allowed to bolden himself to fight with them to defeat their wrong thoughts."
