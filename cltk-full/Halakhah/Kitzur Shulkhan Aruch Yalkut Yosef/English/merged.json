Rather, he should put forth his claims with truth and simplicity before an established Rabbi, asking him to rule whether or not he is obligated to return money to his fellow. And even if his fellow is not bringing him to court, he is still obligated to fulfill his obligation towards heaven by asking a Torah scholar who is an expert decision-maker, as it is written (Mishna Avot Ch.1) \"Make for yourself a Rabbi and avoid doubt\". And even if his fellow does not know of the theft that was taken from him, one still has to return what was stolen and appease him. [Yalkut Yosef Moadim pg. 78.

And everybody who is able to wake up in the middle of the night, he should do it and say \"Tikkun Hasot\". And also, if you remain awake until the middle of the night, try not to sleep until you say Tikkun Hasot, to join with the pain of the Shekhinah in exile. However, when you pray and learn Torah you should be happy. And in any case, if you cry during the prayer, you prayer is accepted more."

The Torah that they toil in protects the generation, when they're not learning calamity comes to the world. Additionally in the Gemara it says that scholars that toil in Torah during the night, the Torah considered it as if they're involved in the sacrificial services. They also said, in the Jerusalem Talmud someone who is working the Torah in modesty (at night where nobody can see him) he does not forget his learning quickly. And Maimonides wrote: Even though it's a mitzvah to learn night and day, a person learns most of his wisdom at night. Therefore, if someone wants to merit the crown of Torah, he should be careful every single night, not to waste is on sleeping, eating and idle chatter, rather it should be with Torah and words of wisdom.",
