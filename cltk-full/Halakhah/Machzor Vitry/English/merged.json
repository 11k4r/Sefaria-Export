                "0": "The story is told of Rabbi Akiva who was walking in a cemetery and came across a naked man who was dark as coal and carrying a huge load of sticks on his head. Thinking that he was alive, Rabbi Akiva asked how he had gotten into the situation of needing to do such difficult work, and offering to go to any means necessary to redeem him. The man asked Rabbi Akiva to get out of his way. \"What's the story here\", asked Rabbi Akiva. \"I'm actually dead\", the man replied, \"and every day they send me to cut down trees.\"",
                "1": "\"What was your job when you were alive\", Rabbi Akiva asked. \"I was a tax collector\", the man replied, \"and I would favor the wealthy and kill the poor.\"",
                "2": "Rabbi Akiva asked him, \"“Haven’t you heard anything from those",
                "3": "appointed to punish you about how you might be relieved?”",
                "4": "“I did hear from [those appointed over me] one impossible thing\", he replied. \"They told me the only way to get out of this situation is if I had a son who stood up in the minyan and declared \"Barchu et Hashem Hamevorach\", and they answer after him, \"Yehei Shmei Rabah Mevorach\". If that were to happen, I would immediately be released from this punishment. I didn't have a son, but I left behind a pregnant wife. I don't know if she gave birth to a son. If she did give birth to a son, who would possibly teach this son Torah, since nobody in the world liked me?\"",
                "5": "Immediately, Rabbi Akiva decided that he would go search and see if the man did in fact have a son who he could teach Torah and teach to lead prayers.\"",
                "6": "Rabbi Akiva asked the man who was being punished, \"What's your name?\", and the man answered, \"Akiva\". He asked him, \"What's your wife's name?\", and he answered \"Shoshbina\". He asked \"Where are you from?\", and the man responded, \"Ludkia\". ",
                "7": "Immediately Rabbi Akiva put himself through great difficulty to find the man's family. When he made it to the town, he asked about the man. \"May that man's bones erode\", the people responded. He asked about the man's wife. \"May her memory be wiped out for all time\", they said. He asked about the child. They responded, \"He isn't even circumcised\". Rabbi Akiva immediately circumcised the boy. Rabbi Akiva put a book in front of the boy, but the boy couldn't learn anything until Rabbi Akiva fasted for 40 days. ",
                "8": "A heavenly voice emerged, asked, \"You're fasting on behalf of this kid?\" Rabbi Akiva responded, \"Master of the Universe, have I not prepared him before you?\"",
                "9": "Immediately, God opened up the boy's heart, and he was able to learn Torah, the Shema and Birkat Hamazon (the grace after meals). Rabbi Akiva stood him up in front of the community to recite Barchu, and they recited, \"Baruch Hashem Hamevorach\". Immediately, they released the boy's father from his punishment. ",
                "10": "Immediately, the boy's father came to Rabbi Akiva in a dream, saying to him, \"May it be God's well that you rest for all time in the Garden of Eden, for you saved me from the punishment of Gehennom. Rabbi Akiva responded with a verse from Psalms, \"God's name is forever, God's memory passes from generation to generation.\"",

                "0": "1 What is an open paragraph (parasha petuha)? Anything which is written from the start of the line to its middle, or to a third of the way through; or so that there is space to write three words of three letters, that is, lemishpahoteikhem. That is a petuha. And if it happens that the end of the verse is at the end of the line, with less than the required space, he leaves a second blank line and starts the new paragraph on the third line; that is also a petuha. A closed paragraph (setuma): when there is writing at both ends of the line and a blank space in the middle, sufficient to write two letters or more. That is a setuma. A sedura paragraph: when the line is written to the middle or a third of the way through, and then he leaves the rest blank, and restarts on the next line, directly below where he left off in the line above. That is a sedura. This I found in an old siddur. ",
                "1": "2 Masekhet Soferim has different definitions: a petuha is anything which  does not start at the head of the line. A setuma is anything that stops in the middle of the line. How much must be left at the beginning of the line for it to be called a petuha? Enough to write a word of three letters. How much must be left in the middle of the line for it to be called a setuma? Enough to write a word of three letters. [End Masekhet Soferim quote.] Suppose he finished a paragraph at the edge of the page and started a new line, and left enough space at the beginning of that line to write three letters, and then started to write? Come and learn from the two sources; the baraita gives the essence of the issue. The baraita reasons that the beginning of the line is what determines a petuha, not the end of the line [so the example case is a petuha according to the baraita]; if one leaves a gap at the beginning and also at the end of the line, it is still a petuha. But the old siddur reasons that it is the end of the line that determines a petuha, not the beginning of the line [so the example case is a setuma according to the baraita]. [To avoid ambiguity, therefore...] if he makes a petuha with space both at the end of the line and at the beginning of the line it is good for both of them. This is correct. There is also another order of petuhot and setumot which seems entirely unconvincing. And these are the tagin of a sefer Torah and the petuhot and setumot according to the masoretic tradition. ביה שמו: the following words should be placed at the beginning of a line and the top of a column: Bereshit (Gen. 1:1); Yehudah ata yodukha (Gen. 49:8); Haba-im ahareihem bayam (Ex. 14:28); Shemor ve-shamarta (Deut. 12:28); Motza sefateikha (Deut. 23:24); Ve-a'ida bam (Deut. 31:28).",
