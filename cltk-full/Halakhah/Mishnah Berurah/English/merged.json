Immediately upon waking up from sleep if he doesn't plan to sleep more, he should wash his hands, even if he is does so while still lying down. All the more so, he shouldn't walk four cubits without having washed his hands. He must be very careful in this regard. And the holy Zohar emphasizes the great punishment for this, for leaving the spirit of impurity on himself. In any case, he should not God forbid violate any other prohibition in order to not have a gap before washing his hands; like for instance, to stop himself from urinating for this purpose, or to take water which his friend had prepared for himself, if its not obvious to him that he will immediately be able to give him other [water] in exchange. And there are those who fail in this. And if he sees that the water is far and he doesn't have someone to bring it close to him, it is the custom of some of the observant ones (ba'alei ha'nefesh) to walk little by little in increments shorter than four cubits. The Sha'arei Teshuvah write about this that its better if hes able to run and not allow the spirit of evil to linger on his hands. There are those who say in regards to this idea that the entire house is like his four cubits, but we shouldn't rely on this unless in a time of pressure. If when he arises at night he sees that he does not have enough water to wash his hands three times as it appropriate to rid the spirit of impurity, nevertheless he should not God forbid forgo his Torah study because of this until daylight, but rather he should wash his hands a little or clean his hands on whatever he has to wash, make a blessing, and learn, as per the law of the Talmud and Torah.
