Outside of the land, one would not purchase from anyone unless they had a reputation for upholding the laws of <i>kashrut</i>. Nowadays, in all places wine is not taken from anyone without such a reputation. And so it is with regards to meat, cheese and fish without obvious signs.", 
            "25": "One who is a guest in the house of a host, in all places and in all times, and is given wine, meat, cheese or fish - one does not need to investigate further [about the host], even if he is unknown to him, and all he knows is that he is a Jew. If, however, [the host] is reputable for not upholding the laws of <i>kashrut</i> and not applying all its details, it is forbidden to be a guest in his house. And if one nonetheless did come as a guest, one does not eat the meat or drink the wine or trust his word about it, unless another reputable person testifies about it.\n", 
            "6": "A Ger Toshav -- He who has accepted the Seven Mitzvot of the sons of Noah, as we have explained -- it is prohibited to drink his wine, but it is permitted to derive benefit from it. And one may leave wine with him briefly, but not for a long time. And so too any Gentile who does not worship the stars and the constellations, such as the Ishmaelites, their wine may not be drunk, but one may derive benefit from it. And such instructed all the Geonim. But those who worship the stars and the constellations, one may not derive benefit from their wine."

But bread made by ordinary folk, there is nobody who permits it; for the primary purpose of the decree is from intermarriage, and if he eats the bread of ordinary folk, he will end up eating with them.", 
            "8": "And there are other things that the Sages prohibited, even though they are not Biblically prohibited, the Sages decreed upon these in order to distance from the Gentiles such that Israel would not assimilate in them, and intermarry. And the prohibitions are: The prohibited to drink with them, even when we are not worried about libations; and they prohibited eating their bread or dishes that they cooked, even when we are not worried about their \"revulsions\" [i.e. the absorbed taste of non-kosher food in the dishes].

            "21": "In reference to an ox condemned to be stoned it is written: \"Its flesh shall not be eaten\" (Exodus 21:28). How could it be eaten after it had been stoned and assumed the status of <i>nevelah? !</i> Scripture only means to convey that as soon as the ox was condemned to be stoned it became forbidden and was regarded as an unclean animal. If anyone hastened and slaughtered the ox properly, it is forbidden to derive any benefit from it; if anyone ate an olive-size of its flesh he is to be lashed.— —", 
            "1": "The term <i>prohibited nevelah</i> is applicable only to the clean species that are fit for ritual slaughter, and permitted as food if slaughtered properly. Unclean species, on the other hand, where <i>sheḥitah</i> has no advantage, if anyone eats of their flesh he is to be lashed not because of eating <i>nevelah</i> and <i>terefah</i> but for eating the flesh of an unclean animal; and it is immaterial whether it has been slaughtered properly or it has died a natural death, or whether he has cut a piece of flesh from it when alive and eaten it.", 
            "0": "Anyone who eats an olive-size of the flesh of cattle, beasts, or birds that died a natural death should be lashed, as it is written: \"You must not eat anything that has died a natural death\" (Deuteronomy 14:21). Whatever has not been slaughtered properly is regarded as if it died a natural death.— —", 
            "5": "Anyone who eats an olive-size of the flesh of clean cattle, beasts or birds that were declared ritually unfit for food is to be lashed, as it is written: \"You must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs\" (Exodus 22:30). The biblical term <i>terefah</i> refers to an animal torn by a wild beast, such as a lion, a leopard, or the like. So too, <i>terefah</i> is applied to a bird torn by a bird of prey, a hawk, or the like. You cannot say that <i>terefah</i> signifies that the wild beast or bird of prey tore and killed it, since it would be <i>nevelah</i> if dead; what difference does it make whether it died of itself or was killed by someone who struck it with a sword, or whether a lion mauled and killed it? Hence, the biblical text must refer to a mauled animal that has not died.", 
            "7": "From this you may conclude that the Torah has forbidden an animal that has died, a <i>nevelah</i>. It has also forbidden an animal on the verge of death because of its wounds, even though it has not died yet, and that is <i>terefah</i>. Just as you can make no distinction between the causes of death, whether the animal died a natural death or it fell down and died — — so you can make no distinction in the case of an animal on the verge of death, whether a beast tore and mauled it — — or whether someone shot an arrow at it and pierced its heart or lungs.— — Once the animal is dying at any rate, it is <i>terefah</i>, whether the cause is a human act or an act of God. If this is the case, why is the term <i>terefah</i> (torn) mentioned in the Torah? Scripture speaks of what happens regularly. If you will not interpret it in this manner, you will have to assume that it refers only to an animal \"torn … in the field,\" and if it was torn in a courtyard it should not be forbidden! Hence, you must infer that Scripture speaks only of what is likely to happen.", 
            "6": "If a torn animal that has not died is forbidden, one might suppose that if a wolf came and dragged away a young goat by its foot, tail or ear, and a man chased the wolf and rescued the kid from its mouth, the kid should be forbidden because it was mauled, therefore the Torah plainly says: \"You must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs,\" that is, it is forbidden only when it has become fit for the dogs. Hence, you may infer that <i>terefah</i> spoken of in the Torah refers to an animal torn and mauled by a wild beast to the point of death, though it has not died yet. Even if someone hastened to slaughter it prior to its death, it is forbidden as <i>terefah</i>, since it could not have survived the wound inflicted upon it."

            "12": "It therefore is logical that any milk owned by a non-Jew is prohibited, lest they have mixed in the milk of a non-kosher animal. Cheese produced by a non-Jew is permitted, since milk of a non-kosher animal cannot become cheese. However, in the days of the sages, they decreed that cheese produced by a non-Jew be prohibited, lest they coagulate it using the non-kosher stomach lining of animals they slaughter. And if you will say - the stomach-lining is negligible in relation in the amount of milk; should it not be considered nullified? Since it is the very thing which creates the cheese, and if the thing which creates the cheese is prohibited, the whole thing is prohibited, as will be explained.", 
            "15": "It appears to me that if one purchased butter from non-Jews and cooked it until the drops of milk left, it is permitted. If you would say [that drops of non-kosher milk] were mixed with [the butter] and they were all cooked together, [the non-kosher milk drops] would be nullified based on their minimal quantity. But [if] the butter was cooked by non-Jews, it is forbidden because of the leeching of non-Jewish [vessels into food], as will be explained.", 
            "14": "[If] a person eats the cheese of non-Jews or milk that was milked by a non-Jew and no Jew watched him, they give him lashes for rebellious conduct. [Regarding] the butter of non-Jews, some of the Geonim permit it, for [the Sages] did not make a decree against butter, and impure milk [from a non-kosher animal] will not coagulate [into the butter]. But some of the Geonim prohibit it, because of the drops of milk that remain in it. For the whey in the butter is not mixed into the butter in such a way as to be nullified based on its minimal quantity. And we suspect all milk from them [non-Jews], lest it be mixed with the milk of an impure [non-kosher] animal."

Also, one must shake off the salt before rinsing the meat.", 
            "20": "A bowl in which one has salted meat must never be used for hot food, even if the bowl is lined with lead, for the blood has already been absorbed in its potsherds.",

            "6": "If the liver is cut open and thrown into vinegar or boiling water so that it becomes bleached, it is then permitted to be cooked. All the Jewish people have already adopted the custom of singeing it over the fire before cooking it.— —", 
            "9": "Meat cannot be rid of its blood unless it is thoroughly salted and rinsed. How should one proceed? First, he should rinse the meat, and then salt it thoroughly and leave it in the salt for the time it takes to walk a mile. He should then rinse it well again until the water is entirely clear, and immediately throw it into boiling water, but not lukewarm water, that it may become bleached without any blood coming out."

He should be excommunicated and removed from his position. He can never be rehabilitated to enable him to sell meat again, unless he proceeds to a place where the people do not know him, and there restores a lost object of considerable worth, — — thereby proving that he has indeed repented, without any trickery.", 
            "10": "Ten stores: nine sell kosher meat and one sell non-kosher meat, and one takes meat from one of them, but does not know which one the meat was taken from, this [meat] is forbidden, as every established place is like a half of a half [i.e. each established location is treated as its own majority]. But meat that is found thrown in the marketplace, you can follow the majority, as anything separated [is considered to be] separated from the majority. If the majority of sellers are non-Jews, it is forbidden; and if the majority of sellers are Jews, it is permitted."

            "14": "It appears to me that the law of <i>neta revai</i> does not operate outside the land of Israel. Rather, a person may eat the produce of the fourth year without redeeming it at all, as [the Sages] spoke only of <i>orlah</i>. An <i>a fortiori</i> argument [can be made] regarding this: In Syria, [a person] is not obligated in the laws of tithes and the laws of the sabbatical year [apply] by rabbinic decree. Still, the laws of <i>neta revai</i> do not apply, as will be explained in [the section of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> titled] <i>Hilkhot Ma'aser Sheni</i>. [Thus, in other places] outside of Israel [where neither the law of tithes or the laws of the sabbatical year apply], how much the moreso should <i>neta revai</i> not apply. In the land of Israel, however, [these laws] operate whether inside or outside of the Temple. Some of the Geonim taught that <i>kerem revai</i> alone must be redeemed outside of Israel and after that, a person is permitted to eat it. There is no basis [for this geonic teaching].", 
            "17": "Some of the Geonim teach that even if a person redeemed fourth-year produce or \"deconsecrated\" it, it is prohibited to eat it until the arrival of the fifth year. This ruling has no source, and it appears to me that it is an error in [their] instruction. The reason is, as is written [in Lev. 19:25], \"And in the fifth year, you shall eat its produce.\" The only intent of this written [verse] is that in the fifth year, you shall eat its produce without redeeming it like all other non-consecrated [produce] in the world. It is not appropriate [for a person] to take this teaching into consideration."

            "1": "The reason Scripture is silent, and does not explicitly prohibit the eating of meat with milk, is that it has already forbidden the cooking; that is to say, since the cooking of the meat-milk mixture is forbidden, it is needless to state that partaking of it is likewise forbidden. Similarly, Scripture is silent and does not explicitly prohibit taking one's own daughter to wife, having already prohibited the taking of one's granddaughter to wife.",

So too, anyone who eats of both the meat and the milk that have been cooked together, [even as little as] the size of an olive, is to be lashed, even if he has not done the cooking himself.", 
            "3": "So too, the meat of beast or bird cooked with the milk of beasts or cattle is biblically not prohibited from eating; hence, it is permissible to cook it and to derive a benefit from it. It is, however, prohibited from eating it on rabbinic grounds, so that the people may not reach out beyond what is permitted and transgress the biblical meat-milk prohibition by eating the meat of a clean animal with the milk of a clean animal, since the literal meaning of the verse is restricted to a kid in its mother's milk only. For this reason, the sages have prohibited all meat with milk.",

The phrase \"a kid in its mother's milk\" is used only because Scripture speaks of something that actually happens. But if one cooks the meat of a clean animal with the milk of an unclean animal, or the meat of an unclean animal with the milk of a clean animal, he is permitted to do so and derive a benefit from it as well; punishment is incurred for eating it, but not by reason of its being a meat-milk mixture."
