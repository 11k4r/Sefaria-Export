            "11": "12. When a person purchases a slave from a gentile without making a stipulation beforehand, and the slave does not desire to be circumcised or to accept the mitzvot incumbent upon slaves, he is given leeway for twelve months. If at the end of this period, he still does not desire, the master must sell him to a gentile or to the diaspora. If the slave made a stipulation with the master at the outset that he did not have to circumcise himself, the owner may maintain him as a gentile for as long as he desires and may sell him to a gentile or the diaspora. Similarly, even when a slave who has been circumcised and immersed himself to become a slave, but afterwards caused himself to be captured by a group of brigands, if his master cannot expropriate him - neither through the laws of the Jews, nor through the laws of the gentiles - he may accept payment for him from the gentile and formalize the sale through the gentile authorities, for he is preserving his money from the gentiles.", 
            "10": "11. This slave who fled to Eretz Yisrael is a righteous gentile. Scripture adds a specific warning for anyone who would desire to deride him, for he is even more humble-spirited than a convert. Therefore, Scripture Deuteronomy 23:17 issues a command with regard to him: \"He shall dwell with you, in your midst, in one of your cities that he desires. You shall not abuse him.\" Abusing him refers even to verbal derision. Thus, a person who derides this convert transgresses three negative commandments: \"A person should not abuse his colleague\" (Leviticus 25:14), \"Do not abuse a convert\" (Exodus 22:20), and \"You shall not abuse him.\" He also transgresses the commandment: \"Do not oppress him\" (Exodus, Ibid.), as explained with regard to the laws of ona'ah.", 
            "13": "14. The following rules apply when a slave who was imprisoned flees from jail. If his master despaired of regaining ownership of him, he is granted his freedom. His master is compelled to compose a bill of release for him.", 
            "12": "13. When a person declares a slave ownerless, the slave is granted his freedom. A bill of release must be composed for him. If the master who declared him ownerless dies, his heir should compose the bill of release.", 
            "15": "16. If a master makes a slave an apotiki for his creditor and then frees the slave, the slave is freed. We also compel the creditor to free him as well. This is a measure enacted for the correction of society, lest the creditor encounter the slave at a later time and say: \"You are my slave.\"", 
            "14": "15. The following rules apply when a slave is taken captive by gentiles. If his first master despaired of regaining ownership of him, anyone who redeems him with the intent that he remain a slave may subjugate him, and he becomes his property. If he redeemed him with the intent that he become free, he is granted his freedom. If the slave's first owner did not despair of regaining ownership, a person who redeems the slave with the intent that he remain a slave should take back the money he spent to redeem him from his owner, and the slave is returned to his original owner. If he redeemed him with the intent of freeing him, he is returned to his original owner without any payment.", 
            "17": "18. It is forbidden for a person to teach his slave Torah. If he teaches him, he is not granted his freedom.", 
            "16": "17. When a master marries his slave to a free woman, places tefillin on his head, or tells him to read three verses from a Torah scroll in public, or the like - i.e., matters in which only a freed person is obligated - he is considered to be free. We compel his master to compose a bill of release for him. Similar rules apply when the slave took a vow that we compel slaves to fulfill, as we have stated with regard to vows, and instead of compelling him, his master said: \"The vow is annulled.\" Since he did not compel him in a situation in which he should have compelled him, he indicated that he was concluding his subjugation of him. From this, I conclude that if a person frees a slave while speaking in any language and utters statements that indicate that his intent is that he does not retain any authority over him at all, and he has resolved to accept this step, he cannot retract. We compel him to write a bill of release even though he has not written one already. If, however, a person borrows money from his slave, makes him a guardian, the slave puts on tefillin in his master's presence, or reads three verses in the synagogue in his master's presence, and his master does not rebuke him, he does not obtain his freedom.", 
            "19": "20. If a Jew seizes possession of a gentile who was a minor, or finds a gentile child and has him immersed with the intent that he become a convert, he becomes a convert. If his intent was that the gentile become a slave, he becomes a slave. If his intent was that he become a free man, he becomes a free man.", 
            "18": "19. f a person purchases a slave from a gentile, and the slave takes the initiative and immerses himself with intent of becoming free in the presence of his master, he attains his freedom. If he does this outside his master's presence, he must explicitly state his intent. Accordingly, the slave's master must push him into the water.", 
            "20": "21. When the slaves and maid-servants of a convert take the initiative and immerse themselves in his presence, they attain their freedom.", 
            "1": "2. The following rules apply when a person borrows money from a gentile and offers a slave as collateral. If the borrower fixed a time and told the gentile: \"If this and this date arrives and I have not paid you, you acquire the body of this slave,\" the slave must be released immediately. If he told him: \"Acquire the proceeds of his work,\" the slave is not released. If the gentile expropriated the slave as payment for the debt, or attackers came upon the master and sought to kill him, and he redeemed himself from them by giving them his slave, the slave is not freed, for he was taken from his master against his will.", 
            "0": "1. When a person sells his slave to a gentile, the slave is released as a free man. We compel the previous owner to buy him back from the gentiles at even ten times his value. He then composes a bill of release for him, and the slave is released. If the gentile purchaser does not desire to sell the slave back at even ten times his value, we do not require the owner to make another offer. This fine is only collected and brought to judgment in a court of expert judges. If the seller dies, we do not require his heir to return the slave so that he can free him.", 
            "3": "4. In the following instances - a person sold his slave to a gentile for 30 days, sold him except for his work, sold him except for the mitzvot, or sold him except for the Sabbaths and festivals - there is an unresolved question whether the slave is free or not. Therefore, if the slave seizes property belonging to his former master that equals his worth, so that he can purchase his freedom from the gentile, it is not expropriated from him.", 
            "2": "3. If a person sells his slave to one of the servants of a king or his officers, despite the fact that the seller fears them, the slave receives his freedom. For he could have appeased them with other money.", 
            "5": "6. When a person living in Eretz Yisrael sells his slave to a master from the diaspora, the slave is granted his freedom. We compel his new master to compose a bill of release for him, and his money is forfeited. Why did our Sages penalize the purchaser alone in this instance? Because if he had not purchased the slave, this slave would not have left Eretz Yisrael for the diaspora. Selling a slave to Syria or to Acre is considered as selling him to the diaspora.", 
            "4": "5. Whether a Jew sells his slave to a gentile who serves idols, a ger toshav, or even to a kuti, the slave is granted his freedom. If he sells his slave to an apostate Jew, there is an unresolved question regarding the matter. Therefore, if the slave seizes property belonging to his former master that equals his worth, so that he can purchase his freedom from the apostate, it is not expropriated from him.", 
            "7": "8. When a slave follows his master to Syria, and his master sells him there, the slave is considered to have forfeited his privilege. When does the above apply? When his master took him to the diaspora with the intent not to return to Eretz Yisrael. If, however, his master's intent was to return, and the slave followed him with that intent, should the master sell him there, he is granted his freedom, and we compel the purchaser to release him.", 
            "6": "7. here is an unresolved question when an inhabitant of Babylonia marries a woman in Eretz Yisrael with the intent of returning to Babylonia, and the woman brings slaves and maid-servants to his household. There is a doubt whether they are considered as having been sold to the diaspora, for the husband has the right to the fruits of their labor, or they are not considered as having been sold to him, since their physical person belongs to the woman.", 
            "9": "10. When a slave flees from the diaspora to Eretz Yisrael, he should not be returned to slavery. Concerning such a person, the Torah Deuteronomy 23:16 states: \"Do not return a slave to his master.\" His master is told to compose a bill of release for him, and he writes a promissory note for his master for his worth, which the master holds until the freed slave earns that money and gives it to him. If the master does not desire to free him, the court invalidates his ownership of him, and the slave is free to go on his way.", 
            "8": "9. When a slave asks his master to move to Eretz Yisrael, we compel his master to move there with him or to sell him to someone who is moving there. When a master living in Eretz Yisrael desires to move to the diaspora, he cannot compel the slave to move with him against his will. This law applies in all times, even in the present era, when the land is ruled by gentiles."
