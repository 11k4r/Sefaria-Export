The sages have reported a case where a tenth person drank and died, since the poison of a snake sinks to the bottom. There is a poison of venomous reptiles that floats on the top and another that remains suspended in the liquid. For this reason, all of it is forbidden, even if the liquid has been passed through a strainer. So too, if nine ate of an uncovered melon and did not die, let not a tenth person eat of it.",

The intent of the verse is that whenever a person intends to strike a colleague with a blow that could kill him, the pursued should be saved by \"cutting off the hand\" of the rodef. If this cannot be done, the victim should be saved by taking the rodef's life, as the verse continues: \"you may not show pity.\"", 
            "6": "What is implied? If the rodef was warned and continues to pursue his intended victim, even though he did not acknowledge the warning, since he continues his pursuit he should be killed. If it is possible to save the pursued by damaging one of the limbs of the rodef, one should. Thus, if one can strike him with an arrow, a stone or a sword, and cut off his hand, break his leg, blind him or in another way prevent him from achieving his objective, one should do so. If there is no way to be precise in one's aim and save the person being pursued without killing the rodef, one should kill him, even though he has not yet killed his victim. This is implied by Deuteronomy 25:11-12, which states: \"If a man is fighting with his brother, and the wife of one... grabs the attacker by his private parts, you must cut off her hand; you may not show pity.\"", 
            "8": "This, indeed, is one of the negative mitzvot - not to take pity on the life of a rodef. On this basis, our Sages ruled that when complications arise and a pregnant woman cannot give birth, it is permitted to abort the fetus in her womb, whether with a knife or with drugs. For the fetus is considered a rodef of its mother. If the head of the fetus emerges, it should not be touched, because one life should not be sacrificed for another.
