A proof to this matter is what is stated in the Torah: (Shemot 34:25) \"Do not slaughter the animal with hametz in your possession.\" This means to say do not slaughter [the korban pesach] while the hametz exists. The day of the slaughtering the korban pesach is the 14th day following midday.",

In addition, it is a Rabbinic injuction to search and destroy hametz on the night of the 14th using a candlelight, since people are usually home and the candle is excellent for searching. One should not establish his learning at the end of the 13th day. The Hacham should not begin to study at this time lest he is drawn, thereby preventing him from searching for hametz at the beginning of this time."

And if one boiled water a lot and afterwards put flour into it, indeed this is permitted because it is cooked instantly before it can leaven.
