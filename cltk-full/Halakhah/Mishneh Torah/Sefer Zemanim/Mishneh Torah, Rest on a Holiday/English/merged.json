A calf that was born on Yom Tov- if it's mother was going to be used for meat- it is permitted [to slaughter the calf and eat it on Yom Tov] because the animal is considered to be prepared [for Yom Tov] because of its mother's [status] and if one were to slaughter it's mother while it was still inside- it is permitted to eat [the fetus inside] even though it was not born.",

A Bechor that falls into a pit- make for it provisions [so that it will not die] because one is not able to bring it up because it it not considered to be fit for slaughter on Yom Tov. [If] it and it's child were to fall into a pit- He should bring up the animal on condition to slaughter it and not do so and be cunning and bring up the second one on [the same] condition to slaughter and slaughter either one he wishes. Because of animal suffering it is permitted to use cunning.

Therefore it is prohibited for one to examine blemishes on Kadshim animals on Yom Tov because it is a [rabbinic] decree lest a sage permit [Kadshim animals] with blemishes [to be slaughtered for personal use] and he [the owner] will come to slaughter it on that day [on Yom Tov].

Those who reside in Eretz Yisrael, however, observe only <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> for two days. In the section of this book concerning the rules of the Hebrew calendar, we shall explain the principle of this custom as well as the reason why <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is celebrated for two days everywhere.",

An egg  that was laid on the first can be eaten on the second. A wild animal and a bird that were trapped on the first can be eaten on the second. Something connected to the ground that was uprooted on the first can be eaten on the second. And similarly, it is permitted to blue an eye on the second festival day, even though there is no sickness there. These words apply to the two festival days of the diaspora, but the two days of New Year are one instance of holiness, and are considered like one day for all of these things, except only for the matter of the deceased. But, an egg that was laid on the first day of New Year is forbidden on the second, and similarly for all similar cases. If Sabbath was adjacent to a festival day, and an egg was laid on one of them, it is forbidden on the other, and similarly for all similar cases.

This does not include the prohibition against conveying objects from one domain to another, and the prohibition against starting a fire on the Sabbath. Since the transfer of objects from one domain to another has been made permissible for the purpose of preparing food, it has been made permissible even for purposes other than food preparation.— — So too, it is permissible to start a fire on a holyday even when it is not needed for the preparation of food. Other acts, however, are permissible on a holyday only when they are needed for the preparation of food; for example: slaughtering, baking, kneading, and the like. — —",

Why then have they not prohibited it? In order to increase the festive rejoicing. One may therefore carry to and fro whatever he pleases, performing all that he has to do, without being like one whose hands are tied.— —",

Why have they enacted this prohibition? It has been enacted in order to prevent one from postponing the performance of tasks until the day of the festival, with the result that the whole day would be spent in performing these tasks, without having time to enjoy the festival or to eat."

We have already addressed the ideas of honor and delight in the laws of the Sabbath. It is therefore fitting for a person to refrain from feasting on the eve of festivals from the time of minha just as we do on Sabbath eve as this is part of obligation of honoring.

While eating and drinking, one must feed the stranger, the orphan, the widow, and other poor unfortunates. Anyone, however, who locks the doors of his courtyard and eats and drinks along with his wife and children, without giving anything to eat and drink to the poor and the desperate, does not observe a religious celebration but indulges in the celebration of his stomach.— —",

Although the festivity mentioned here refers to the peace-offering, as we are about to explain in the section concerning the rules of the pilgrim-offering, it includes the appropriate rejoicing of each man and his children and the members of his household.",

Hence, it is called the <i>eruv</i> of dishes.", 
            "0": "On a holyday occurring on a Friday, one must not bake or cook food for the next day, the Sabbath. This prohibition is on rabbinic grounds, to prevent one from cooking on a holyday for a plain weekday. It stands to reason: if one must not cook food for the Sabbath, he certainly must not cook for a plain weekday. Accordingly, it is permissible to cook and bake on a holyday for the Sabbath if on the day preceding the festival one prepared a dish upon which to depend. The dish upon which he depends is called <i>eruv tavshilin</i> [a mingling of dishes designed for the Sabbath as well as for the immediately preceding holyday].",
