            "10": "A girl of 12 years and one day [i.e. 12 complete years] and a boy of 13 years and one day who have grown two [pubic] hairs are considered adults for all commandments and are Biblically obligated to complete the fast. But if they did not grow two hairs, they are still [considered] minors and are only rabbinically obligated to complete the fast. A child under 9 is not afflicted on the Day of Atonement so that he does not come to be endangered.", 
            "1": "Whether one eats permitted foods or forbidden foods, such as sacrificial meat that was slaughtered with the intent to eat it after the designated timeframe, sacrificial meat that was [actually] left over past the time frame, untithed food, meat from an unslaughtered [or improperly slaughtered] animal, meat from an animal with a mortal defect, forbidden fat, or blood, seeing as he ate foods fitting for human consumption, he is liable to excision for eating on the Day of Atonement. ", 
            "0": "One who eats on the Day of Atonement foods fitting for human consumption of the size of a thick date which is slightly smaller than an egg, is liable. All foods combine to this measure. Similarly, one who drinks beverages fitting for human drinking of the [full] volume of the cheek of the drinker--each drinker according to his cheek--is liable. How much is the [full] volume of his cheek? It is such that if he pushed [the liquid] to one side, it looks like his cheek is full. This measure in an average person is less than a revi'it [specific unit of volume]. All beverages combine to this measure, but eating and drinking do not combine to one measure.", 
            "3": "If one ate a small amount and then ate again, if the time that elapsed between the beginning of the first eating and the end of the second eating was less than the time it takes to eat three eggs, they combine to the measure, and if not, they do not combine to the measure. If one drank a small amount and then drank again, if the time that elapsed between the beginning of the first drinking and the end of the second drinking was less than the time it takes to drink a revi'it, they combine to one measure, and if not, they do not combine [to one measure].", 
            "2": "If one ate or drank less than this measure, he is not liable to excision [because] although [consuming] a partial measure is Biblically forbidden, people are not liable to excision except for a [full] measure. And one who eats or drinks a partial measure receives rabbinic lashes.", 
            "5": "If one drank vinegar diluted in water, he is liable. If one chews peppercorns or dry ginger and the like, [he] is exempt, but if it was fresh ginger, he is liable. If one ate grape leaves, he is exempt, but if they were grape vines, he is liable. These are grape vines: anything that blooms in the Land of Israel from the New Year until after the Day of Atonement. Beyond that time, they are like wood and [he is] exempt, and so too with similar items.", 
            "4": "If one ate foods that are not fitting for human consumption, such as bitter grasses or foul syrups or drank liquids that are not fitting for human drinking, such as [fish-]broth, fish oil or undiluted vinegar, even if he ate or drank a lot, he is exempt from excision, but receives rabbinic lashes.", 
            "7": "If a patient who is seriously ill asks for food on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, he should be given to eat as he desires, until he says \"enough,\" even though competent physicians say that he does not need any food. If the patient says that he does not require food, and the physician says that he does, he should be fed in accordance with the physician's order, provided that the physician is competent. If one physician says that the patient needs food and another says that he does not, he should be given food.— —", 
            "6": "If one ate roasted meat in salt, the salt combines with the meat [for the measure]. Broth that is on a vegetable combines [with the vegetables] because items prepared with food that are mixed with the food are considered like [the] food. If one was full from gluttonous eating, meaning to say that he ate until he spurned [more] food and ate more than his fill, he is exempt like one who ate foods not fitting for consumption. [This is] because although this food is permitted and fitting for one who is hungry it is not fitting for this one who is as full as he [is].", 
            "9": "A boy of nine years — — should be trained to fast by the hours. For example, if he is used to eat at eight o'clock in the morning, he should be fed at nine; if he is used to eat at nine, he should be fed at ten; the number of hours is to be increased in accordance with the physical strength of the boy. A boy or a girl of eleven should fast the entire day, according to a rabbinical enactment, so as to be trained in the observance of religious duties.", 
            "8": "A pregnant woman who smelled [food and wants to eat it], we whisper in her ear that it is the Day of Atonement. If she calmed down upon being reminded of this, all is well [and we do not feed her]; if not, we feed her until she calms down. So too, we feed one who is struck with extreme hunger until his eyes light up [i.e. he is satiated]. We feed him even unslaughtered animals and [other] non-kosher foods immediately and don't wait until permissible foods can be found."

            "1": "Whenever the penalty for work done willfully on the Sabbath is stoning, the penalty for doing it willfully on <i>Yom Kippur</i> is <i>kareth;</i> whenever the penalty on the Sabbath is a sin-offering, the penalty on <i>Yom Kippur</i> is equally a sin-offering. Anything that must not be done on the Sabbath, though it is not actual work, must not be done on <i>Yom Kippur;</i> if one nevertheless performs it, he receives punishment for disobedience, the same as he would for a similar act on the Sabbath.— — In brief: The only difference between the Sabbath and <i>Yom Kippur</i> in this respect is that the punishment for deliberate work on the Sabbath is stoning, while on <i>Yom Kippur</i> it is <i>kareth</i>.", 
            "0": "There is a positive commandment to rest from labor on the 10th of the seventh month [Tishrei], as it says, \"it shall be a Sabbath of rest for you.\" And anyone who does labor on it has failed to perform a positive commandment and violated a negative commandment, as it says, \"and on the 10th etc. no labor shall be done.\" And for which punishment is he liable for doing labor on this day? If he did it willingly and intentionally, he is liable to [spiritual] excision. If he did it unintentionally, he is obligated to bring a set sin-offering [not one that varies depending on what the sinner can afford].", 
            "3": "Another positive command concerning <i>Yom Kippur</i> requires us to abstain from eating or drinking on that day, as it is written: \"You shall afflict yourselves\" (Leviticus 16:29). According to tradition, self-affliction signifies fasting. Whoever fasts on <i>Yom Kippur</i> fulfills a positive command, and whoever eats or drinks on it breaks a positive command and transgresses a negative command, as it is written: \"Whoever will not abstain and fast on that day shall be cut off\" (Leviticus 23:29).— —", 
            "2": "It is permitted to do kinuv on [detached] vegetables on the Day of Atonement from the afternoon and on. And what is kinuv? That he removes the rotten leaves and trims the rest and prepares the vegetable for eating. So too, it is permitted to crack open nuts and break open pomegranates from the afternoon and on because of the anguish of the soul [i.e. so one won't have to do it after the fast when he is very hungry]. But the people of Shin'ar [Babylonia] and the West [Israel] have already accepted not to do any of these activities on the day of the fast, rather it is like the Sabbath in all of its matters.", 
            "5": "The same as the rabbinically forbidden occupations on <i>Yom Kippur</i> apply to both day and night, so the rabbinical interpretation of <i>affliction</i> applies to both day and night. One must add to <i>Yom Kippur</i> parts of the preceding and following weekdays, as it is written: \"You shall abstain and fast from the sunset of the ninth day\" (Leviticus 23:32), which means: you shall begin fasting and afflicting yourselves from the sunset of the ninth day bordering on the tenth day. So too, at the termination of <i>Yom Kippur</i>, one should prolong the fasting somewhat into the night of the eleventh day of <i>Tishri</i>, as it is written: \"From sunset of the ninth day to sunset of the tenth day you shall keep your Sabbath.\"", 
            "4": "We have also learned from the oral tradition that it is forbidden to wash [one's body], anoint oneself, wear shoes, or have sexual relations on it. And it is a commandment to refrain from all of these [activities] in the same manner that one refrains from eating and drinking, as it says \"a Sabbath of rest,\" a Sabbath for the matter of eating, rest for these [other] matters. One is not liable to excision or an offering except for eating and drinking. But if one washed, anointed, put on shoes, or had relations, he is given rabbinic lashes.", 
            "6": "If women continue eating and drinking until nightfall, because they fail to know the rule about adding part of the weekday to the holyday, we should not protest against their action, lest they come to do so willfully; for it is impossible to assign a policeman to each homestead in order to caution its womenfolk. Hence, leave them alone. It is better to let them act unwittingly rather than willfully. The same applies to all similar cases."

            "1": "One who was dirty with excrement or mud may wash the dirty place in his usual way without worrying [about violating the prohibition]. A woman can heat up one of her hands in water and give bread to a baby. An ill person may wash in his usual way even if he is not in danger [of his life]. All those who are obligated to immerse [in a ritual bath] immerse in their usual way, whether on the Ninth of Av or the Day of Atonement. ", 
            "0": "It is forbidden to wash oneself on the Day of Atonement whether with hot water or with cold water, whether his whole body or a single limb. It is forbidden to put even one's pinky finger into water. However, the king and a bride wash their faces--the bride so she will not be disgraceful to her husband and the king so [people] will see his beauty, as it says, \"your eyes shall see the king in his beauty.\" For how long [after her wedding] is she called a bride? Thirty days.", 
            "3": "It is forbidden to sit on mud that is so wet that a person can put one hand on it and pick up enough moisture to wet his other hand. A person may not fill up an earthenware utensil with water with which to cool off  because the water flows [lit. crawls] from its walls. It is forbidden even with metal utensils for fear of water sprinkling on his flesh. It is permissible to cool oneself with fruits. ", 
            "2": "One who has a seminal emission on the Day of Atonement nowadays: If it is moist, he wipes it with a napkin, and that is enough. If it is dry or [he] became dirty [with it], he washes the dirty places alone and [then] he may pray. It is forbidden for him to wash his whole body or immerse. For one who immerses nowadays is not pure--due to impurity from exposure to dead people [which everyone is assumed to have]--and washing [i.e. immersing] for a seminal emission nowadays is only a custom. And a custom cannot permit something that is forbidden, rather it can only forbid something that is permissible. They [the rabbis] said that one who has a seminal emission on the Day of Atonement immerses only when there was a rule that those who had seminal emissions must immerse [the rule was made at the time of Ezra], and we already explained that this rule was cancelled. ", 
            "5": "One who goes to greet his teacher, father, or one who is wiser than he or to learn in the house of study may cross through water up to his neck and not worry [about violating the prohibition] and perform the mitzva that that he went to perform and return through the water to his place. For if you do not permit him to return, he will not go [in the first place] and will be prevented from doing the mitzva. So too one who is going to guard his fruit may cross through water up to his neck without worrying as long as they do not take their hands out from under the edges of their garments as they would do during the week [for then it looks as though they are carrying their garments which is forbidden on the Day of Atonement].", 
            "4": "A person may take a handkerchief on the eve of the Day of Atonement, soak it in water, squeeze it out a little, and put it under clothes. The next day, he may pass it over his face and not worry [about violating the prohibition] although it is very cold. ", 
            "7": "It is permitted for any person to wear a sandal because of a scorpion or similar [creature] so it will not bite him. A woman who gave birth is permitted to wear a sandal due to cold for thirty days after the birth. An ill person acts in the same way even if he is not in danger.", 
            "6": "It is forbidden to wear shoes and sandals even on one foot. It is permitted to go out with a sandal of cork, rubber, or other similar materials. One may wrap a cloth around his feet and go out with it for the hardness of the earth reaches his feet and he feels as though he is barefoot. Children although they are allowed to eat, drink, wash, and anoint themselves, we prevent them from [wearing] shoes and sandals.", 
            "9": "There are places which have the practice to light a candle on the eve of the Day of Atonement so one will be embarrassed from his wife and not come to have marital relations with her. There are [other] places which have the practice not to light [a candle] lest one see his wife and she will find favor in his eyes and he will come to have relations with her. If the Day of Atonement falls on the Sabbath, everyone must light in all places because the lighting of candles for the Sabbath is a requirement. ", 
            "8": "It is [as] forbidden to anoint part of one's body as [it is to anoint] his whole body whether an anointing of pleasure or otherwise. If he was an ill [person] even not in danger or one who has scabs on head, he may anoint as usual with worrying [about violating the prohibition]."
