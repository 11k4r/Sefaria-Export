            "1": "2 And there is one point in the orbit of the sun - and likewise in the orbits of the other seven stars - at which time the star is all of its light away from the Earth. And this point of the orbit of the sun and of the other seven stars rotates evenly. And its movement every seventy years is approximately one degree. And this point is called the apogee of the sun. Its movement every ten days is one and a half seconds - which is ninety thirds. It comes out that its movement in a hundred days is fifteen seconds, its movement in a thousand days is two parts and thirty seconds and its movement in ten thousand days is twenty-five parts. And it comes out that its movement in twenty-nine days is four seconds and a bit and its movement in an ordered year is fifty-three seconds. We have already said that the base time from which the calculation begins is from the beginning of the Fifth Night, the date of which is the Third of the month of Nissan of the year 4938 from the creation. And the place of the sun in its average movement [from] this base time was at seven degrees, three parts and thirty-two seconds from the [beginning of the] constellation of Aries. Its symbol is 7.3.32. And the place of the sun's apogee [from] this base time was at twenty-six degrees, forty-five parts and eight seconds from the constellation of Gemini. Its symbol is 26.45.8. When you want to know the place of the sun in its average movement at any time you want - take the amount of days from the beginning of the base time until the day you want. And you can arrive at its average movement for those days from the indicators that we have made known. [Then] add everything to the base time and take the sum of each type [of units] with its type. And what comes out is the place of the sun in its average movement for that day. How is this? See that [if] we wanted to know the place of the sun in its average movement from the beginning of Shabbat night, the date of which was the Fourteenth of the month of Tammuz from this year - which is the year of the base time: We found that the amount of days from the day of the base time until the beginning of this day for which we want to know the place of the sun is a hundred days. We took the average movement for one hundred days - which is 98.33.53 - and we added it to the base time - which is 7.3.32. From the calculation, it came out to one hundred and five degrees, thirty-seven parts and twenty-five seconds. Its symbol is 105.37.25. It comes out that its place according to its average movement at the beginning of this night is in the constellation of Cancer at fifteen degrees in it and thirty-seven parts of the sixteenth degree. The average movement that comes out from this calculation will sometimes be precisely at the beginning of the night [and sometimes] an hour before the sunset or an hour after the sunset. And you should not be concerned about this thing regarding the sun in the calculation of the sighting, as we will compensate for this approximation when we calculate the average [movement] of the moon. And you can do like this anytime you want, even after a thousand years: To take the sum of all of the remainders and add it to the base time - and it will come out for you [to] the place of the average [movement]. And likewise can you do this for the average [movement] of the moon and for the average [movement] of each and every star: Once you know how much its movement is for one day and know the base time from which you start - take the sum of its movement for all of the years and days that you want, and add it to base time. And what comes out is its place in its average movement. And likewise can you do this for the apogee of the sun: Add its movement for those days or years to the base time. What comes out is the place of the sun's apogee for that day that you want. And likewise if you want to make another base time from which to start, besides the base time from which we have started in this year - in order that [such a] base time be at the beginning of the [first] year of a specific cycle or at the beginning of one of the centuries - you have permission in your hand [to do so]. And if you want to make the base time from which you start to be in years that have passed before this base date or after several years from this base date, the procedure is known. How is the procedure? You already know the movement of the sun in an ordered year, its movement for twenty-nine days and its movement for one day. And it is well-known that a year the months of which are complete is one day more than an ordered year; and that a year the months of which are lacking is one day less than an ordered [one]. And [regarding] a leap year: If its months would be in their order, it will be thirty days more than a [simple] ordered year. And if its months would be complete, it will be thirty-one days more than an ordered [year]. And if its months would be lacking, it will be twenty-nine days more than an ordered [year]. And once all of these things are known, you may come out with the average movement of the sun for all of the years and days that you want. So you can add to the [original] base time that we made - and you will have the average [place of the movement] for the day that you want from the years to come. [Then] you can make that the base time. Or you can subtract the movement that you have come up with from the base time that we have made - and you will  have the base time that you want from years that have passed. [Then] you can make that average [place of the movement] the base time. And you can do like this for the average [movement] of the moon and the other stars if they be known to you. And it has already been explained that in the same way that you can know the average [movement] of the sun from the days to come, so can you know its average [movement] for every day that you want from the days that have passed.", 
            "0": "1 The average movement of the sun in one day - which is twenty-four hours - is fifty-nine parts (minutes) and nine seconds. Its symbol is 24:59.9. It comes out that its movement in ten days is nine degrees, fifty-one parts and twenty-three seconds. Its symbol is 9.51.23. And it comes out that its movement in a hundred days is ninety-eight degrees, thirty-three parts and fifty-three seconds. Its symbol is 98.33.53. And it comes out that the remainder of its movement in a thousand days - after you remove each [set of] three hundred and sixty degrees, as we explained - is two hundred sixty-five degrees, thirty-eight parts and fifty seconds. Its symbol is 265.38.50. And it comes out that the remainder of its movement in ten thousand days is one hundred and thirty-six degrees, twenty-eight parts and twenty seconds. Its symbol is 136..28.20. And in this way you can multiply and come out with [the sun's] movement for any amount [of time] that you want. And so if you want to make familiar indicators for yourself for its movement in two days, three and four up until ten, you should do [so]. And likewise if you want to make familiar indicators ready for yourself for its movement in twenty days, thirty and forty up until a hundred, you should do [so]. And this is something revealed and known, once you have known the movement of one day. And it is fitting that the average movement of the sun in twenty-nine days and in three hundred and fifty-four days - which is a lunar year at the time when its months are in order, which is called an ordered year - be ready and familiar to you. For when these average movements will be known, this calculation for the sighting of the moon will be easy for you - since there are twenty-nine complete days from the night of one sighting to the night of the next new moon. And likewise for each and every month - there is no less than twenty-nine days and no more. For our desire in all of these calculations is only to know the sighting of the moon exclusively. And likewise from the night of the sighting of this month to the night of the sighting in the same month in the next year is an ordered year or a year and a day. And likewise for each and every year. And the average movement of the sun for twenty-nine days is twenty eight degrees, thirty-five parts and one second. Its symbol is 28.35.1. And its movement in an ordered year is two hundred and forty-eight degrees, fifty-five parts and fifteen seconds. Its symbol is 248.55.15."

            "11": "12 How is this? See that [if] the calculation required you to subtract two hundred degrees, fifty parts and forty seconds - its symbol being 200.50.40 - from one hundred degrees, twenty parts and thirty seconds - its symbol being 100.20.30: Add three hundred and sixty to the hundred - it will be four hundred and sixty degrees. [When] you begin to subtract the seconds from the seconds, for you to come to subtract forty from thirty is impossible. [So] bring over one part from the twenty parts and make it into sixty seconds. [Then] add it to the thirty, and it comes out to ninety seconds. Subtract the forty from them, and the remainder is fifty seconds. And go back to subtract fifty parts from nineteen parts - as you have already carried over one part and made it into seconds. But it is impossible to subtract fifty from nineteen. Hence bring over one of the degrees and make it into sixty parts. [Then] add it to the nineteen parts, and it comes out to seventy-nine parts. Subtract fifty from them. Twenty-nine parts remain. Go back and subtract two hundred degrees from four hundred and fifty-nine degrees - as you have already carried over one degree and made it into parts. And the remainder is two hundred and fifty-nine degrees. And it comes out that the symbol of the remainder is 259.29.50. And in this way [you can calculate] about each and every subtraction of the sun and the moon. ", 
            "10": "11 In all of the calculations altogether, when you want to subtract an amount from an amount: If that which you are subtracting is more than the one from which you are subtracting - even by one part - add three hundred and sixty degrees to that from which you are subtracting, so that it will be possible to subtract that amount from it.", 
            "13": "14 Hence if you measure the movement of each one of them by the [space] that surrounds the world for which the Earth is at its center - which is the [space] of the constellations - its movement would change. And it comes out that its movement on this day in the [space] of the constellations would be less or more than its movement yesterday or its movement tomorrow.", 
            "12": "13 And likewise the movement of the rest of the seven stars - each and every one in its orbit - is an even movement. There is no quickness or heaviness to it. Rather its motion today is like its motion yesterday which is like its motion tomorrow which is like its motion on each and every day. And even though the orbit of each one of them goes around the world, the Earth is not at its center.", 
            "15": "16 We have already said that these procedures that we are explaining in these laws are only for the sighting of the moon exclusively. Hence we have made the base [time] from which we are always starting for this calculation - from the beginning of the Fifth Night (Wednesday night), the date of which is the Third of the month of Nissan from this year, which is the seventeenth of the two hundred and sixtieth cycle. That is the year 4938 from the creation, which is the year 1489 for contracts, which is the year 1109 [from] the destruction of the second Temple. And that is what we are calling the base year in this calculation.", 
            "14": "15 The even movement that the star or the sun or the moon moves in its orbit is what is called the average movement. And the movement that would be [seen] in the [space] of the constellations - which is sometimes more and sometimes less - that is the true movement. And the true place of the sun or place of the moon is with it.", 
            "16": "17 And since the sighting will only be in the Land of Israel - as we have explained - we have made all the procedures of this calculation built on the city of Jerusalem and the other places that surround it, during the six or seven days in which we always see the moon and come and testify in court. And this place (Jerusalem and its surroundings) is off about thirty-three degrees - from thirty-five up to twenty-nine - to the north of the equator that encircles the world. And it is also off about twenty-four degrees - from twenty-seven up to twenty-one - to the west of the median line of civilization. ", 
            "1": "2 And there are great disagreements among the early sages of the nations who researched the calculation of the seasons and [mathematics]. And very wise people got confounded with them and missed things and questions arose for them. And there was one who was very exacting and [yet] did not encounter the correct way in the calculation of the sighting of the moon, but rather floated on great waters but [only] brought up clay in his hand.", 
            "0": "1 Since we said in these laws that the court would calculate with precision and know whether the moon was seen or it was not seen - we have known that anyone whose spirit is correct and whose heart desires matters of wisdom and to understand the secrets will want to know the ways with which they calculated to the point that one would know if the moon would be seen on this night or not be seen. ", 
            "3": "4 And these procedures should not be light in your eyes [just] because we do not need them at this time. For these procedures are unintuitive and profound procedures. And it is the secret of the intercalation (<i>sod heeebur</i>) that [only] the greats of the Sages would know; and they would only pass it on to ordained understanding ones. Whereas [with] the calculation at this time that we calculate with today - when there is no court to set [the month] according to sighting - even infants of their teacher's school arrive [at understanding it completely] in three or four days.", 
            "2": "3 And due to the length of the years and the multitude of experiments and research, the ways of this calculation became known to some sages. Moreover we have traditions and proofs from the Sages about their main principles written in books that are not known to all. And because of all these things, it is fitting in my eyes to explain the ways of this calculation - in order that it be prepared for the one whose heart fills him to approach this discipline to do it. ", 
            "5": "6 And likewise when he sees a small deficiency in one of the procedures towards the calculation that is fit for that procedure - [know that] we have done this intentionally since there is a counterbalancing advantage in the different procedure: That the thing come out to what is correct by approximate procedures without a long calculation. [This is] in order that one not accustomed to the procedures not get confounded by the multitude of calculations that do not [add anything] about the sighting of the moon.", 
            "4": "5 Lest a sage from the nations of the world or from the sages of Israel that studied the wisdom of Greece about these procedures with which I am calculating observe and see close approximations in some of these procedures and it enter his mind that something escaped us and that we did not know that there is an approximation in the procedure - let this not enter his mind. Rather every matter about which we were not exact is because we knew through the principles of [mathematics] with clear proofs that this thing does not harm the knowledge of the sighting [of the moon]. So we do not concern ourselves with it. Hence we were not exact abpout it.", 
            "7": "8 Hence if a calculation came out for you that the place of star x in [space] is seventy degrees, thirty parts and forty seconds - know that this star is in the constellation of Gemini in half of the eleventh degree of this constellation: Since the constellation of Aries is thirty degrees and the constellation of Taurus is thirty degrees, there remains eleven and a half degrees from the constellation of Gemini and forty seconds from the second half of a degree.", 
            "6": "7 The main principles that one must know first for all of the astronomical calculations - whether for the procedures for the calculation of the sighting or for other procedures - are these: [Space] is divided into three hundred and sixty degrees. Each and every constellation is thirty degrees. And one begins from the beginning of the constellation of Aries. And each and every degree is sixty parts (minutes). And each and every part is sixty seconds. And each and every second is sixty thirds. And thus can you be precise in the calculation and divide [further] anytime you want.", 
            "9": "10 [Regarding] all of the calculations, when you take the sum of one remainder with [another] remainder; or when you add one amount to [another] amount - take the sum of each type [of unit] with its type: The seconds with the seconds; the parts with the parts; and the degrees with the degrees. And anytime there is a sum of sixty degrees, make one part and add it to the parts. And whenever there is a sum of sixty parts, make it a degree and add it to the degrees. And when you take the sum of the degrees, remove three hundred and sixty. And the remainder [of that] - from three hundred and sixty and down - is what we take for the calculation. ", 
            "8": "9 And likewise if it came out that its place in [space] is three hundred and twenty degrees - know that this star is in the constellation of Aquarius in its twentieth degree. And in this way is it for all of the amounts. The order of the constellations is like this: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius [and] Pisces. "

And if that place was from Syria, like Tyre and Damascus, and Ashkelon and such like, or from the outside of the land [of Israel], like Egypt and Amon and Moav and such like, they do like the custom of their fathers in their hands, if one day, one day, and if two days, two days.

Our own computation is only for the purpose of making it known to the public; since we are aware that in Eretz Yisrael they use the same method of computation, we calculate in order to find out what day it is that has been determined by the residents of Eretz Yisrael.— —",

That at a time that there is a Sanhedrin, we fix by the sighting, and when the Sanhedrin doesn't exist, we fix by this calculation that we calculate today and we don't relate to the sighting. Rather, sometimes the day we fix with this calculation will be the day of sighting, or a day before, or a day after. And that it will be after the sighting by a day is a wonder (i.e. very rare), and [this is so] in lands that are to the west of the land of Israel. ",

Moses and Aaron were told: \"This month shall be to you the beginning of months\" (Exodus 12:2), and the sages have derived from an oral tradition going back to our teacher Moses that the meaning of this verse is: This evidence shall rest with you and your successors. When, however, no Sanhedrin exists in Eretz Yisrael, the new-moon days and the leap years are determined only by such methods of calculation as we are employing today.",

During the last generation of the talmudic sages, when Eretz Yisrael was in ruins and no established court had survived there. In the times of [the Tannaim] the sages of the Mishnah, and also in the period of the talmudic sages prior to Abbayyé and Rava, the people relied on the courts of Eretz Yisrael for setting the calendar.",

But the residents of Eretz Yisrael at our time should continue to keep only one day, according to their [ancient] custom, for they never observed two days. Hence, it becomes evident that the second day of the festival that we observe in the Diaspora nowadays is something enacted by the sages.", 
            "4": "At the present time, when no Sanhedrin and court of Eretz Yisrael are in existence, we set the calendar by calculation. It might be logical that the Jewish people everywhere, even those living in remote places of the Diaspora, should observe one day only [as holyday] just as the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael do, in view of the same calculation followed by all in determining the calendar. The sages, however, have made it a rule that the people must carefully follow the custom of their forefathers.", 
            "7": "Moreover, even in Jerusalem itself, which was the seat of the court, it frequently happened that <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> was observed for two days. If witnesses failed to arrive on the thirtieth day of <i>Elul</i>, the people were accustomed to celebrate it as <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, while waiting for witnesses to appear, observing the following day likewise as a holyday. Since they used to keep two days <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> even when the method of observation was in use, the sages ordained that even the citizens of Eretz Yisrael should keep it for two days always, at the present time when the calendar is determined by computation. You may thus infer that even the second day of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> is based on the authority of the sages.", 
            "6": "When the fixing of the month was accomplished by the observation method, the majority of the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael observed <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> for two days, because they were in doubt as to which day had been declared as new-moon day, since the messengers could not go forth on a holyday [and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> coincides with the first day of the month].", 
            "9": "If this matter of observing one day were to depend upon the proximity to Jerusalem, all the Jews of Egypt would observe only one day, since the messengers of <i>Tishri</i> could have reached them in time. The distance between Jerusalem and Egypt, by way of Ashkelon, is indeed only a matter of eight days' journey or less. The same applies to most places in Syria. Hence you may infer that the thing does not depend upon the proximity of a place.",

For example, a locality at a distance of five days' journey or less from Jerusalem could certainly have been reached by the messengers in time; yet it cannot be said that the residents of this place should observe only one day.— — Possibly no messengers were ever sent out to this place because there were no Jews there, and when the calendar began to be determined by computation the place was settled by Jews who were required to observe two days by their previous custom. Or else, no messengers ever came to this place because of insecurity in travel, as was the case between Judea and Galilee during the period of [the Tannaim] the sages of the Mishnah, or, because non-Jews, living along the road, would prevent the messengers from passing through the area."
