                    "2": "And I, the author, say that there is no distinction between the forgotten sheaf, the corner and the poor tithe on the one hand, and other charity on the other. As behold there is a story (Jerusalem Talmud Peah 8:7) about a student of Rebbi who had 199 dinar, and Rebbi wanted to bequeath him a large gift. However one of the rabbis completed it to be two hundred (which would disqualify him from receiving charity). Rebbi heard [about this] - he said, \"This one was struck by the plague of the pious.\" He [then] said to [another] one of the rabbis, \"Go and remove it from him,\" and he removed it. So Rebbi gave him that present. Behold, you learn from this that someone who has two hundred zuz may not take from the charity fund. But everything is according to his needs and the needs of his household, as Rabbenu Ephraim, may his memory be blessed, explained. And that is how I explain that which my teachers ask about that [passage in the chapter entitled] Haba al Yevimto (Yevamot 63a): The Rabbis taught, \"One who lends a sela to a poor person at his time of need, about him the verse states (Isaiah 58:9), 'Then shall you call, and the Lord will answer.'\" Yet in the first chapter of Chagigah (5a), we say, then \"many evils and troubles are come upon them\" (Deuteronomy 31:21)  - \"Shmuel said, 'This is [referring to] one who provides money to a poor person at his time of need.'\" And it appears in my eyes - me, the author - that that [passage] in Chagigah is when he had 199 dinar and they wanted to give him a thousand dinar, but [this one] heard and completed the two hundred in order to make him lose the thousand that they wanted to give him. There, certainly, \"many evils and troubles are come upon them\" - since he caused this poor man to lose a thousand dinar. But someone who gives a loan to a poor person at his time of need - certainly that one, he shall 'call, and the Lord will answer him.' As he intended [it] for his good. And even if he had 199 dinar and this one lent him a dinar and completed the two hundred with this dinar - nevertheless, it is still called, 'he shall call, and the Lord will answer.' Since this dinar is not his and he has to repay it, he still does not have two hundred of his own; so it is permissible for him to take from the charity fund. And you should know that in the first chapter of Chagigah, it [specifically] mentioned, \"one who provides money to a poor person at the time of his need,\" such that he provides him with that money that it should be his, so that he [then] have two hundred zuz and it would be forbidden for him to take from the charity fund. But here, it is \"one who lends a sela to a poor person\" - as he intends to benefit him with a loan. So he merits, 'he shall call, and the Lord will answer him.' "
