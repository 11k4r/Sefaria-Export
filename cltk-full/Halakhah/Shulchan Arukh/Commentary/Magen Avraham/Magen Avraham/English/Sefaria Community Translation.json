However according to the one explanation of the three steps brought in the Beis Yosef you really need 6 steps (and we include the steps you take forward). Therefore according to this opinion one must take three steps forwards. For this reason were careful not to have people pass infront of others when there standing in there place (after taking three steps back) to not interrupt between the six steps (Lechem Chamudos). See siman 95 sif 1 (where the Rama brings an opinion that need to take three steps forward before Shemoneh eshrei aswell. If so you already have 6 steps, 3 before shemona esrie and 3 after). And also see siman 124 (sif 1 brings from the kesavim to take 3 steps forward at kedusha and wait there until tachanun) and siman 131 sif 2 (where he says if one doesn't have a seat where he took 3 steps to then should take the steps back to get to his seat to sit)."

Yose (Shabbat 86b) that the Torah was given on the 7th of Sivan? After all, we do conclude that separation from sexual intercourse [of man and wife, in regard to certain laws of Tumah] requires six half-days, as is written in Yore Deah 196. [R. Yose's opinion -- that the Torah was given on the 7th of Sivan -- is based on a need for husband and wife to separate a full three days. Since the Halakha today requires a 3 days for this particular separation, presumably R. Yose is correct about the date of Revelation.] (And I believe I've seen this question before in some Poseik's writings.)  But in our calendar, Shavuot is always on the 6th of Sivan!     In truth, the Rambam rules in the Laws of Avot haTumah Ch. 5, that we require only three half-days [of separation]. The Kesef Mishna comments there that in the Talmudic text of the Rambam and the Rashba, the Sages only require three half-days, and that the Rambam rules according to them. See there. If so, our custom is in line with the Rambam. What is written in Yoreh Deah, supporting R. Yose, is but stringency [chumra; it is the advised practice, but not the actual letter of the law].       A further difficulty: the Torah was given on the 51st day of their counting! For they left Egypt on the fifth of the week (Wednesday night / Thursday) and the Torah was given on a Shabbat. In this regard, the [book] HaAsarah Maamarot already answered, that it is meant to hint at the Second Day of Yom Tov of the Exiles. In fact, it’s possible that that’s the reason why Moshe added a day of his own accord, but this isn’t the place to discuss it.        ........ It says in the Zohar that the original pious ones would be awake all the night working in Torah.  And already most of those who learn do this.  It's possible to give a reason for this according to its simple understanding, that Israel slept all the night, and the Holy One Blessed be He had to wake them, as the midrash says.  Therefore, we need to fix this. ",
