Some are lenient in this, and such is the accepted practice. Nevertheless it would be  preferable to be stringent where there is no real need. But this refers only (to returning) directly onto a Kirah, however placing it next to it (the stove) or even next to a fire where the heat is Yad soledes bo is permitted even close to dusk. For a Tanur there is no difference between returning a pot onto it or next to it when that area is at a temperature of Yad soledes bo, but if that area is not Yad soledes it is permitted even on Shabbos, as will be stated below in Siman 318.</i>", 
            "0": "1. The Laws of Kirah and a Tanur, placing pots on them on Erev Shabbos:  A Kirah is one which is constructed in the shape of a (large) kettle. Pots are placed on top of it, where it has its mouth, and there is room for placing two pots. If this Kirah was fired by means of Gefes [olive waste], or with wood, one may not place food on it to cook in the evening (on Erev Shabbos) with the intention of leaving it there (until after Shabbos arrives) – unless the food has already been fully cooked and is shrinking (i.e., continually getting bigger and smaller as a result from the cooking) to its detriment, in which case it need not be feared that the coals in the stove will be stirred. It is also permitted to place the pot on the stove if the food is raw, i.e. it has not been cooked at all. Since it is raw, one will not pay attention to it until the next morning, as it is can finish cook during the night without stoking the coals. However, if the food is cooked a little bit, or even if it is fully cooked but shrinking through cooking will benefit it, we are concerned that the coals might be stoked. Therefore, leaving it on the stove is forbidden unless the stove is raked, in other words, all the coals are removed from it or are covered with ashes, in other words the coals are covered with ashes to lessen the heat’s intensity. If a raw piece (of meat) is put into the pot, it is permitted just as if it would consist entirely of raw (meat), since now he will not pay attention to the entire pot. But even if the coals were not raked (meaning the coals were taken out of the oven) or covered with ashes (meaning the coals were covered with ashes) it is permitted to place a pot next to it, on the outside. If it was fired with straw or stubble, it is permitted to allow a pot to stay on it even if it was not Gerufa (raked from the stove) or Ketuma (the coals are covered with ashes). <i> RAMA: If two Kirah stoves are joined one beside the other, with an earthenware partition between them: if one is Gerufa or Ketuma and the second is not Gerufa or Ketuma, it is permitted to allow a pot to stay on the one which is Gerufa or Ketuma, even though the one which is not Gerufa or Ketuma will add to its heat. </i> However, as for a Tanur stove even if it was fueled by straw or stubble, it is forbidden to place (a pot) even adjacent to it – even if it is Garuf ve’katum <i> RAMA as long as it is Yad soledes bo. (Haga'ot Mordechai) </i> It goes without saying that it is forbidden to let a pot stay within it or on it. As for a Kupach-stove which has room for placing one pot on it, where it was fueled by straw or stubble, it has the status of a Kirah; where it was fueled by Gefes or wood, it has the status of a Tanur. <i>(Our types of ovens have the status of a Kirah) (R\"an).</i> And if he forgot and left it (on the stove) if it is a Tavshil that is cooked all the way it is permitted even if it is food that improves as it condenses (called 'Mitztamech v'Yafeh Lo'). But if it is a dish that is beginning to cook and is not cooked all the way it is forbidden until Motzei Shabbos. Where one deliberately leaves a pot of food, it is forbidden in both cases<i> RAMA: until a time period has elapsed (after Shabbos) during which the cooking done on Shabbos could be done (after Shabbos) (Ha'agahot Ashiri and Rambam). But if a Non-Jew puts it back on on Shabbos the law is the same as one who forgot and left it on (Ha'agahot Ashiri). And if a Jew puts it back on the law is the same as one who intentionally left it on. (Ha'agahot Mordechai). And if the food condensed through more cooking to its detriment it is permitted because he receives no benefit from the forbidden thing. (Beis Yosef, and see the beginning of Siman 237) </i> There are those who say that where it has already been cooked to the degree of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i (i.e. the name of a thief who ate his food semi-cooked) </i> or it is completely cooked and further cooking will improve it, it is permitted to leave it on a Kirah. <i> RAMA: or even on a Tanur (HaMagid; Ha'agahot Mordechai; the beginning of the paragraph Kirah in the Beis Yosef) </i> even one fired with Gefes (olive waste) or wood, and even if it was not Gerufa or Ketuma. In this opinion, Garuf ve’katum and firing with straw and stubble were mentioned only when the cooking process has begun but has not reached the stage of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i; </i>or, where one has removed the pot from the stove and desires to return it on Shabbos. Where one forgets and leaves a pot of food, which has begun to cook, but has not reached the stage of <i>Ma’achal ben Derusa’i </i>, it is forbidden to eat it.

On Shabbos, it is permissible to place onto a pot of hot water, a dish of food that is already fully cooked such as Panades or the like, in order to warm it, since he is not cooking in a usual manner. However it is definitely forbidden to place (food) under cloths that cover a water kettle. <i> RAMA: similarly it is forbidden to place (food) on a Kirah even if it is Gerufa and Ketuma, as the sages only permitted Chazora (but not placing a pot for the first time), as has been explained above. Some (authorities) permit placing (a pot of food) into a Tanur used for baking on Erev Shabbos, when no food was left warming in it (it was merely used for baking on Erev Shabbos), only a small amount of heat remains and there need be no concern that this will cause it (the pot) to be cooked – provided (the food) has not cooled completely. Some, however, are stringent here, and (hold that) if the heat of the Tanur is so intense that it is of Yad soledes bo, it is forbidden. See below Siman 318. One may not tell a non-Jew to do anything that is forbidden to do himself. It is therefore forbidden to tell a non-Jew to heat up the pot (of food) that has cooled. If one does so, it is forbidden to eat it even cold. [Beis Yosef and the Teshuvos HaRashba] However, if the food has not cooled below the temperature at which it is edible, it may be eaten if the non-Jew heats it up. For this reason it is common practice to have non-Jews remove pots of food from ovens in which they have been stored to retain their heat, and place them next to or on top of a heating stove, and then have the (non-Jewish) maidservant light the stove, whereupon the food will become boiling hot once again. However it is forbidden to do this through a Jew. (Terumas HaDeshen) If, however, the pots are still hot they may be placed next to the heating stove. The reason is that, as has been explained, our ovens have a status of a Kirah, and placing it next to a Kirah, which is not Garuf Ve’katum, has the same law as placing directly on top of it when it is Garuf Ve’katum (which is permitted). It has already been stated that the customary practice is to be lenient (and permit) to do Chazora [returning a pot to the stove] even if the pot has been placed on the ground. Similarly, placing (a pot) next to an oven, which is not Garuf Ve’katum (is permitted) if the food is still hot and fully cooked. It is a widespread, accepted practice to permit this.

And likewise with anything that is pleasant for him in this world, his intent should not be for his pleasure, but rather for the service of the Creator, may He be blessed; as it is written (Proverbs 3:6), \"In all of your ways, know Him.\" And the Sages said, \"Let all of your actions be for the sake of Heaven.\" As even optional things – such as eating, drinking, walking, sitting, getting up, sexual relations and conversation – all of them should be for the service of your Creator or for something that enables serving Him.

Others understand \"with wisdom\", that G-d arranged the food of Adam Harishon [before he was created] and afterwards he was created. \"And create in him holes, holes hollow places, hollow places\", meaning: many holes, for example mouth nose and anus, and also creates in him limbs with many hollow places, like the heart, belly and intestines. \"If one of them to shut up\", meaning: that in the places there are holes there is one hole, Which is the mouth, that when [one is inside his mother] he is closed off [dependent on mother for all needs does not need to use organs] and [if] when he goes into the air of the world it [his organs]  remain clogged, it would not be possible to remain alive even for one moment.
