And the reason for the daily prayers is because it makes sense that everybody should ask for mercy for themselves. However, this refers to a person who knows how to make the blessing. But if they do not know how to make the blessing, their friend can make it for them. As it says in the chapter, \"Three who ate together\"(45a), \"If one is a scholar and one is an ignoramous, the scholar makes the blessing and the ignoramous get's credit.\" And this is written in the Mordechai and in the Haghot Asheri at the end of the first chapter of Tractate Rosh HaShana.

This is in Perek HaSholeah (Gittin 40a) where we say one who abandons his slave [the slave] goes free and we say that if his master lays phylacteries on him he goes free and there it is also taught that the same is true if his master was a prayer leader and called him to go up to the Torah [ for an aliyah] that he [the slave] also goes free nevertheless there is reason to wonder why our master [the Tur] wrote that he is like an Israelite in every regard that teacher that he [the freed slave] is permitted to marry an Israelite woman for regarding one who abandons his slave in the Gemara over there we says that the [freed slave] requires a bill of manumission and regarding his master laying phylacteries on him or his master instructing him to read [his aliyah] from the Torah Maimonides writes that he he requires a bill of manumission and our master wrote his [Maimonides'] words in the Tur Yoreh Deah Cap. 267 and since a bill of manumission is a sine qua non how is he allowed to [marry] an Israelite daughter? We may answer that he [the Tur] is of the opinion that whenever [the Talmud] says he [the slave] goes free and needs a bill of manumission he is allowed to marry an Israelite daughter on account of the reason that the Rosh wrote there regarding one who marrys off his slave and I will write his words below and I will write that on this matter the Ramah disagrees."

Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him Rabbi Zeira: You possess such an extreme halakha, but I teach this halakha: With regard to one who writes a document of betrothal for his maidservant, stating: You are hereby betrothed to me, Rabbi Meir says: She is betrothed, and the Rabbis argue and say: She is not betrothed, here the context of Rabbi Zeira’s statement is not that of a slave who married a woman in his master’s presence but a case where the slave’s master himself provided a wife for him [as this is certainly proof that he had emancipated him. The Gemara questions this answer:] Is there anything like this, where for his slave he would not violate a prohibition[, and by providing a wife for his slave he indicates that he must have emancipated the slave,] but he himself might violate the prohibition[, as he is suspected of marrying his maidservant without having freed her]? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: With what are we dealing here? This is a case where he said to the maidservant when he gave her the document of betrothal: Become emancipated with this and become betrothed to me with this. Rabbi Meir holds that this formulation written in the document of betrothal: You are hereby betrothed to me, contains a formulation of emancipation and therefore serves both as a bill of manumission and a document of betrothal. And the Rabbis hold: This formulation is not a formulation of emancipation. The Rif, the Rambam and the Rosh conclude with that which R. Zeira said: not only this but we forces his master to write for him a bill of manumission and the Rosh explains that the reason we require him [to write] a bill of manumission is to prevent the master from claiming \"I did not emancipate him him and he is my slave\" and certainly we we follow the intelligent estimate that certainly he emancipated him and we release him [the slave] from him [the master] and he is permitted to marry a free woman since he [the Talmud] did not say that he is prohibited to his wife until he [the master] frees him and the Ramah did not explain it this way until here is hi  [ the Rosh's] language. The words of the one who disagrees with this our master wrote in the Tur Yoreh Deah Cap. 267 but here he presented his words anonymously according to the opinion of the Rosh. There is reason to question what he wrote that in a case where he [the slave] married in the presence of his master the rule is the same as when his master marries him off to a woman for behold in the Gemara it suggests that only when his master marries him off to a woman because had he not emancipated him he would not have done a prohibition with his slave to marry him off to woman but when the slave marries in his master's presence he does not go free and this is what the Rif and the Rosh write explicitly and so to did our master the Tur in Yoreh Deah Cap. 267 Maybe it is possible to suggest that [the slave who marries in the presence of his master] does not go free nevertheless, regarding the prohibition of a married woman, we are concerned for had he not emancipated him he would not have allowed him to do a prohibition in his presence and therefore we says his betrothal works on her because of uncertainty and according to this it is prohibited for him to remain with her until [his master] emancipates him nevertheless his words are very unclear and require study."
