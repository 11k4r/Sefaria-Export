Therefore, when Moshe Rabeinu asked G-d \"when the Israelites ask me what is His name, what should I answer them?\", G-d answered him: \"so shall you say to the descendants of Israel: 'Ehe-ye' sent me to you'\". And since G-d knew that the Israelites would not understand the true nature of this name (Ehe-ye), He added an explanation and said: \"thus should you say to the Israelites: \"The L-ord, the G-d of your forefathers, the G-d of Abraham, the G-d of Isaac, and the G-d of Jacob sent me to you, this is My name forever and this is My remembrance for every generation (Ex. 3:15)\"."
