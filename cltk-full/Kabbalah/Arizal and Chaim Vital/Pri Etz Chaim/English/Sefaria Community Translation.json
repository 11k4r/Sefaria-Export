Afterwards take the bitter herbs (<i>marror</i>), the <i>karpas</i>, the shankbone and the egg and place them upon the three matzot - the shankbone which hints to kindness (<i>chesed</i>) on your right, the egg on your left; and the bitter herbs, which hint to harmony, 'extend from end to end' in the middle, between the shankbone and the egg. In other books - because harmony (<i>tiferet</i>) is what mediates between kindness and might (<i>gevurah</i>). And the <i>charoset</i> is on the right, below the shankbone in the right column, corresponding to victory (<i>netzach</i>). And place the <i>karpas</i>, which hints to splendor (<i>hod</i>), below the egg on the left in the left column. And place the horseradish below the bitter herbs in the middle column, to make the sandwich later on, and that corresponds to foundation (<i>yesod</i>). And the plate itself, which includes them all, corresponds to majesty (<i>malkhut</i>)."
