They learn this wisdom to enter its secrets to know their Creator, to achieve the wonderful level of true knowledge of the torah, and to pray before their Creator to unite, via their mitzvot, G-d and his Shechina, and that is the most desirable service before the Creator of all.",

                    "5": "The sinning group includes those who draw near to this wisdom because they see themselves as great sages who lack nothing but this wisdom… Can it be that such a smart person would have a less wise person speak before him regarding this wisdom, and not respond with his own share? This group also includes those of coarse arrogance, who also study for non-altruistic purposes… May G-d save us from them and from their portion."
