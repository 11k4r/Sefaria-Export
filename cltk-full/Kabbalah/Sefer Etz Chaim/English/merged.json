This is the secret of let there be atmosphere in the midst of the water and let it separate water from water as mentioned in Zohar Bereshit 4:32 there is a kruma and in the middle is maavei of a man that there is a space between upper and lower and draws down from upper and gives to lower then is left all the light to the upper from this curtain and there its pressed together and attached and then splits from this curtain and goes down and lightens the rest of the body from the stomach downward this is the aspect of curtain mentioned from in the beginning of the Idra bederush these are the kings this is what is written in the Zohar that there is one curtain between the emanator to Keter however it is true that how many gulgaltanis there that does not have this thought as mentioned in the beginning of the Idra and the Keter of ZA is a curtain to mother ends at it and so forth But the Keter of all of Atzilut is stopped by this curtain of Adam Kadmon However definitely by way gazing of the light upwards from the stomach was enough to give power to the world of Atzilut to receive their light but it wasnt enough to give power to the world of Beriyah also to add another aspect to put there this covering and the curtain mentioned we find that that they are 2 things restriction of light to above that allows emanation to receive its light the concept of the curtain was to allow also Beria to receive its light and understand and know how their is a curtain between Emanation and Creation and we see by way of elevating this  light that is in the lower half above from the stomach as explained then a strong light is strengthened in the half of the upper body then this light is made in the aspect of Mayin Nukvin to the cantillations of Sag they are ear nose mouth to their original sources within the body and not to the light that goes out by way of the openings then by way of this Mayin Nukvin that goes up there the name Ayin Bet is joined that is in the skull of Adam Kadmon with the aspect of sag thats there they are the roots of ear nose mouth that are the cantillations as mentioned and then a new light is drawn from above from this joining and splits and descends by way of the curtain from the stomach downward however the first light that was originally and elevated upwards returns and doesnt descend and is left there from the stomach upwards and there it puts its source always and from there spreads and goes out by way of the eyes these are the points is pulled and spread outwards until the end of the feet of Adam Kadmon as mentioned we see all the light drawn until the stomach even of the aspect of eyes are all consumed and included in the bounded therefore they are not recognized but the light that is drawn from beneath the stomach until the feet this alone is called points since now alone and also this light that goes down by way of the curtain anew through this zivug mentioned this also splits the body and vessel of Adam Kadmon and goes out and lightens these points. We have two kinds of light for the purpose of the points and also we have a 3rd light and it is behechrach for when the light of the eye descends and spreads downwards through the bounded ones we see it observes the lights of Achor Panim and it waters from there and and takes from there light for the sake of creating vessels of points and takes from 3 aspects that are the light of Achor Panim the concept is in this way for behold we explained that the light of the ears spreads out to the curls of the beard and lights and nose and mouth passing also by way if so its fitting that since that the light of the eyes of Adam Kadmon are drawn this way they are mixed with them and takes their light and we see 10 points are they and the first three they take light from that which was drawn from observing of the eye in Achor panim from their place until the place of connecting the curls of the beard as is known and they dont receive only by the curls of the beard for from there begins and not from from that within the curls of the beard and above but the 7 lower  points doesnt receive only from that which is drawn from observing of the nose and the mouth and the curls of the beard and lower as is known because the nose reaches until the chest and the mouth until the stomach and not from the curls of the beard and upward we see for according to the three points we take a light for the purpose of their vessels from the three lights that are Achor Panim in the curls specifically but the 7 lower didnt take only from the aspect of lights alone that are nose and mouth from the curls and downwards until the stomach because the light of the upper ear already finished and closed in the curls of the beard therefore the lighting of the three upper points are greater than the lower 7 And for this reason the first three kings didnt die since they had a greater light and their vessel was very high since it was made from the aspect of the upper ear. And the nose and the mouth for when the eye observes in the lights of the ear nose and mouth their vessels are made as we learned because we took their vessels from the place where the light of the ears already existed. They are of the aspect of Neshama drawn there that they are already curls of the beard as learned. However the 7 lower kings ended since there vessels were made from gazing of the eye nose and the mouth alone. And was missing from them the light of the upper ear and we see also in the tree upper themselves there is a difference between them and that is from from Keter even the Achorayim didnt descend only the achorayim of NHY alone but the achorayim of abba and Imma of points alone the face remained in its place.The reason is because these lights that are drawn from the curls of the beard separated to 3. The Keter took from the aspect of ear itself from that which the seeing drew from gazing at the light of the ear even moreso joined there 2 other lights and from this a vessel was made for Keter of points and Abba took from what the seeing drew from the lights of the nose and also the light of the mouth joined there we see the Keter that took from the ear a great light its vessel wasnt broken but Abba and Imma that takes only from the nose and mouth was broken the achorayim of their vessels we see Abba and Imma if they accepted this light of the nose and mouth of Adam Kadmon when it was above close to the place of the openings of the ears even though it didnt take from the light of the ears itself only a little light the achorayim of their vessels were upkept but since that it didnt take only from the end of the ear which is a place of the curls of the beard therefore even though that it took a little it didnt help therefore the achorayim of their vessels broke but the Keter since it took from the light of the ear itself even taking from the end since it took its very essence it was enough and even the achorayim of its vessels didnt break moreso in Abba and Imma that was taking only a little light and also that it is in a far place and here we explain these 3 aspects for Keter sustains them all Abba and Imma broke and their achorayim fell and Zuns front and back fell we see hinted to in the pasuk and the earth was Tohu and Bohu that was spoken of in the ending of the Kings of the points as we learned hinted to twice the word tohu one explained in the pasuk and second in the first letters retroactively and the land was tohu and it is according to 2 aspects spoken of before Tohu straight refered to in the pasuk is the aspect of 8 kings that ended and nullified even their front straight and tohu in the first letters retroactively are the aspect of nullifying the achorayim of Abba and Imma for they are all retractively are the aspect of achorayim and we see definitely also in the points you have surrounding and inner lights. And the idea is we explained that from 3 lights achor panim drawn from them gazing of the eyes for the sake of the points and this is the aspect of the third light mentioned that we explained that is for the sake of vessels to the points and we need to know that the light separates to two and that which was taken from the right side these are actual lights that which was taken from the left side they are the vessels and also we explained that the light has an inner aspect and an outer aspect and the vessel has an inner and outer we find that all these 4 aspects takes of the gazing of the eyes from the three lights of Achor Panim and this is the way for behold when the eye gazes at the light of the ears in yosher according to gazing of the eyes itself that is the curls of the beard itself from the right side it is the aspect of surrounding light and that which is also from the right side only it is far and it is from the side of this inner light that is small and then in this way in the left side that which is according to gazing of the eye itself it is the outer vessel and that which is on the sides is the inner vessel and that which is taken from the lights of the nose is different way for that which is taken from the light of the nose before it reaches the mouth and its from the right side it is the surrounding light and from the mouth and downwards it is inner light and this way in the left side they are vessels the aspect of outer and inner and also it is what was taken from the mouth divides to two for that which was taken from the mouth until it reaches to the curls of the beard from the right side it is surrounding light and from The beard downwards it is inner and in this way it is the left side to make vessels for inner and outer."

All the aspects of eyes are points as we have learned we see that when we count from Ayin Bet all aspects of Ayin Bet are yud from YHVH and sag is the first letter  heh of YHVH and from mah the letter vav and from Ben the last letter heh and when we count the name from the aspect of sag alone the cantillations become of sag the letter yud and the points of the first heh and the letter crowns of the letter vav and the last letter heh and when we divide also the cantillations it becomes also the letter yud of the ear and the first letter heh of the nose and the letter and the letter vav of the mouth and the last letter heh of the  eyes. We see that the eye has in it the aspect of the last letter heh and the first letter heh and this is the secret of what is written in the tikkunim ani yeshena velibi er  according to the last letter heh in the bitul  of the light,of points ani yeshena the secret of sleep I am also yeshena the letters second letters it is chochma which is the first letter heh it is second to keter it is known that the cantillations are keter and the points are chochma and the crowns are bina and the letters are the seven lower Sefirot we find that the eye is of the aspect of chochma that are the points this is the reason that the wise men of the edah are called the wise men of the congregation as is written and it will be if from the eyes of the congregation and in these letters are the aspects of the kings that ruled in the land of Edom and ended as was written before and this is the secret of and the land was tohu and bohu because the land is the last heh that is the aspect of eyes as we learned before and this is the idea of the end of the kings until the coming of their tikkunim as it is said let there be light and there was light and this is open your eyes and see and to understand this pasuk better we explain the foundation of the idea and it is said for behold the points they are nine comprised of kamatz patach tziri segol shevah cholem shorek chirek kibbutz however also there is within them aspects of higher things that are points cholem and emtza like shorek and all the others that are below there place is under the letters and afterwards we will explain all this and we see all the seven after of points are in the form yudin All except the first two points that are kamatz and patach they are two vavin and yud and the idea is when you count all the yudin that are contained within the seven points these are 13 yudin numerically 130 like numerically ayin yud nun to show that from the eyes come out points and leaves kamatz patach that is yud and two vavin and is numerically 22 and it is the secret of the 22 letters and that from them are made vessels of points and if you will say why nirshamu and hinted to are these vessels in the two first points of all of them and the maalot however the idea is that from these two first points that are keter and chochma of the points as is known from them are made vessels elected hashar and these,that come out from them vessels to the sefirot beneath them another reason it is known that the second lower points are the seven kings that ended but the first three kings didn't and it is known the aspect of ending is breaking of the vessels therefore the seven latter points were left without vessels and only light that is the aspects of points but the firsts that didn't end  and were left with their vessels we see the lights are hidden and enclothed within the vessels and are called after the vessels that are 22 letters hinting to kamatz and patach and we see the kamatz oversees the keter as is known and the keter is the cantillations and the patach oversees chochma and these are the points therefore they are called the two points these kamatz and patach these oversee the ideas we mentioned above. And it is that all the time yet to come out are only the cantillations of sag that are the aspects of the lights of achor panim and yet the  lights are closed and kamutzim. And when it comes to the aspects of the points that are chochma that is patach and it is the. aspect of ayin as we learned then is opened in the opening of the eyes as is mentioned in tikkunim and this relates points of patach but firstly in the aspects of cantillations that are Keter its kamatz because the lights are kamutzim and closed. We return to the subject of the pasuk open your eyes and see because when we come to the aspect of ayin that are the points then we say open your eyes for then we have the opening of the lights. And we see already explained all these aspects they are in the name of sag and this name hints to bina that is upper gevurah that on them relies the justices therefore in this aspect of sag  is the idea  of bitul of the kings also in particular sag itself contains within it the aspects of cantillations that they are also called av while being in sag But the points of sag are the very essence of sag itself they are sag of sag there they are bitul and that which is written they are all sag together for in the name of sag is all the bitul and sag itself oversees on that which is written that it is in language of turned back which is the nullifications of the kings and also the eye is that which is called also for sag like the achor panim as written above and that is the idea for is it not the 3 aspects that is the achor panim that are the cantillations it is the name sag of them the aspect of yhvh that is sag yud hy vav hy: ", 
                "2": "3. Heichal Beit Derushei points: We  will now discuss the world of points these are of the aspect of lights that come through the eyes of Adam Kadmon. We have already explained that there are 4 aspects within them and these are the 4 YHVH Av Sag Ben Mah. and in each level there is cantillations points crowns letters The brain of Adam Kadmon is Ayin Bet. From the ears downward all the way to the feet is Sag. However this idea existed before the end of the kings in the Bounded world and afterwards it was the aspect of Mah and Ben from the place of the belly till lower below the feet as was written. We have already explained that in the name Sag there is cantillations points crowns letters the cantillations  are split into 3 parts which are named Back of the Front However the points are of the aspect of lights that are drawn from his eyes. The idea is that the breath that comes from the opening of the ears is a small air for if a man puts his finger in his ear and holds it there he will here a voice of moving. This is because of the movement of the air that is within and is trying to go out and is unable to. However as soon as he pulls out his finger the sound quiets and we see that from his ears this air comes out as ten sefirot of the aspect of ears as explained above. Afterwards the nose has air that is stronger and comes out from here the ten sefirot of the nose. and afterwards in the mouth there is air more powerful from all of the others because  all the light that goes down is more apparent and powerful and is revealed there and  out from it comes the ten sefirot of Bounded. These are three places of the aspects of cantillations of SAG. Afterwards from the eyes comes out the points of Sag therefore the air from the eyes is not as powerful as the three other openings. Because the light of the small points of points are not as powerful as the cantillations. But with all this we see a small amount of strength in seeing with the eyes as is seen with the senses of the eyes naturally as the idea of bat hayana that is born by the efroach from looking at it for a time unlike other birds that sit on there eggs and hatch it. This proves the apparent power of seeing with the eyes. and behold from this looking of the eyes produces points. From this we understand what is written in Tikkunim #70 That the number 126 that makes up YHVH  from the 4 letters in the form of eyes with their points  In the secret of their back was filled with eyes. The image is shown at the end of this sefer.All the aspects of points eyes to dots When you count from Ayin Bet we see all the  aspects of Bet:",

MB already we learned above in the anaf of 4 gates of derushei circles and straightness for these lights explained above that comes out from achor panim of Adam kadmon don't include the aspect of igul and straightness but they are all straightness only but the aspect of the forehead and the eye of this man that is the secret of these points has within them the aspect of circles and straightness example of Adam kadmon and come out from nhy and half of tiferet of this Adam kadmon and below from the aspect of straightness and there come out first circles of points and these surround and cover nhy and half of tiferet of Adam kadmon that is the secret of straightness and surrounds it this straightness and is between it and we see already that there is an inner light and an outer light in this Adam Kadmon and all are in the secret of straightness and we see these circles of points cause a stop between the surrounding light of this straightness and between the. Inner light of the vessels of this man from all sides and afterwards the surrounding of these lights the surrounding of this straightness of this man surrounds and covers all the circles of points and within these circles there you have the straightness of nekudim within. Them is the example of the straightness of Adam Kadmon within them however there is one difference and it is that these circles that cover netzach hod yesod and half of tiferet of Adam kadmon don't cover them from two sides because the source of the light was on the side of image of this Adam Kadmon of straightness of itself but from this lighting spreads out beyond it also between the aspect of straightness and the aspect of circles of points we find that nhy and half tiferet of this Adam Kadmon enclothes and covers from these points between from the aspect of circles of it and between the aspect of straightness of them and Adam Kadmon is between them however this that we mentioned that there is in points the aspect of circles and the aspect of straightness it was not like this from the beginning until the beginning of atzilut the points emanated in the aspect of circles of them alone without straightness and these are the aspects of nefesh of nekudim as was written therefore there breaking came about because only the aspect of nefesh came out they are circles and are not able to receive upper light therefore came about all the aspects of end of the kings and there bitul as explained in entirety in the pereks this is the secret of the pasuk that Elohim made man straight and they requested many understandings because Adam kadmon was there in the aspect of straightness and this is he made man straight and these that are the nekudim sought many explanations that are the circles and weren't made with them the aspect of straightness therefore broke and ended and afterwards it is explained how they sought many explanations that are the aspects of  and why the points went out as circles moreso than the lights of back to front for all of them only went out in the way of straightness and the tikkun of kings that died was by bringing out their ruach and the Chaya that is the secret man was male and female didn't count only in straightness and then he was male and female exactly also man that is the name of mah numerically Adam and he came in straightness and came out from the lights of the forehead also understand how this name of mah and it is in ZA and in yetzira that is the aspect of ruach this is the ruach of points:",

                "7": "8. And we explain now the reason why points circles moreso than other lights of back to face. And the idea is know that the light of the eyes are not similar to other lights because the eye when man in one ruach and one side they are able to notice all their needs and to move their seeing with their eye only they dont move their body and head at all but they move their eyes and look to the sides moreso then lights like the lights of back to face whos air comes out bemishor therefore the lights that come out with straightness are made in the aspect of straightness but the nikkudim that come out from the aspect of eyes they spread out around Adam Kadmon by way of circles a second reason since the upper lights come out by way of tube of the mouth or nose or ears therefore they are left straight moreso in the points of air that comes out from nhy of Adam Kadmon it splits into vessels of Adam Kadmon and exits out in the secret of and after oori nakfu zot that the light is inside and nokef and strikes the skin and goes out from all sides the entire man and if the stomach was open and the light came out from there to the nikudim the points would be in straightness according to the light of the stomach and kilucho in straightness but this light comes out from all sides of the skin by way of gumot and hairs that is on the skin therefore the points are circles third reason and we explain also the second reason better. And it is didnt we explain in another place the idea of the 2nd tzimtzum of Adam Kadmon because in order to emanate these points we need to restrict the lights of nhy and half of tiferet above and it is called the first curtain created in the place of the stomach and this light that was there first comes out by way of the eyes and from there it goes out and descends downwards towards nhy of Adam Kadmon from outside and there nithavu the points and when this light rises up it goes by way of mayin nukvin and a new light comes out and descends by way of the inner of this man and goes down by way of curtain and goes down to nhy of this man and splits this new inner light from there and goes out the way of the skin and from there it lights to the points and afterwards oori nikafu zot in the 2nd reason we find that these points are made by these two lights points are made through the 2 lights the light goes out and it is the first light and through the inner light which is new and splits and goes out and behold this inner light goes And it is the first light and through the inner light which is new and splits and goes out and behold this inner light goes out from all sides beyond the skin and therefore circles are Made as mentioned in the second reason there is also another reason that since the first light was in the place of the chest and there its source remains to lighten outwards and when the new light descends it meets together the three lights the light of adam kadmon itself from the aspect of its tiferet and also the first light that comes up from nhy and a new light and therefore they press together hard alot and specifically when it goes over and goes to enlighten nhy it needs to strongly split this spreading and go over and descend therefore from this strength of these aspects that it splits and goes out from the skin to lighten these points it goes out with heavy strength and is made into an circle the third reason is because the first light has great pressure because it comes from the eyes it goes out strongly from the eyes and it comes from the eyes. It goes out strongly from the eyes and made a circle However the inner light that spreads from all sides it desires to attach all the tubes by lights this from this and hit it strongly as we learned therefore the tubes of circles of lights by tubes coming out in the aspect of face and surround and touches with the tubes that come out from behind and connect and the round light from this we understand how the eyes hints to netzach. Hod because the light of netzach and hod of this Adam Kadmon goes out from the eyes therefore netzach and hod hints to the eyes",

To give him Mochin is humiliating herself and bowing to the secret of the mother lying on the chicks and then he must raise Rishi thighs very high and in the core of her down below them and then found that the opinion below Chabad and the son is indeed ", 
                "0": "And we see when these points spread out from the outside from next navel of AK until the end of his legs as above, the same light that came anew in the inner by way of a curtain as above and go out and illuminate the points and we find that this new light passes through first and goes by way of the curtain down below the lower half from the belly  After that, it reappears and emerges through the walls of the body and goes out and illuminates the dots. It is written in the book of corrections, one curtain is  between the crown and the highest of the high, for each aspect of the emanator alone is called the highest of the high . But these points that were spread from belly of AK until the end of his feet, as the ZON order, which is enclothed in Arich Anpin, but there Zon is enclothed  in Arich Anpin on all sides  and the surrounding areas, but here the source of illumination is only through the face of AK, But it spreads a little illumination from these points whether of the grade of their lights or vessels and they are enclothed this AK from all sides the way we explained above in Achor Panim but most of the illumination is through the face, and the crown is from the points whose  place is from the navel of AK until the end of the body, and HBD is  in the first three perakim of NHY of AK and HGT, in the middle three perakim and NHY in the lower three perakim by way we mentioned in Zun that enclothes Arich Anpin as mentioned in its place and there is two lights that goes out from the body of AK and they are one from the belly and the second from the mouth of Yesod and they go out from there 2 breaths and according to what it should be there should be three breaths according to the three firsts that were taken from the achor panim as mentioned but according to the lack of light the ear from Abba and Imma as above so therefore missing also is the aspect of breath that is according to the ear and only 2 breaths came out that are according to the nose And mouth alone, from which they received Abba and Imma to above, and here too also below are received from them but the light of the seven lower that is only taken from the body  is from the end of the beard and below as mentioned therefore they dont have breaths to illuminate them but it is hinted to in the secret of the pasuk  ויפוזו זרועי ידיו  That is the secret of  it emanated from his fingernails is mentioned in Tikkun  69 as it was known that they themselves are the aspect of Kings are because the cancellation of the kings was because they were not yet corrected as a human being male and  female. This is the secret of Joseph's seed tips that came out without a female but from a male alone , and they are the ten killed by kings  and understand well the word king that they are really those seven kings who broke their vessels and bodies. And the reason was also because there was no correction of them  until Hadar king 8 then they were rectified  This is also the secret of what is written in Tractate Shavuot in pg. 3 Whoever his wife said to him at the time of his being unclean, his fingernails will stick in the ground, and the seed will come out through the fingernails of the feet, and will spread out . 'And the points that are similar to kings these are the seven that came out from the nails of the feet and even though there are 10 nails  and the points that broke were 7 lower only as mentioned The point is that there are also two types of achorayim  of Abba and Imma that came off we see there are 9 aspects and the tenth  is that even from the crown there was some flaw in it, as it is written before that they were the aspect of NHY of it that came forth and was in the secret of brains to father and mother  And they too were broken and they were 10 according to the ten breaths that came out from the nails of the feet and all grades of coming out are these 10 breaths,by way of the nails were in the aspect of not being able to receive from the light of the upper ear  as mentioned therefore this idea caused all of this including the nullification of the kings."
