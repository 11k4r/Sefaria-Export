            "1": "He hath formed, weighed, transmuted, composed, and created with these twenty-two letters every living being, and every soul yet uncreated.", 
            "0": "The foundations are the twenty-two letters, three 'mothers', seven 'double', and twelve 'single letters'. Three 'mothers', namely Aleph, Mem, Shin, represent Air, Water, and Fire: Aleph mute as Water, Shin hissing as Fire, and Mem as air of a spiritual type, is as balance, standing erect between them and pointing out the equilibrium which exists, speaking.", 
            "3": "These twenty-two letters, the foundations, He arranged as on a sphere, with two hundred and thirty-one modes. If the sphere be rotated forward, good is implied, if in a retrograde manner evil is intended.", 
            "2": "Twenty-two letters are formed by the voice, impressed on the air, and audibly uttered in five situations: in the throat as guttural sounds; in the palate as palatals; by the tongue as linguals; through the teeth as dentals; and by the lips as labial sounds.", 
            "5": "He hewed, as it were, immense columns or colossal pillars, out of the intangible air, and from the empty space. And this is the impress of the whole, twenty-one letters, all from one the Aleph.", 
            "4": "For He indeed showed the mode of combination of the letters, each with each, Aleph with all, and all with Aleph. Thus in combining all together in pairs are produced these two hundred and thirty-one gates of knowledge. And from Nothingness did He make something, and all forms of speech and every created thing, and from the empty void He made the solid earth, and from the non-existent He brought forth Life."
