And by seeing that your intention is honest and good enough by your question, I had to let you know which way to spread light and what is the way that HaShem Almighty desires or does not desire. And when you get to know this then call HaShem to response. And you will be closest to him. And love Him with all your soul, and rejoyce on HaShem. And He will give you the answers of your heart."
