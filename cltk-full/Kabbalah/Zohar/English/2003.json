                "0": "1.Rabbi Chizkiyah opened the discussion with the verse, \"As the lily amongst the thorns\" (Shir Hashirim/Song of Songs 2:2).HE ASKS: What is the lily? AND HE REPLIES: It is the Community of Yisrael (Israel), WHICH IS MALCHUT. Because there is a lily; and there is a lily. Just as the lily among the thorns is tinged with red and white, so is the Community of Yisrael affected by the qualities of judgment and mercy. Just as the lily has thirteen petals, so the Community of Yisrael is surrounded by the thirteen attributes of Mercy. Thus, between the first mention of the name Elohim, WHICH APPEARS IN THE PASSAGE, \"IN THE BEGINNING ELOHIM CREATED\" (BERESHEET/Genesis 1:1) TO THE SECOND MENTION OF ELOHIM, THERE ARE THIRTEEN WORDS IN THE VERSE, WHICH TRANSLATE AS \"THE, HEAVEN, AND THE, EARTH, AND THE EARTH, WAS, WITHOUT FORM, AND VOID, AND DARKNESS, WAS UPON, THE FACE, OF THE DEEP, AND THE SPIRIT\" (IBID. 2). These words surround and guard the Community of Yisrael."
