                "5": "It is compared ... To a lovely princess, Beautiful in every way and hidden deep within her palace. She has one lover, unknown to anyone; he is hidden too. Out of his love for her, this lover passes by her gate constantly, Lifting his eyes to every side. She knows that her lover is hovering about her gate constantly. What does she do? She opens a little window in her hidden palace and reveals her face to her lover, Then swiftly withdraws, concealing herself. No one near the lover sees or reflects, Only the lover, And his heart and his soul and everything within him flow out to her. And he knows that out of love for him She revealed herself for that one moment to awaken (love in him). So is the words of the God in the Torah, she doesn't reveal itself only to her lover."

This is symbolized by one who begins preparations for ushering in the Sabbath on the afternoon of the sixth day. In the same way, toward the end of the sixth millennium, preparations are made for entering the seventh. The hint for this is “In the 600th year of Noah’s life ... all the wellsprings of the great deep burst forth and the flood gates of the heavens were opened."

See, it has been said, a man ought always to cleave to his wife that the Schekina may always be with him, yet it is possible to go alone on a journey and the Schekina will still be with him. And when doing so he ought to direct his prayer to the Holy One that this may be, and in this way the male and female will always be associated in union with oneself.", 
                "7": "Then Rabbi Simeon said: \"It is written, 'and he went on his journeys from the south to Bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai' (Gen. 13:3). It says, 'He went on his journeys' instead of 'his journey.' Why is that? There is a reference not only to his own journeying, but also that of the Schekina, who always went with Jacob, and therefore we learn that every person needs to be male and female at all time, for the sake of his faith, he ought not to think or imagine that the Schekina forsakes", 
                "6": "Rabbi Simeon was journeying to Tiberias, and there were with him, Rabbi Jose, Rabbi Jehuda, and Rabbi Hiya. While on the way, they saw Rabbi Pinchus coming to meet them. After exchanging greetings, they all sat down under a great shady tree by a hillside. Then Rabbi Pinchus said: \"now that we are seated, please instruct me further in the Secret Doctrine, that you are teaching daily.\""

As it is written “with knowledge chambers are filled\" (Proverbs 24:4). (Because of this) other knowledge is not revealed, as it is hidden and departed into the substance and contained in it. Knowledge illuminates the brain and spreads out to the entire brain (in the brain, in the body entirely “for a G-d of knowledge is Hashem”)."
