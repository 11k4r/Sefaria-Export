Out of his love for her, this lover passes by her gate constantly, Lifting his eyes to every side. She knows that her lover is hovering about her gate constantly. What does she do? She opens a little window in her hidden palace and reveals her face to her lover, Then swiftly withdraws, concealing herself. No one near the lover sees or reflects, Only the lover, And his heart and his soul and everything within him flow out to her. And he knows that out of love for him She revealed herself for that one moment to awaken (love in him). So is the words of the God in the Torah, she doesn't reveal itself only to her lover.",

Also it is written, makes the earth, and not made, because God constantly regulates the earth and its activities through the agency of His strength, as just explained...  R. Isaac said: It is written, By the word of the Lord the heavens were made and by the breath of his mouth all their hosts. The heavens mentioned here are the lower heavens, which were made by the word of the upper heavens, through the spirit which sent forth a voice until it reached that stream which issues and flows perennially. By all their hosts is meant the lower world, which exists through that breath, which is male. A similar lesson is derived from the verse, Who watereth the mountains from his upper chambers, the earth is full of the fruit of thy works (Ps. CIV, 13). The upper chambers we have already explained, and the term can be further illustrated by the verse, Who lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters. The expression the fruit of thy works alludes to that stream which ever flows and issues forth; hence it is written, Yielding fruit whose seed is in it, as explained.\n"
