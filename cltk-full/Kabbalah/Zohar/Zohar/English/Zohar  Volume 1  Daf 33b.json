                "15": "R. Hiya said: It is written, \"God maketh the earth by his strength\" (Jer. X, 12). He who \"maketh the earth\" is the Holy One, blessed be He, above; \"by his strength\" means by the Zaddik; \"he establishes the universe, this is the earth beneath; \"by his wisdom, refers to Zedek (justice). Also it is written, \"makes the earth, and not \"made, because God constantly regulates the earth and its activities through the agency of His \"strength, as just explained... ",
                "18": "R. Isaac said: It is written, \"By the word of the Lord the heavens were made and by the breath of his mouth all their hosts.\" The \"heavens\" mentioned here are the lower heavens, which were made by the word of the upper heavens, through the spirit which sent forth a voice until it reached that stream which issues and flows perennially. By \"all their hosts\" is meant the lower world, which exists through that \"breath, which is male. ",
                "19": "A similar lesson is derived from the verse, \"Who watereth the mountains from his upper chambers, the earth is full of the fruit of thy works\" (Ps. CIV, 13). The \"upper chambers\" we have already explained, and the term can be further illustrated by the verse, \"Who lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters.\" The expression \"the fruit of thy works\" alludes to that stream which ever flows and issues forth; hence it is written, \"Yielding fruit whose seed is in it,\" as explained."
