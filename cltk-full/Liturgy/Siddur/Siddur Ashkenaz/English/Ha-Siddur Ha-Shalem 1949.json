On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place at a distance. Then Abraham said to his servants: \"You stay here with the ass while I and the boy go yonder: we will worship and come back to you.\" So Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on his son Isaac, while he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and the two of them went off together. Then Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said: \"My father\"; and he answered: \"Here I am, my son.\" And he said: \"Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?\" Abraham answered: \"God will provide himself with the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.\" So the two of them went on together. They came to a place which God had told him, and Abraham built the altar there, arrange the wood, bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham put out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from the heavens: \"Abraham, Abraham,\" and he answered: \"Here I am.\" He said: \"Do not lay your hand on the boy, and do nothing to him; for I know now that you revere God, seeing that you have not refused me your son, your only son.\" Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; so Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it as a burnt-offering instead of his son. Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-yireh, as it is said to this day: \"The mount where the Lord reveals himself.\" The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from the heavens, and said: \"By myself I swear,\" says the Lord, \"that since you have done this, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, I will indeed bless you, and will surely make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky or as the sands on the seashore; your descendants shall possess the cities of their enemies, and through your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed—because you have obeyed my voice.\" Abraham then returned to his servants, and they started together for Beersheba, for Abraham dwelt in Beersheba."

Lord my God, I cried to You, and You did heal me. O Lord, You have lifted me up from the grave; You have let me live, that I should not go down to the pit. Sing to the Lord, you who are godly, and give thanks to his holy name. For his anger only lasts a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may lodge with us at evening, but in the morning there are shouts of joy. I thought in my security I would never be shaken. O Lord, by Your favor You established my mountain as stronghold; but when Your favor was withdrawn, I was dismayed. To You, O Lord, I called; I appealed to my God: \"What profit would my blood be, if I went down to the grave? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness? Hear, O Lord, and be gracious to me; Lord, be my helper.\" You have changed my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and girded me with joy; so that my soul may praise You, and not be silent. Lord my God, I will thank You forever."

Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth exult, and let them say among the nations, \"The Lord is King!\" The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for all time. The Lord is King for evermore; the heathen have vanished from his land. The Lord annuls the counsel of nations; He foils the plans of peoples. Many are the plans in man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that shall stand. The Lord's purpose stands forever; His plans are through all generations. For He spoke, and the world came into being; He commanded, and it stood firm. Surely the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation. Surely, the Lord has chosen Jacob to be His, and Israel as His prized possession. Surely, the Lord will not abandon His people, nor forsake His heritage. He, being merciful, forgives iniquity, and does not destroy; frequently He turns his anger away, and does not stir up all His wrath. O Lord, save us; may the King answer us when we call."
