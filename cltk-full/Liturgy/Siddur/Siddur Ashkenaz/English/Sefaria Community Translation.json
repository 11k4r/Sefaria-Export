Though You abide at the pinnacle of the universe, Your just decrees extend to the ends of the earth.  Happy the one who obeys Your mitzvot, who takes to heart the words of Your Torah.  You are, in truth, a mentor to Your people, their defender and mighty Ruler.  You are first and You are last; we have no Sovereign or Redeemer but You.  You rescued us from Egypt, and redeemed us from the house of bondage.  The firstborn of the Egyptians were slain; Your firstborn were saved.  You split the waters of the sea.  The faithful You rescued; the wicked drowned.  The waters engulfed Israel's enemies; not one of the arrogant remained alive.  Then Your beloved sang hymns of acclamation, extolling you with psalms of adoration.  They acclaimed G-d Sovereign, great and awesome Source of all blessing, the everliving G-d, exalted in all majesty.  G-d humbles the proud and raises the lowly, frees the captive and redeems the meek.  G-d helps the needy and answers G-d's people's call.  Praises to G-d supreme, who is ever praised.  Moses and the people Israel joyfully sang this song to you.  \"Who is like you, Adonai, among all that is worshipped!  Who is, like You, majestic in holiness, awesome in splendor, working wonders!\"  The redeemed sang a new song for You.  They sang in chorus at the shore of the sea, acclaiming Your sovereignty: \"Adonai shall reign throughout all time.\"  Rock of Israel, arise to Israel's defense.  Fulfill Your promise to deliver Judah and Israel.  Our Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Adonai Tz'va-ot.  Praised are You, Adonai, Redeemer of the people Israel.  "
