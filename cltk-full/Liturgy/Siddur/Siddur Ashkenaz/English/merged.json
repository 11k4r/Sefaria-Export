On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place at a distance. Then Abraham said to his servants: \"You stay here with the ass while I and the boy go yonder: we will worship and come back to you.\" So Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on his son Isaac, while he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and the two of them went off together. Then Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said: \"My father\"; and he answered: \"Here I am, my son.\" And he said: \"Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?\" Abraham answered: \"God will provide himself with the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.\" So the two of them went on together. They came to a place which God had told him, and Abraham built the altar there, arrange the wood, bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham put out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from the heavens: \"Abraham, Abraham,\" and he answered: \"Here I am.\" He said: \"Do not lay your hand on the boy, and do nothing to him; for I know now that you revere God, seeing that you have not refused me your son, your only son.\" Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; so Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it as a burnt-offering instead of his son. Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-yireh, as it is said to this day: \"The mount where the Lord reveals himself.\" The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from the heavens, and said: \"By myself I swear,\" says the Lord, \"that since you have done this, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, I will indeed bless you, and will surely make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky or as the sands on the seashore; your descendants shall possess the cities of their enemies, and through your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed—because you have obeyed my voice.\" Abraham then returned to his servants, and they started together for Beersheba, for Abraham dwelt in Beersheba."

Sing to the Lord, you who are godly, and give thanks to his holy name. For his anger only lasts a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may lodge with us at evening, but in the morning there are shouts of joy. I thought in my security I would never be shaken. O Lord, by Your favor You established my mountain as stronghold; but when Your favor was withdrawn, I was dismayed. To You, O Lord, I called; I appealed to my God: \"What profit would my blood be, if I went down to the grave? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness? Hear, O Lord, and be gracious to me; Lord, be my helper.\" You have changed my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and girded me with joy; so that my soul may praise You, and not be silent. Lord my God, I will thank You forever."

You are, in truth, a mentor to Your people, their defender and mighty Ruler.  You are first and You are last; we have no Sovereign or Redeemer but You.  You rescued us from Egypt, and redeemed us from the house of bondage.  The firstborn of the Egyptians were slain; Your firstborn were saved.  You split the waters of the sea.  The faithful You rescued; the wicked drowned.  The waters engulfed Israel's enemies; not one of the arrogant remained alive.  Then Your beloved sang hymns of acclamation, extolling you with psalms of adoration.  They acclaimed G-d Sovereign, great and awesome Source of all blessing, the everliving G-d, exalted in all majesty.  G-d humbles the proud and raises the lowly, frees the captive and redeems the meek.  G-d helps the needy and answers G-d's people's call.  Praises to G-d supreme, who is ever praised.  Moses and the people Israel joyfully sang this song to you.  \"Who is like you, Adonai, among all that is worshipped!  Who is, like You, majestic in holiness, awesome in splendor, working wonders!\"  The redeemed sang a new song for You.  They sang in chorus at the shore of the sea, acclaiming Your sovereignty: \"Adonai shall reign throughout all time.\"  Rock of Israel, arise to Israel's defense.  Fulfill Your promise to deliver Judah and Israel.  Our Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel, Adonai Tz'va-ot.  Praised are You, Adonai, Redeemer of the people Israel.  "
