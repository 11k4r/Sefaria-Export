For there they who carried us away captive asked us for a song; and they who spoiled us asked us for mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Żiyyon. How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land? If I forget thee, O Yerushalayim, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I do not set Yerushalayim above my highest joy. Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom the day of Yerushalayim, when they said, Rase it, rase it, to its very foundations. O daughter of Bavel, marked for devastation; happy is he who shall repay thee thy recompense for what thou hast done to us. Happy is he who shall seize and dash thy little ones against the rock."
