And You are He who conducts them, and there is no one who conducts You, neither above, nor below, nor from any side.You arranged garments for them, from which fly souls to mankind. And You arranged many bodies for them, which are called \"bodies\" compared to \"garments\" which cover them and are named in this arrangement: Chesed [Loving-kindness], the right arm. Gevurah [Might, severity], the left arm. Tiferet [Harmony], the torso. Netzach [Victory] and Hod [Glory] the two thighs. Yesod [Foundation, bonding], the culmination of the body, the sign of the Holy Covenant [the circumcision]. Malchut [Kingship], the mouth; she is called the Oral Torah. Chochmah [Wisdom], the brain; that is inner thought. Binah [Understanding], the heart; with her, the heart understands. Of these two, it is written (Deuteronomy 29:28), \"The hidden things belong to Havayah Elokeinu [the L‑rd our G‑d].\" Supernal Keter [Crown] - this is the Crown of Kingship [Keter of Malchut; alt. this Keter is Malchut], and regarding her it is said (Isaiah 46:10), \"From the beginning [Keter] He tells the end [Malchut].\" And this is the skull of the inner tefillin; that is the 45-Name [the Divine Name \"Mah\", spelled יו\"ד ה\"א וא\"ו ה\"א‬], which is the path of Atzilut.

And with them You conceal Yourself from humankind. And You are He Who binds them and unifies them, and to the extent that You are within them, anyone who will separate one among these ten sefirot from its fellows is considered as if he made a separation within You.",

And You created the Heavens and the earth, and sent out from them the sun, the moon, the stars [planets included] and the constellations. And on earth [You sent out], trees, grasses, the Garden of Eden, shrubs, beasts, animals, birds, fish and humankind - to make known through them the things on High, and how You conduct the things on High and Below, and how You make known to them the things on High from the things Below, and there is none that knows You at all. And aside from You, there is no unity on High or Below. And You are acknowledged [as] the Cause of everything and the Master of everything."
