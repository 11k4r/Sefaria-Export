You must fear Adonoy, your God, serve Him, cleave to Him, and swear by His Name. He is your praise, and He is your God, Who did with you all these great and awesome things that your eyes have seen. With seventy people your fathers descended to Egypt, and now Adonoy, your God, has made you as abundant as the stars of heaven.

And what He did unto Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them, and their households, their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel.

These six psalms, 145-150, are an essential component of our daily prayers. Our Sages attach much significance to Psalm 145 in particular, and stated: \"Whoever recites ‘A praise by David' three times a day is assuredly worthy of a share in the world to come\" (<i>Maseches Berachos</i> 4b). When recited in prayer this psalm is always introduced with two verses from other Psalms (84:5 and 144:15). These verses contain the word fortunate three times, an allusion to this psalm being recited three times a day.

Bake what you want to bake, and cook what you want to cook and whatever is left over, put away carefully until morning. They put it away until morning as Moses commanded, and it did not become putrid, and there were no worms in it. Then Moses said, \"Eat it today, for today is Adonoy's Shabbos. Today you will not find [manna] in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but the seventh day is Shabbos; there will be no [manna] on that day.\" But it happened on the seventh day that some of the people went out to gather [manna] but they found nothing.",

But when then they measured it with an <i>omer,</i> the one who took more did not have extra, and the one who took less was not lacking. Each one had gathered according to his required nourishment. Moses said to them, \"Let jo one leave any of it over until morning.\" But some did not listen to Moses and left part of it over until the morning. It turned wormy and became putrid; and Moses was angry at them; they gathered it each morning, every man according to what he needed. The sun then became hot and it melted.",

Every man must remain in his place; no man may leave his designated place on the seventh day.\" So the people rested on the seventh day. The House of Israel named the food <i>manna.</i> It was like white coriander seed and it tasted like dough kneaded with honey. Moses said, \"This is what Adonoy has commanded, ‘Fill an <i>omer</i> measure with it as a keepsake for your generations, so they will see the food with which I fed you in the wilderness when I took you out of Egypt.\" Moses said to Aaron, \"Take a jar and place an <i>omer</i> full of manna in it, and place it before Adonoy as a keepsake for your generations.\" As Adonoy commanded Moses, so did Aaron place it before the Testimony as a keepsake. The Children of Israel ate the manna for forty years until they came to an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan. The <i>omer</i> is one-tenth of a <i>ephah.</i>"

Its message is that man must utilize all his material and physical resources to enhance his spiritual existence so that when his soul survives the body's brief stay on earth it can ascend to immortality. If man fails to recognize his purpose in life and instead regards the acquisition of material wealth the primary aim of life, he forfeits his hope of immortality, and his existence will not continue beyond the grave.—<i>S.R.
