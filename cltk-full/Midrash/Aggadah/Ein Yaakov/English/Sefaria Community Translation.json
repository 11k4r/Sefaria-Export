A mountain is strong, but iron cleaves it. Iron is strong, but fire melts it. Fire is strong, but water extinguishes it. Water is strong, but clouds bear it. Clouds are strong, but wind disperses them. Wind is strong, but the body withstands it. The body is strong, but fear breaks it. Fear is strong, but wine dispels it. Wine is strong, but sleep drives it off. And death is stronger than them all, but charity saves [a person] from death, as it is stated (Proverbs 10:2, 11:4), 'and charity delivers from death.'\" "
