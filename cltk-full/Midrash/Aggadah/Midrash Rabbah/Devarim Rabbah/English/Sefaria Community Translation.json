This is what the Sages taught: The only difference between scrolls and Tefillin or Mezuzot is that scrolls may be written in any language. Rabban Gamliel says: One is not even permitted for scrolls unless they are written in Greek. What is Rabban Gamliel's reasoning that one it is permissible to write a Torah scroll in Greek? This is how our Rabbis taught: Bar Kappara said: It is written, \"May God extend Yephet, may he dwell in the tents of Shem,\" (Gen. 9:27) that the words of Shem may be spoken in the language of Yephet - therefore it is permitted that they be written in the Greek language. The Holy Blessed One said: See how the language of the Torah is so dear that it heals the tongue! From where do we know this? Since it is written, \"A healing tongue is a tree of life,\" (Pro. 15:4) and the \"tree of life\" only refers to the Torah, as it is said, \"it is a tree of life to those who grasp onto her,\" (Pro. 3:18). The language of the Torah makes the tongue fluent. ",

The Sages have thus taught (Talmud Berachot 31a): When one stands and prays, he may make his voice heard. Hannah had already demonstrated this (1 Samuel 1:13): 'But Hannah was speaking in her heart.' One might think that she prayed all three blessings together. But Daniel had already clarified this (Daniel 6:11): 'He blessed his God three times a day.' One might think that one may pray whenever he wishes. But David had already clarified this (Psalms 55:18): 'In the evening, morning, and afternoon I express my grief and moan; and He hears my voice.' One might think that one may request his needs and they will be fulfilled immediately. But Solomon had already clarified this (1 Kings 8:28):\"To listen to the singing and to the prayer, the singing is the voice of the Holy One, blessed be He, and the prayer is for the needs of man. Abba Shaul says, this is a sign for prayer: if a person directs his heart towards prayer, he can be assured that his prayer will be heard, as it says (Psalm 10:17): You prepare their heart, You listen closely with Your ear. Rabbi Yochanan says, prayer is called by ten names, and these are they:\" \"Prepare your hearts, and listen, O you who hears. Rabbi Yochanan said there are ten types of speech that are called prayer, and these are they: crying out, shouting, groaning, singing, whispering, crying, a broken heart, supplication, and beseeching. Crying out and shouting, as it is said, 'And the children of Israel cried out' (Exodus 2:23). Groaning, as it is said, 'God heard their groaning' (Psalms 106:44). Singing and reciting, as it is said, 'Do not pray for this people… and do not raise up a cry or prayer on their behalf' (Jeremiah 7:16). Whispering and calling out, as it is said, 'In my distress, I called upon the Lord' (Psalms 18:7). Crying and brokenheartedness, as it is said, 'And I fell down before the Lord' (Deuteronomy 9:18). Supplication, as it is said, 'And Pinchas stood up and prayed' (Psalms 106:30). And of them all, Moses only prayed in the language of beseeching. Rabbi Yochanan said: 'From where did Moses learn this? From the verse, \"And now, let the strength of my Lord be great, as You have spoken, saying…\"' (Numbers 14:17).\" \"And I will show mercy to whomever I will show mercy,\" He said to him, \"and I will be gracious to whomever I will be gracious. For whoever has something in my hands, I will show mercy to him with the measure of mercy that I do, but for whoever does not have something in my hands, I will give freely to him as a gift. And at the time when Moses was seeking to enter the land of Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, 'It is enough for you.' He said before Him, 'Master of the Universe, did You not say to me that whoever does not have something in my hands, I will give freely to him as a gift?' Now I am not saying that I am seeking anything from You, but rather do something for me freely. From where do I know this? From what we have learned in the matter: 'And I pleaded with the Lord.'\" (Exodus 33:19; Deuteronomy 3:26)",

Alternately, (Deuteronomy 4:25) <i> \"When you have begotten children...\" </i> This accords with what the verse says (Proverbs 10:16) <i> \"The labor of the righteous man makes for life; The produce of the wicked man makes for want.\" </i> \"The labor of the righteous man makes for life\"- Rabbi Tanchum says: This refers to Eliphaz, who grew up in Isaac's bosom. \"The produce of the wicked man makes for want\"- This refers to Amalek, who grew up in Esav's bosom. Alternately, \"The labor of the righteous man makes for life\"- All that David and his son Shlomo did, for life for Israel. Then what is meant by \"The produce of the wicked man makes for want (\"chatat\")\"? Through one act of entrance (\"biah\"), when Menashe went inside the Holy of Holies, all of Israel experienced a misdirection (\"chataya\"), since he made an image with four faces and placed it inside the Temple. Where is the source for this? As it is said, (Ezekiel 8:5) <i> \"And there, north of the gate of the altar, was that infuriating image on the approach (\"biah\").\" </i> Rabbi Acha says: What a great travesty (\"biya\") for the world that the visitor cleared out the master of the house. And why did he make an image with four faces? To parallel the four Chayot who carry the throne of the Holy Blessed One. Alternately, why four faces? To parallel the four directions in the world, as if to say: Anyone who comes from the four directions of the world will bow to this image. And what did the Holy Blessed One do to him? He gave him over to the hand of his enemies. Where is the source for this? As it is said (II Chronicles 33:11) <i> So the LORD brought against them the officers of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh captive in manacles, bound him in fetters.\" </i>  They made for him a mule of copper and put him inside it, and they would light a fire underneath it and he would be burned inside it. At that hour, Menashe called out to every deity in the world that he had sacrificed to, and not one of them answered him. As it is said, (Isaiah 46:7) <i> \"If they cry out to it, it does not answer; It cannot save them from their distress.\" </i> When Menashe saw that his distress was distressing, that not one of them had answered him, he began to call out to the Holy Blessed One. He said before Him, \"Master of the world, behold I have called out to every deity in the world, and I realize that there is nothing real to them. Master of the world, You are God over all gods, and if You do not answer me, I will say, Heaven forbid, that all of the options are the same [i.e. that you are not real either].\" The Holy Blessed One said to him, \"Oh wicked person! According to the rules, I should not answer you, since you angered Me. But in order not to lock the door before those who repent, so they do not say, 'Behold Menashe tried to repent and was not accepted,' for this reason I will answer you.\" As it is said, (II Chronicles 33:13) <i>  \"He prayed to Him, and He granted (\"ye'ater\") his prayer.\" </i> He tunneled (\"yachtor\") for him. This teaches that the ministering angels would close the windows of the firmament so that his [Menashe's] prayer would not rise up to the Heavens. What did the Holy Blessed One do? He tunneled through the firmament below the Throne of Glory and accepted his prayer. (II Chronicles 33:13) <i> \"And He returned him to Jerusalem to his kingdom.\" </i>  Rabbi Shmuel bar Onya says citing Rabbi Acha: He returned him through wind, as you say, \"Who makes the wind blow (literally 'return').\" At that hour, (II Chronicles 33:13) <i> \"Manasseh knew that the LORD alone was God.\" </i> Alternately,  (Proverbs 10:16) <i> \"The labor of the righteous man makes for life;\" </i> These are the righteous people who lived at the time of Moshe.  <i>  \"The produce of the wicked man makes for want.\" </i> (Deuteronomy 4:25) <i> \"When you have begotten children and children’s children and are long established in the land...\" </i>",

Our Sages taught as follows:  Betrothal and marriage documents are written only with the assent of both parties, and the groom provides the payment.  From whom do we learn this?  From the Holy One Blessed be He, when He betrothed Israel on Sinai, as it is written (Ex. 19:10), \"Adonai said to Moses, “Go to the people and warn them to stay pure today and tomorrow.\"  And who wrote this document?  Moshe.  Whence?  As it says (Deut. 31:9), \"Moses wrote down this (Song) Teaching.\"  And what payment did the Holy One Blessed be He provide for him?

Resh Lakish said,\"The Torah was given to Moshe, its skin of white fire and written with black fire, and sealed in fire, and wrapped with fire.  And while he was writing, he wiped his pen-reed on his hair, and from there he acquired the splendor of his face.\"  R' Shmuel bar Nahman said, \"It was from the tablets that Moshe acquired the splendor of his face.

Had you [only] called Potiphar's wife to account for me, but not given me the powers of a sovereign, I would have been joyful and happy, now that you've also given me the powers of a sovereign, I will exult and rejoice in your loving-kindness.\" \"When you notice my affliction\", this [too] refers to Joseph, about whom it is written, \"His feet were afflicted in fetters; an iron collar was put on his neck\" (psalms 105:18). \"and did not hand me over to my enemy\" - this is Potiphar [who sought to imprison Joseph for life]. \"but grant me relief\", since he caused me to rule over the entire land of Egypt. From where is this derived? From the verse: \"Now Joseph was the vizier of the land; it was he who dispensed rations to all the people of the land...\" (Genesis 42:6).

Our rabbis say that the ant has three houses (or floors), and it does not congregate in the top (floor) because of rain, nor does in the bottom because of mud, but rather in the middle. And it only lives for six months. Why? Because anything that does not have sinews or bones only lives six months. And all of its food is a grain and a half. And it goes and gathers in the summer all that it finds, grain and barley and lentils. Rabbi Tanchuma said: All of its life is a grain and a half and (yet) it gathers these? And why does it do this? Because it says: Perhaps the Holy One Blessed Be He will decree life and it will be prepared for me to eat. Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said: It once happened that they found a pit of it (an ant) that had three hundred kor (of food grains). What they gather from the summer is for the winter, therefore Solomon said: \"Lazybones, go to the ant; study its ways and learn.\" So to you shall fix for yourselves mitzvot from this world for the world to come.

How do we know? As it says: (Jeremiah 17:7) \"Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose hope is the Lord.\" But anyone who places trusts in pagan worship, he becomes indebted to be like it. How do we know? As it says, (Psalms 115:8) \"May they who make them become like them, [and everyone who trusts in them.]\" Our rabbis said: Anyone who relies on man transgresses, even for his protection, he transgresses, for it says, (Psalms 146:3), \"...in humans who cannot save.\" What does it say afterwards? (Psalms 146:4) \"His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth.\" Says the Holy One, blesses be He: They know that humans are nothing, yet they put aside My Glory and say: \"Appoint for us a king\"? What do you want a king for? By your lives, your end will be to feel what will happen to you in the future under the reign of your kings!\" How do we know? As it says, (Hosea 7:7) \"All their kings have fallen; there is none among them who call me.\"",
            "9": "Alternatively: (Deuteronomy 17:14) \"And you will say, 'I will appoint for me a king...\" - Rabbi Yehudah said in the name of Rabbi Ilai: Israel was commanded about three things in their entrance to the land, and these are they: to erase the memory of Amalek, to appoint for them a king, and to build for them the Holy Temple. They appointed a king and they erased the memory of Amalek, why did they not [immediately] build the Holy Temple? Because there were informers amongst them. You should know, that Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman said: Achav's generation were pagan worshippers, yet they went out to war and won. Why was this so? Because they did not have informers amongst them. Therefore they went out to war and won. You should know that when Ezevel wanted to murder all of the prophets of God, what did Ovadia do? He hid them in caves, as it says, (I Kings 18:13) \"...how I hid a hundred men if the Lord's prophets by fifties in a cave...\" And there wasn't anybody who told Achav, \"Such and such did Ovadia do.\" But in Shaul's generation, they were all informers. You should know, that when Shaul was chasing after David, they all tattled to Shaul, as it says, (Psalms 52:2) \"When Doeg the Adamite came...\" (Psalms 54:2) \"When the Ziphites came and said to Shaul...\" Therefore, they fell in war. Differently: Said Rabbi Minah: Anyone who speaks ill [of others] causes the Presence to leave from below to above. You should know, what does David say? (Psalms 57:5) \"My soul is among lions; I must lie among those who breathe forth fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows And their tongue a sharp sword.\" And what does it state afterwards? (Psalms 57:6) \"Be exalted, O God, above the heavens...\" Said David, \"Master of the World! What is the Presence doing below? Remove the Presence to the firmament!\" Differently: Said Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman: Why is speaking ill of others called \"the third speaking\"? Because it murders three: The speaker, the accepter, the person spoken about. How do we know this? Doeg the speaker, Shaul the accepter, and Nov, the city of priests that was spoken about. Alternatively: Said Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman: They asked the snake, \"Why are you found amongst the fences?\" It responded, \"For I breached the fence of the world!\" They said to him, \"Why do you walk on the ground and have your tongue drink up the ground?\" He said, \"It was caused to me for I spoke ill about the Creator.\" \"What was his ill speaking? Rabbi Yehoshua of Siknin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, \"The first snake spoke like a human. Since Adam and Eve did not want to eat from that tree, it began to speak ill of its Creator. It said: The Creator ate from that tree and created His world, so He commanded you not to eat from it and create another world (Cf. Genesis 3:5). So what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He cut off its legs, and mutilated its tongue so that it could not speak. Alternatively: They asked the snake, \"How do you benefit, that you bite so?\" It said, \"Before you ask me why, ask why of those who speak ill of others!\" As its says, (Ecclesiastes 10:11) \"If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the person who speaks [ill of others] (alt: charmer).\" How did he benefit? By speaking ill of others. Alternatively: They said to the snake, \"Why do you bite one limb, yet your poison spreads to all the limbs?\" It said to them, \"Before you ask me why, ask why of those who speak ill of others, who stand in Rome and murder in Syria, who stand in Syria and murder in Rome!\" Come and see how harsh the power of ill speech is, that they were commanded to build a Holy Temple, but because their generation spoke ill of others, it was not built in their day.",
            "10": "Alternatively: (Deuteronomy 17:14) \"And you will say, 'I will appoint for me a king...\" - Our rabbis said: Said the Holy One, blessed be He, \"You want kings in this world. Jewish kings will be appointed, and they will make you fall by the sword.\" Shaul caused them to fall at Mt. HaGilboa. How do we know? (I Samuel 4:17) \"And Israel fled from before the Philistines...\" David caused a plague to be sent, as it says, (II Samuel 24:15) \"And God sent a pestilence to Israel...\" Achav stopped up the rains from them, as it says (I Kings 17:1) \"...there shall not be dew nor rain these years...\" Tzidkiyahu caused the destruction of the Holy Temple. Once Israel saw what happens under the rule of their kings, they all began to cry out, \"We don't want a king of Israel! We want our furst King: (Isaiah 33:22) \"For God is our judge, God is our law-giver, God is our king, He will save us!\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, \"By your lives, thus will I do.\" How do we know? As it says, (Zachariah 14:9) \"And God will be the king over all the earth...\"",
            "13": "Who fulfilled this section (Deuteronomy 20:10-15)? Yehoshua bin Nun. Said Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman: What did Yehoshua do? He put out an edict everywhere he went to conquer, and this is what was written in it: \"Anyone who wants to leave, can leave. Anyone who wants to make peace, make it. Anyone who wants to wage war, wage it.\" What did the Gergashites do? They turned and left from before them, giving the Holy One, blessed be He, a land as beautiful as His land, called Africa. The Gibeonites made peace him, Yehoushua made peace with them. But the 31 kings came to wage war with him, the Holy One, blessed be He, made them fall into his hand. How do we know? As it says, (Deuteronomy 3:3) \"We struck them down, leaving no survivors.\"...",
            "14": "Alternatively, \"proclaim peace unto it\" (Deuteronomy 20), See how great is the power of peace. Come see, a human of flesh and blood, if one has an enemy and wonders what to do to the enemy. What does one do? One goes and honors another greater than the enemy so that as to do evil to the enemy. But the Holy One of Blessing is not like that, rather all the idol worshipers anger God, and they sleep and all the souls rise up to him. From where do we know this? As it says, \"He in Whose hand is the spirit of all life\" (Job 12:10). And in the morning God returns to each and every one their soul. From where do we know this? As it says \"He gives breath to the people upon it\" (Isaiah 42:5). Alternatively: A human of flesh and blood, if one's friend does evil to them, it does not leave their heart for ever. But the Holy One of Blessing is not so, rather Israel was in Egypt and the Egyptians enslaved them with mortar and brick, and after all the evil they did to Israel, the Torah has mercy on them and it says \"You shall not abhor an Egyptian for you were a stranger in his land\" (Deut.23:8), but rather pursue peace as it is written \"seek peace and pursue it\". (Psalms 34:15) Another interpretation: what is \"seek peace and pursue it\"? A story about Rabbi Meir: he was sitting and teaching, etc, that woman went home and it was Friday evening, and she discovered that her [Shabbat] light had gone out and her husband asked her: 'where were you, out this late?' and she answered: 'I was listening to Rabbi Meir expound on Torah.' And that man was a nincompoop, and told her: 'the only way you are getting into my house is if you spit on the face of Rabbi Meir'. And he expelled her from the house. Eliahu Hanavi, may he be mentioned for good, revealed all this to Rabbi Meir, and said to him: 'it was because of you that this woman was expelled from her house.' And Eliahu Hanavi, may he be mentioned for good, informed him of all the drama. What did Rabbi Meir do?He went and sat in the big Beit Midrash, and that woman came to pray and he saw her, and pretended to be blinking [with discomfort], and said in a loud voice: 'who here knows an incantation over the eye? And she said: I know. And she spit on his face. He said to her: now go and tell your husband: I did spit on Rabbi Meir's face, he said: go back to your husband. See! How great is the power of peace. Another word: Rabbi Akiva said: know how great is the power of peace! The Holy One of Blessing said that when a man feels jealous towards his wife the very Holy Name of God which is written in sanctity is to be erased in water, in order to send [a bomb of] peace between a sotah and her husband. Resh Lakish said: so great is peace that Scripture said lying words in order to set peace between Yosef and his brothers. At the time of their father's death they were afraid that he would take revenge upon them, and what did they say \"your father commanded before his death to say: such you will say to Yosef [please forgive your brothers' offense and guilt] (Gen. 50:16-17) and we do not find such a command from Yaakov our father, rather, scripture said lying words because of the ways of peace. Another interpretation: Beloved is peace, that the Holy One of Blessing gave it to Tzion, as it says: \"Ask for the peace of Jerusalem\" (Ps. 122:6). Another interpretation: So beloved is peace, that the Holy One of Blessing gave it to the heaven, as it says: \"The Maker of Peace on His heights / oseh shalom bimromav\" (Job 25:2). Alternatively: So beloved is peace, that the Holy One of Blessing gave it to near ones and far ones, as it says \"Peace peace, to the far and to the near\" (Isaiah 57:19). Alternatively: so beloved is peace, that the Holy One of Blessing did not give it to the wicked, as it says \"There is no peace, said Ad-nai, for the wicked\" (Isaiah 48:22). Alternatively: so beloved is peace, that the Holy One of Blessing  gave it to Pinchas as his reward, as it says \"Behold I give him my covenant of peace\". (Numbers 25:12). Alternatively: So great is peace, that the Holy One of Blessing doesn't announce to Jerusalem that they will be redeemed except in peace, as it says \"Announce peace...\" (Isaiah 52:7). Alternatively: R. Levi said: so beloved is peace, that all the closings of blessings are in peace. The reading of the Shema closes in peace: \"Spread a sukah of peace\", prayer closes in peace, the priestly blessing closes in peace \"And He shall give to you peace\". Alternatively: so beloved is peace, that the Holy One of Blessing only comforts Jerusalem with peace. From where do we know this? As it is written \"Behold I will extend peace to her like a river\" (Isaiah 66:12). David said, 'I asked to hear what the Holy One of Blessing says about Israel, and I heard that God busies Godself with their peace', as it says \"I will hear what God Ad-nai will speak, God will speak peace to His people, and unto his followers\" (Psalms 85:9). R. Shimon Ben Chalafta said: See how beloved peace is, when the Holy One of Blessing wanted to bless Israel he found no vessel that could hold all the blessings to bless them with except for peace. From where do we know this? As it says \"Ad-nai will give strength to his people, Ad-nai will bless his people with peace\" / Ad-nai oz l'amo yiten. (Psalms 29:11)"

So did the sages learn: All [<i>tzaraat</i>] blemishes can a man see except for his own blemishes. Rabbi Meir said, “Also not the blemishes of his relatives.” And through what do blemishes come? Through an evil (stingy) eye. Rabbi Yitschak said, “It is customary in the world that a man should say to his fellow, ‘Lend me your pickaxe, that I should chop this wood.’ And he says [back] to him, ‘I don’t have [one],’ due to an evil eye. So does [the first one] say, ‘By your life, [so] lend me your sieve’; and he has one. And he says, ‘I don’t have [one],’ due to an evil eye. Immediately a blemish comes to his house first. From where [do we know this]? As it states (Leviticus 14:37), ‘And he will see the blemish, and behold the blemish is in the walls.’ And what would they do to him? They would clear out everything that he had inside his house. From where [do we know this]? As it states (Leviticus 14:36), ‘And the priest will command and they will clear out his house.’ When he would remove all of what he had inside his house – his pickaxes and his sieves – they would say, ‘Did you see the evil eye, since he had in his hand that which was in his house [and] he didn’t want to lend [it]. What caused him to clear [it] out? Through his having an evil eye.’” Another [understanding]: Rabbi Chaninah said, “Blemishes only come through evil speech. And our rabbis say, ‘You should know that blemishes come from evil speech; behold, Miriam the righteous – through her speaking evil speech about Moshe, her brother, did blemishes approach her.

Our rabbis taught us: If he can answer without being distracted, he may answer. Why? Because nothing is greater before the Holy One, blessed be He, more than the \"Amen\" that the Jews answer. Rabbi Yehudah bar Simon: This \"Amen\" has three intentions. Oath, acceptance, faithfulness. How do we know \"oath\"?

Honey and milk, as it says: \"Honey and milk under your tongue\" (Songs 4:11). Oil, form where? \" Your name is like finest oil\" (Songs 1:3).

Another interpretation: just as oil lives forever (never spoils) so too the words of Torah never spoil. Just as oil gives light to the world so too the words of Torah give light to the world. Another interpretation: just as oil does not mix with other liquids, so too Israel cannot mix with idolaters. From where do we get this? Because it is written \"I have separated you from the [other] peoples to be mine!\" (Lev. 20:26). Another interpretation: Just as oil, even if you put it in many different liquids, it comes on top, so too Israel are higher than the idolaters, just as it is written \"\" (Deut. 28:1).

Another interpretation: Rabbi Yehoshua says, in the name of Rabbi Nachman - everyone who comes to the synagogue and listens to words of Torah will merit to sit among sages in the world to come, as it is written \"A ear that listens the directions of life will dwell among sages\" (Prov. 15:31)."

What is he required to do? So taught the sages: The morning prayer is til midday, the afternoon prayer til nightfall, evening prayer has no fixed [time]. But for the Musaf [prayers], all day. Rabbi Elazar said: [If] he forgot and did not pray the Musaf prayer, and he came to pray the afternoon prayer, he should pray the afternoon prayer and afterward the Musaf prayer. Why? For everything was created for its time. The evening prayer has no fixed [time], until dawn. Why?

[To illustrate, when] Cain overtook his brother Abel and murdered him, a [divine] decree went out, (Genesis 4:12) 'You will be a restless wanderer (na v'nad) on earth.' Immediately, he stood and confessed before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it says, (Genesis 4:13) 'My punishment is more than one can bear.' He said before Him: Master of the World! You bear the whole world, yet my sin You cannot bear? You wrote, (Micah 7:18) 'Who bears sin and forgives the transgression,' forgiving the great sinner. Immediately, he found kindness before the Holy One, blessed be He, and He held back the \"restlessness\" (na), half the decree, and so it is written (Genesis 4:16) 'And he dwelled in the land of Nod [wandering, but not na, restlessness]. From here you learn that prayer is held great before the Holy One, blessed be He. And so for Hezekiah, when He told him, (II Kings 20:1) 'Put your house in order, because you are going to die...' immediately (II Kings 20:2) 'Hezekiah turned his face to the wall [and prayed to God]...' The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: (II Kings 20:5-6) 'I have heard your prayer... I have added 15 years for your life...'

This is what the sages taught: the one who begins and the one who ends say a blessing before and after the Torah (Mishnah Megillah 4:2). And from where do we know that [reading the Torah] needs a blessing before and after? As it is written \" Blessed are You, Ad-nai; train me in Your laws. \" (Psalms 119:12) - here is the blessing before. And from where do we know that [reading the Torah] needs a blessing after? Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: it is written after the song (Deuteronomy 33:1) \"and this is the blessing - [so too] one who taught Torah to them and afterwards blessed: here is the blessing afterwards. Another explanation: the Holy Blessed One said \"if you merited to bless the Torah, I too will bless you, as it is written \"in every place you call My name, I will come to you and bless you\" (Exodus 20:21). The rabbis said another explanation: the Holy Blessed One said: if you bless the Torah, you bless your own self. From where [do they know this?] \"For through me your days will increase, and years be added to your life\" (Proverbs 9:11). And if you say that I gave the Torah to you for your detriment, that is not true, I only gave Torah to you for your benefit since the ministering angels desired Torah and it was hidden from them, as it says, \"She has been hidden from the eyes of all living,\" (Job 28:21) these are the animals, \"and from the birds of the sky it has been hidden,\" these are the angels. How do we know this? As it says, \"One of the serafim (type of angel) flew to me,\" (Isaiah 6:6) God said to Israel: My children! From the ministering angels this thing is out of reach, but from you it is not. From where do we know this?

He is embarrassed, as it says: \"He does not open his mouth in the gate.\" The gate is Sanhedrin, as it is written: \"his brother’s widow shall appear before the elders in the gate\" Deuteronomy 25:7 (they are studying Levirite Marriage). Another Interpretation: The rabbis tell of a fool who walks into the synagogue and sees those that are involved in Torah [study].  He says to them: \"How does one learn Torah at first?\" They say to him: \"First you read Megillah (Esther), then the Torah, then the Prophets, then the Writings. When he completes the Written Torah, he studies the Talmud, then the laws, then the allegorical passages.\" When he hears this, he says in his heart, \"When am I going to learn all of this?\" and leaves the \"gate\" [i.e. the synagogue], as the verse says: \"He openeth not his mouth in the gate\". Rabbi Yannai said: This is comparable to a loaf suspended in the air. The fool says, \"who could bring it down [to earth]?\" The alert one says, \"No one took it?\" He gets a ladder or pole and brings it down. Similarly, all fools say, \"When will I read the entire Torah?\" Whereas the alert one, what does he do? - he studies one chapter each day, until he concludes the entire Torah. God says: \"It is not mysterious\", and if it is, it is \"from you\" [i.e. due to you]. This explains the verse (Deut 30:11) \"This commandment[...]\".",

Another possibility: What does, \"It is not in Heaven\" mean?  Shmuel said, The Torah was not commanded in astrological signs since belief in them is in the heavens.  They said to Shmuel, but hey, aren't you an astrologer and also great in Torah?  He said to them, I only look at the astrological signs when I am free from the Torah.  When is that?  When I enter the bathhouse.  Another possibility, \"It is not in Heaven.\"  They said to Moses our Teacher, but hey, you said to us, \"It's not in Heaven, it's not on the other side of the sea, but where is it?  he said to them, in the place that is close, in your mouths, and in your hearts to do it, it is not from from you, it is close to you all.  Another possibility, \"In your mouths and in your hearts to do it.\"  The Rabbis said, Shlomo said seven things about the lazy person, but what Moses said was greater than all of them.

He said to them, \"And the lion is outside.  They said to him, \"Inside the house, he replied to them and said, (what happens) if I am walking and find the door locked, I return and come?
