                "2": "It was said before Abraham was born. Nimrod was a heretic concerning the truth of the lord blessed be he.  He was conceited and he said that he himself was a God. And the people of his time served and bowed to him. He was so - an established king, and he was wise and he saw in the wisdom of the stars that there will be one man born in his time that will oppose him and deny him from his faith and he will be victorious over him. And he [Nimrod] trembled with a great fear. What did he do? He sent after his lesser officers and he told them this matter. He consulted them about what to do concerning this future child that will come. They advised him \"we agree on the following: that you will build a great palace and place guards in the opening and declare among your kingdom that every woman that they pass through and come there after ...[unknown]... if it's a son, you will slaughter him on her womb and if it's a daughter, it will live and you will give gifts to the mother and dress her in royal garments and they will call before her. Such will be done to a mother of a daughter. When Nimrod hear their advice, he was greatly gladdened much so. He declared in all the countries of his kingdom that there will come all the nations to build a great palace for the king 60 ama high, 80 ama long. After it was completed, he declared that all the women shall come and pass through the house and remain there until they gave birth. He commanded officials to bring them there. ...[unknown]... He decreed that the born son will be slaughtered on the chest of the mother and if a daughter, the mother was dressed in clothing of fine linens and silks colorfully embroidered and she will go out from there and they will give her much honor. So commanded King Nimrod and they left the house with honor."

                "2": "\"I lost the three shepherds in one month\" (Zecharia 11:8); and thus, in one month, Aaron, Miriam, and Moses died. Miriam died on the 1st of the month of Nisan, and the well closed up; and in the second of Nissan, Aaron's sons died; On the first of Av, Aaron died, and the clouds of glory dissipated; On the seventh of Adar Moses our teacher, and God's servant, died. Even though they didn't all die in the same month, it's considered as if it were one month. Each had a gift that they gave to the Israelites. By the merit of Miriam, God gave the well, by the merit of Aaron, the clouds of glory, By the merit of Moses, the Mana. When Miriam died, the well closed so the Israelites could see that it was by her merit that God granted them the well. Moses and Aaron bewailed her internally, and the Israelites did so publicly. Moses didn't know about the Israelites mourning until after six hours, when the Israelites came to them and said: \"how long will you sit and mourn?\" He said to them \"should I not continue to mourn my sister who has died.\" \"They said to him: \"just as you mourn for one soul, all the more so mourn for all of us.\" He said to them: \"why\" They said to him \"because we do not have water to drink.\" He stood and went and saw that there was no water in the well, and he began to argue with them, he said:\"did I not say to you that I can't carry this people on my own, did I not appoint for you officers for the thousands, and officers for the hundreds, and the fifties, and the twenties, I gave you officials, and chiefs, and great elders, and they are to busy themselves with your problems.\" They said to him: \"Everything is on you, for you are the one who brought us out of Egypt and brought us to this terrible place, if you give us water, everything will be fine, but if you don't, then we will stone you.\" When Moses heard this, he fled from them and went into the tent of meeting. God said to him \"Moses what is going on?\" Moses said before the Master of the World: \"your children want to stone me, and were I not to have fled, I would have already been stoned to death.\" God said said: \"how long will will you speak ill of my children, was it not enough for you that I told you at Horeb, just a little more and they will stone you. Now go and pass before them and see whether they will actually stone you, and it is said the Torah: \"God said to Moses, pass before the people.\" Moses went first and his cohort after him, and Moses didn't know which rock God had intended to give to them for bringing out water. The Israelites found a rock that was dripping, and they stood upon it. When Moses saw them standing on it, he turned around and said to God \"how long will you put our lives at risk?\" He said to them, \"until I bring water out of the rock.\" The Israelites said: \"give us water so that we can drink!\" Moses responded to them \"How long will you continue to rebel? Does a creation rebel against its creator? As such, you are rebelling against God. Moses said:  \"God wants to give you water.\" The Israelites said: \"you are the prophet who shepherds us in the dessert and now you say you don't know which rock God intends you to bring water out of? Moses and Aaron gathered the people around a different rock, as it says in the Torah \"Moses and Aaron gathered the community at the face of the rock.\" Moses said to himself: \"If I command the rock to bring out water and it doesn't, I'll be embarrassed before the community, and they will say to me, 'Moses, where is your alleged wisdom.'\" At the very same moment Moses told the Israelites, \"you know that God can do miracles for you,  and you know that miracles are beyond me. For when the knowledge of man is divinely inspired, it is not his own knowledge or wisdom. Moses brought down his staff upon the back of the rock, and he did so himself, as he spoke to the israelites , as it says in the Torah \"from this rock, we will bring you water.\" The rock began to fill itself to bring out water, and when Moses saw it, he lifted his arm again and struck the rock, as it says in the Torah \"he hit the rock twice with his staff.\" This time though, blood came out, as it says in the Psalms, \"yes, he hit the rock and the waters flowed (Psalm 78:20).\"  It's a flow of blood, as we see from the laws of menstruation \"when a woman has a discharge of blood (Leviticus 15:25).\" Moses came and said to God \"the rock isn't bringing out water, only blood.\" God said to the rock: \"why are you only bringing out blood, and not water?\" The rock said \"Master of the Universe, why did Moses hit me?\" God then asked Moses, \"why did you hit the rock?\" Moses responded: \"In order to bring out water.\" God said: \"Did I tell you to hit the rock? Did I not tell you to speak to it with words?\" Moses responded: \"I did speak to it, but nothing came out!\" God responded \"did you not command all of Israel \"in justice you shall judge your people (Leviticus 19)? Thus, why didn't you judge the rock with justice? This is how I raised you in Egypt, as it says in scripture 'God fed him honey from the rock,  (Deuteronomy 32:13).' It befits you to lead, and thus  say to my children \"listen you rebels!\" Don't read \"rebels\" rather \"idiots\" shotim (also a hominem for drinkers). They are idiots, and you have your eyes open. A nation of idiots will not enter the land of Israel, as it says in the Torah \"you will not bring this community . . .\" Therefore God said to Moses, \"tell the rock to turn it's blood into water.\" It is thus written in scripture: \"who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flinty rock into a spring (Psalm 114:8).\" (Note this is a Psalm recited during Hallel on Rosh Chodesh, the beginning of the month). When they reached the beginning of the month, God said to Moses, \"your time has come to an end.\" Moses said before him, \"please God, let it not be soon.\" \"It is tomorrow\" responded God, thus Moses was distressed all day, for he didn't know when exactly his death would come. ...",
                "3": "Go now, and return to Aaron and tell him that the time has come for him to depart this world. It is also the time for all those who are at least 50 years old who you led for the duration of the Exodus. Get up, it is the time for the seventy elders, and those with the officials of Israel shall come with Eliezer and Aaron, and they shall gather at Moses's tent, and they asked about his welfare, and after that they will go to the Tent of Meeting. This is the order in which they should go: Moses in the middle, Aaron to his right, Eliezer to his left, and the Elders on either side, and all of Israel behind them, and then all of them should enter the Tent of Meeting. Aaron should sit to the right of Moses, who will sit at the head. Eliezer will be at his left and the officers behind them. And you will say to him: \"God decrees that Moses and Aaron will die.\" And God said to Moses: \"my servant Moses, in every part of my house you were faithful, you have been a great speaker, and but there is a great request that I must ask of you, and it's hard for me to ask. Moses asked: \"What's the request?\" God said: \"You need to gather your brother unto his people (bury your brother), for he will not enter the land that I have given to the Israelites, those who rebelled against my commandments at Merivah. Moses said: \"God, all is known and clear to you and your holy throne, for you are master of the world, and all of your creations that you created in this world, and by your hand they came to be, and by your hand you will do that which you will, but it is not apparent to me how you could ask me to tell my brother that he is going to die. My brother is greater than me, and how can I speak to him and tell him to go up to the mountain of Hor where he will die.\" God responded to Moses: \" do not tell him with words, rather take Aaron and Eliezer his son and bring them to the mountain of Hor, and there you will go up with them and speak to him softly and gently, but also in a way that he will understand what's going on. When the three of you are on the mountain, strip Aaron of his clothes, and dress Eliezer his son in them, and Aaron will be gathered unto his people, and die there. ",
                "4": "When Moses heard this, he was deeply troubled in his heart, and he didn't know what to do. He cried a great and mighty cry, until it was time was time to deliver the news to his brother Aaron that he would die. Moses was steadfast to act, and went with this brother Aaron to tell him of the matter. He went to the Tent of Meeting and found Aaron there. That very day, Moses taught the custom: sit and cry only until the crowing of the rooster. Moses called Elieer and said to him: \" go and get the elders and the officers, for God has told me of an important matter. They came and gathered at the tent of Aaron. Aaron stood and found Moses standing. Aaron said to Moses: \"my brother, why have you taught us this custom today?\" He said to him: God is revealing something that I must tell you.\" He said to him: \"Speak!\" He responded, \"not until we leave here.\" Moses stood and dressed Aaron with the eight vestiges of the priestly clothing within Aaron's tent. After that he left. Therefore it was added as a custom that day that one should sit and cry only until the crowing of the rooster.\" Aaron was placed in the along with Moses; to their right was Joshua, to their left, the elders. The officers were both here and there, and all of Israel was behind them. Because the Israelites saw Aaron with the same respect as Moses, they rejoiced a great rejoicing, and said that \"Aaron is ascending farther toward the spirit of God. Because they loved him, they all came out  after him, and when they arrived at the tent of meeting, Aaron requested to enter the tent, but Moses wouldn't let him. Moses said to him: \"Let's go outside of the camp, for that is the intended direction.\" Aaron said to him: \"tell me what did God say to you?\" Moses responded: \"I'll tell you once we get to the mountain.\" Moses commanded the people (just as he did at Sinai, and just as Abraham did his lads on the way to Moriyah) stay here until we return to you, me, Aaron and Eliezer will go up to the top of the mountain, we will hear the word of God, and then we will return. The three of them went up. Moses wanted to say something to Aaron, but didn't know how, and didn't know what to say. Moses finally said: \"Aaron my brother, what are the appointed things that that God has given you?\" He responded: \"These\" He said: \"What?\" Aaron said: \"God has given me the altar, the table, upon which sits the bread of welcoming.\" Moses responded: \"These are the things that God has appointed to your hand, but now, God has something that he is asking of you.\" \"What is it\" Aaron asked? \"God has given you a light,\" said Moses. Aaron asked: \"What are you talking about, god has given more more than just a single light, God has given me seven (the lights of the menorah), and they are currently lit in the Tent of Meeting. Moses gave Aaron the sense that he was talking in parable, and that the candle of which he was referring, was really Aaron's soul. As it says in scripture: \"the soul of man is the light of God (Proverbs 20:27).\" Moses saw that Aaron still didn't understand the parable. He said to him \"in truth, you are called simple,\" as it says in scripture: \"and of Levi it is said, your Urim and Tumim (being read here is your light and your simpleness) are for a man of your faith.\" Immediatly, the cave opened at its mouth. Moses said: \"Aaron my brother, enter the cave.\" Aaron responded \"ok,\" and Moses request to strip Aaron of his clothing. Is it possible that when he stripped his clothing, he died naked, and was buried naked? God forbid! Rather, every high priest wears eight of the priestly garments, but the lower priests wear four. Aaron wore, eight, and Eliezer wore four. Moses only took four of Moses's clothes from Aaron and gave them to Eliezer to make him the high priest. Aaron still remained with four vestiges of clothing. They said to Eliezer, wait here until we leave, and Aaron and Moses entered. They saw a made bed and a set table with a menorah lit, and the angels of God standing on either side. Aaron said to Moses: \" my brother, how long will you hide from me what God has told you? You know that For you know that although God speaks to you first, God's mouth testifies on my behalf. Even now he is setting out to meet you, and he will be happy to see you. Why do you conceal the matter which the Holy One entrusted to you?even if it is about my death, I will accept it with joy. Moses said to him: \"Since you mentioned the subject of death, I will confirm your suspicion, and say that it is a matter of death which he spoke to me. I was afraid, however, to inform you of it. Your death is not like that of anyone else, for the ministering angels have come to carry you away. Aaron said to him: \"My brother Moses, why didn't you tell me in the presence of my Maker, my wife, and my children?\" Moses answered: \" My brother, do you not know that it is forty years since you made the calf and that you deserved to be killed then, but I stood in prayer and supplication before God, and God saved you from death, as it is written: \"Moreover, God was angry enough with Aaron to have destroyed him; so I also interceded (Deuteronomy 9:20). Is my death then going to be like your death? For when you die, you will have me to bury you, but when I die, I will not have my brother to bury me. When you die, your sons inherit your station, but when I die others will inherit my honor.\" Thus he comforted him with his words. "

                    "4": "...\"Let not the rich person glorify themselves with their wealth (Yirm 9:22).\"  This [refers to] Korach the Levite, who had three hundred mules just to carry the load of the keys to his hidden storehouses.  His wealth was so much the more so, wondrous and vast.  Where did he get all this?  It was the money that Yosef had collected in Egypt [in return for distributing the stored grain during the seven years of famine], which had filled three towers.  Each tower was a hundred amot [about 180 feet] deep and a hundred amot wide.  As soon as Korach found one of these towers, he became proud of his wealth.  Another one was found by Antiochus, and the third is hidden for the World to Come.  The origin of Korach's dispute was a widow who had a single ewe.  When she came to shear it [for the first time], Aharon heard and took the wool.  She went to Korach and wept before him, telling him, \"This and this has Aharon done to me.\"  Korach came by Aharon and said to him, \"What have you done by this widow, to take her wool?\"  Aharon said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the premier-part of the shearing of your sheep you are to give him' (Dev 18:4).\"  So Korach took four silver [coins] and gave [them] to her.  The days [passed] and the ewe gave birth to its first-born.  Aharon heard and took the lamb.  She went and wept before Korach.  Korach said to Aharon, \"What is it for you and for this widow, to take the son of the ewe?\"  He said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'every firstling that is born in your flock and in your herd, the male-one, you are to hallow to ha-Shem your God' (Dev 15:19).\"  Korach went to him, full of anger.  When the widow saw this, she sent and slaughtered the ewe.  Aharon heard, and came and book the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach.  Korach said to him, \"What is it for you, by this widow?\"  He said to him, \"They are mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the priest is to be given the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach' (Dev 18:3).\"  When the widow saw this, she stood and specially-devoted the meat.  Aharon heard and took the meat.  Korach said to him, \"It wasn't enough, everything that you took from her?  Now even the meat?\"  He said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'everything specially-devoted in Israel -- it is for you' (Bam 18:14, Parshat Korach).\"  He [Korach] said to him [Moshe], \"Why have you, son of Amram, established authority over us, and been raised up over us?\"  Moshe said to him, \"Unto the morrow, judgement.\"  In the morning, Korach had gathered to him 250 men with [fire-]pans and smoking-incense.  Immediately Moshe stood before the Holy One of Blessing and said, \"Multiplier of Universes, is this prophecy you have sent me true?\"  Ha-Shem replied to him, \"It is true.  And now you will see what I will do to Korach, and why his name is called Korach.  For in his days, there will be made baldness in Israel.\"  Immediately the Holy One of Blessing instructed the ground and it swallowed them [Korach and his followers] up to their navels.  Korach cried out and said, \"Moshe!  Have mercy on us!\"  Moshe said to them, \"'Too much is yours, Sons of Levi!' (Bam 15:7).\"  Immediately they were swallowed up [by the earth], and the rest were burned up [by fire].  Those that were swallowed [by the earth] reasoned that they would never rise up [again].  Until Hannah came and prophesied for them, as it [the song of Hannah] says, 'ha-Shem brings death and gives life, lowers to Sheol and raises up (Shmuel I 2:6).'  But in all this they didn't believe, until the Beit ha-Mikdash destroyed.  [For the earth] swallowed the gates of the Beit ha-Mikdash, and they [the gates] came by Korach and he grabbed hold of them.  They [Korach and his followers] said, \"When these gates rise up, so too we will be brought up with them.\"  [ed. Jellinek: And they were appointed the guardians, or, those who carried out the observances, over the gates until they rise up.]  Therefore we say, 'Let not the rich person glorify themselves with their wealth,' for all wealth belongs to the Holy One of Blessing.  As it says, 'Mine is the silver and mine is the gold -- the word of ha-Shem, Master of Legions (Hag 2:8).  And it says, 'One who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor (Mish 21:21).'"

His wealth was so much the more so, wondrous and vast. Where did he get all this money? From the money that Yosef the Righteous had collected in Egypt [in return for distributing the stored grain during the seven years of famine], which had filled three towers. Each tower was a hundred amot [about 180 feet] deep, a hundred amot wide, and one hundred amot inside. Yosef gave them all to the house of Pharaoh, and did not give his children even five silver [coins]. For what reason? Because he proceeded faithfully, as it says (Ber 47:14), \"Yosef brought the silver into Pharaoh's house.\" When Korach found one of these towers, he became proud of his wealth. Another one was found by Antoninus, and the third is hidden for the World to Come.  What was the origin of Korach's dispute with Moshe and with Aharon? It was for the sake of a particular widow who had a single ewe. When she came to shear it [for the first time], Aharon heard and took the wool. She went to Korach and cried out and wept, telling him, \"This and this has Aharon done to me.\" Korach came by Aharon and said to him, \"What is it with you and this widow, that poor woman? Return to her her wool!\" Aharon said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the premier-part of the shearing of your sheep you are to give him' (Dev 18:4).\" What did Korach do? He took four silver [coins] and gave [them] to her. She went off, and Korach went full of anger. The days [passed] and the ewe gave birth to a [first-born] male. Aharon heard and took the lamb. She went before Korach, crying out and weeping.

When the widow saw this, she went and slaughtered the ewe. Aharon heard, and came and took the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach. Korach said to him, \"What is it with you and this widow?\" He said to him, \"They are mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the priest is to be given the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach' (Dev 18:3).\" And Korach went, full of anger. When the widow saw this, she stood and made an oath, saying the meat of this ewe is set-aside for me. Aharon heard and took all the meat, as it says, 'everything specially-devoted in Israel -- it is for you' (Bam 18:14, Parshat Korach).\"  He [Korach] said to him [Moshe], \"Why should you, son of Amram, establish authority over us?\" [not in ed. Jellinek: 'Should you pluck out the eyes of these men, we will not come up.' They said this verse specifically against Moshe and Aharon.] Moshe said to him, \"To the morrow, judgement.\" In the morning, Korach had gathered to him 250 men (and alongside Moshe and Aharon, all the prophets), these with their fire pans, these offering sacrifices and these burning incense. Immediately Moshe Rabbeinu stood in prayer before ha-Shem and said, \"Multiplier of Universes, is this prophecy you have sent us true?\" Ha-Shem replied to him, \"It is true. And you will see what I will do to Korach.\" This is why he was named Korach -- for in his days, 'a void was created in Israel' (Sanhedrin 109b).  Moshe said further before the Holy One of Blessing, \"If these die as all people do, if their lot be the common fate of all humanity, ha-Shem did not send me (Bam 16:29).\" The Holy One of Blessing said to Moshe, \"You have rejected a major principle of faith\" (Passover Haggadah, Maggid, Four Children; and Yer. Sanhedrin 10:1, 50a). Moshe said before the Holy One of Blessing, \"Multiplier of Universes, 'if ha-Shem creates a new creation...' (Bam 16:30). The Holy One of Blessing said to him, \"I will do according to your will.\"  Immediately the Holy One of Blessing hinted to the ground and it swallowed them [Korach and his followers] up to their navels. Korach and all his household cried out and said, \"Moshe! Moshe! Have mercy on us!\" Moshe said to them, \"'Too much is yours, Sons of Levi!' (Bam 16:7).\" Immediately they were swallowed up [by the earth], and the rest were burned up [by fire], as it says, 'so they went down, they and all theirs, alive, into Sheol; the earth covered them (Bam 16:33).' And it is written, 'fire went out from before the presence of ha-Shem and consumed the fifty and two hundred men, those who had brought-near the incense.'  Those that descended below the earth remained there. And they reasoned that they would never rise up [again]. Until Hannah came and prophesied for them, as it [the song of Hannah] says, 'ha-Shem brings death and gives life, lowers to Sheol and raises up' (Shmuel I 2:6). But with all this, they didn't believe that they would rise again, until the Beit ha-Mikdash was destroyed and the gates of the Beit ha-Mikdash were swallowed up, as it says, 'her gates have sunk into the ground' (Eichah 2:9). They [the gates] came by Korach and he grabbed hold of them. Immediately they believed and said, \"When these gates rise up, so too will we rise up with them.\" And they were appointed the guardians [or, those who carried out the observances] over those gates until they rise up.  Thus was Korach and his wealth obliterated from among the community. Therefore it says, 'Do not praise the wealthy for their wealth,' for all wealth belongs to the Holy One of Blessing. As it says, 'Mine is the silver and mine is the gold -- the word of ha-Shem, Master of Legions' (Hag 2:8). [ed. Jellinek: And it says, 'One who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor' (Mish 21:21).]  "

And after him came a second author who made a second alphabet, in the Holy Tongue, because he found some Talmudic and Midrashic content, and appended it to them in order to complete the alphabet.

                "0": "Another Alphabet of ben Sira",
                "1": "It is written, (Job 9:10) <i> \"Who performs great deeds which cannot be fathomed, And wondrous things without number.\" </i> Come and see how great are the Holy Blessed One's deeds! Since it says, <i> \"Who performs great deeds which cannot be fathomed,\" </i>  why does it also say <i> \"And wondrous things without number\"? </i>  And since it says <i> \"And wondrous things without number,\" </i> why does it also say <i> \"Who performs great deeds which cannot be fathomed\"? </i> How have the Sages interpreted it? <i> \"Who performs great deeds which cannot be fathomed,\" </i> refers to all the created beings in the world, <i> \"And wondrous things without number,\" </i> refers to the three beings who were born without their parents having mortal sex. And these are they: Ben Sira, Rav Papa, and Rabbi Zeira. (The \"Yuchasin\" brings the matter regarding Rabbi Judah the Pious's father, see further Tzemach David Part 1 1:448) They are all completely righteous ones, and wise, and great Torah scholars. And they said about Rabbi Zeria and Rav Papa that they never once spoke of worldly matters; and never slept in the Hall of Study, neither fully sleeping nor napping; and nobody ever showed up to the Hall of Study earlier than they did; and nobody ever found them sitting quietly instead of sitting and reciting Torah; and they never missed Kiddush; and they never gave their friends nasty nicknames; and never took honor from their friends' shame; and never even cursed their friends from their beds; and never looked at the image of an evil person; and didn't accept gifts; and these two both fulfill what is said: (Proverbs 8:22) <i> \"I endow those who love me with substance; I will fill their treasuries.\" </i> (The Talmud lists these qualities about other Sages, see further in Megillah 27b-28a.) And how did their mothers give birth without husbands? They said: Once they went to the bathhouse, and some seed from an Israelite entered their bellies, and they conceived and gave birth from this, without knowing who their fathers were. But Ben Sira's father was known to him! How did his mother give birth without a husband's intercourse? They said about her that she was the daughter of Yirmiyahu. Once, Yirmiyahu went to the bathhouse, and found there evildoers from the tribe of Ephraim, and he saw that they were all wasting their seed, because the whole tribe of Ephraim in that generation were evildoers, as it is written about them that they did what was wrong in God's eyes. And when he saw them, he began to rebuke them. Immediately, they rose up against him, and said, \"Why are you rebuking us? We swear by the road to Bethlehem that you will not leave here until you do what we are doing.\" He said to them, \"Leave me alone and I will swear to you that I will never reveal this situation.\" They said to him, \"Didn't Tzidkiyahu see Nevuchadnetzar eating a live rabbit, and swear to him in God's name that he would not reveal his secret, and then nullify that oath? (Nedarim 65b, Eicha Rabbah s.v.: \"they sit on the ground\") You will do the same thing! But now, if you do what we are doing, good, and not, we will do the Sodomite act to you, like our ancestors did for idolatrous purposes. If they did it for idolatry, how much more so should we do it to you!\" Immediately, he did it, out of great terror and fear of them. When he began leaving there, he started to curse his birthday, saying (Jeremiah 20:14) <i> \"Accursed be the day That I was born!\" </i> He left there, and fasted for this incident 248 fasts, parallel to all the organs of a man. And the drop that came from that righteous man was guarded until that righteous man's own daughter came to the bathhouse, and it entered her belly. At seven months, she gave birth to a son who had teeth and could speak, and once she gave birth, she developed shame around people, because they would say that she gave birth through promiscuity. The child opened his mouth and said to his mother, \"Why are you ashamed around people? I am the son of Sira.\" She said, \"Who is Sira?\" He said, \"Yirmiyahu, and the reason he is called Sira is because he is the officer (sar) over all officers, and because he will ultimately name all officers and kings, and when you calculate 'Sira' and 'Yirmiyahu' in numerical values, they are equal.\" She said to him, \"My son, if this is true, you should have said, 'I am the son of Yirmiyahu.'\" He said to her, \"I would have wanted to say that, but it is a shameful thing, saying that Yirmiyahu has had sex with his daughter.\" She said to him, \"My son, is it not written (Ecclesiastes 1:9) <i> \"Only that shall happen Which has happened,\" </i> and who has ever seen a daughter have a child by her father?\" He said to her, \"My mother, (Ecclesiastes 1:9) <i> 'There is nothing new Beneath the sun!' </i> Just as Lot was a completely righteous man, my father is also a completely righteous man. Just like Lot did it under compulsion, my father also had this done under compulsion.\" She said to him, \"I am stunned by you. How do you know these things?\" He said to her, \"Do not be stunned by me, because there is nothing new beneath the sun. The same thing occurred with my father Yirmiyahu when his mother was kneeling to give birth- he opened his mouth, and my father called from his mother's innards, and said, 'I will not leave until you tell me my name.' His father opened his mouth and said, 'Come out, and your name will be Avraham' and he said, 'That is not my name.' He said, 'Come out, and your name will be Yitzchak...' and then Yaakov and all the tribes, and all the men of that generation, and he kept saying, 'That is not my name.' Until Eliyahu of Blessed Memory arrived there, and said, 'Your name will be Yirmiyah, because in your days the Holy Blessed One will establish an enemy to raise (yarim) his hand against Jerusalem.' He said, 'That is my name. And you, who told me my name, let your name be my name- let me have \"yahu\" from your name, and call me Yirmi-yahu.' Just as he was emerged speaking, I also emerged speaking; just as he emerged with prophecy from his mother's innards, as it is said, (Jeremiah 1:5) <i> 'Before I created you in the womb, I selected you' </i>; just as he wrote an alphabetical acrostic book (Eicha), I also will write an alphabetical acrostic book, so not do not but stunned by my speech.\" She said, \"My son, do not say it, so the Evil Eye will not reign over you!\" He said to her, \"The Evil Eye has no permission to reign over me, so now do not keep talking to me, for I am going to do what my father did. It is about me that it is said, (Ketubot 63a) 'One ewe follows another,' and a son follows his father's deeds.\" She said to him, \"My son, why are you stopping me from talking?\" He said, \"Because you know that I am hungry, and you do not let me eat anything.\" She said to him, \"Here are breasts for you- eat your food and drink your drink.\" He said to her, \"I have no interest in your breasts. Rather, go and sift through flour like a hen, knead fine bread and fatty meat, and old wine, and you must eat together with me.\" She said to him, \"But how could I buy things like this?\" He said to her, \"Make clothes and sell them, and the verse will be upheld for you: (Proverbs 31:24) <i> 'She makes cloth and sells it.' </i> and if you support me, the verse (Proverbs 31:29), 'Many women have done well, But you surpass them all' will be true.\" She began to make clothes and sell them, and she would bring him bread and fatty meat, and old wine, and she supported him for one year. And after that year, he said to her, \"Bring me to the synagogue,\" so she brought him to the house of one educator who had seven daughters. He sat beside him, and said to him, \"Rabbi, teach me Torah!\" He said to him, \"You are not yet eligible to study, because you are so small, and our Sages z\"l said (Pirkei Avot 5:21): 'A child of five should study Written Torah.'\" Ben Sira said to him, \"And have you not learned that (Pirkei Avot 2:15) 'the day is short, and the work is plentiful'? And you are telling me 'Sit and do not learn yet because you are so small,' while I see in the cemetery those smaller than me who have died, and who knows what will be, whether I will live or I will die?\" The educator said to him, \"What, are you my teacher? Haven't our Sages z\"l said: \"Anyone who teaches halacha in front of their Rabbi is liable for the death penalty'?\" He said to him, \"So far, you are not my Rabbi and so far, I have learned nothing from you.\" The educator said to Ben Sira, \"Say, 'Aleph.'\" He responded to him, saying:",

                "7": "ה) <b> \"Blind your eyes because of the graceful woman, lest you be caught in her trap.\" </b> The educator said to him, \"My son, what trap could I be caught in? If it is because of some magic you could do for me, I know that you will never do magic for me! Because her first husband is a thin-bearded man, (see Sanhedrin 100b and Rashi there) and I am a thick-bearded man.\" He said to him, \"Say 'Vav.'\" He said to him:",
                "8": "ו) <b> \"Woe to one who follows after his eyes! And know that they are the product of straying, and there is nothing to them.\" </b> He said to him, \"Say 'Zayin.'\" He said to him:",
                "9": "ז) <b> \"Do not be thin-bearded or thick-bearded. Scorn these things, because you do not know what has been decreed about you.\" </b> He said to him, \"I do not want to take your advice, because I am considering marrying her. And I have seven daughters, and she has one, and they will live in my house and provide for me with dignity.\" He said, \"Say, 'Chet.'\" He said to him: ",
                "10": "<b> \"Males are dear to all, but woe to fathers of females.\" </b> He said to him, \"But I have seven daughters, and they spin yarn and do all the chores of my household, and they are like a green olive tree or a beautiful garden in my house. So how could you tell me 'Woe to fathers of females?' And if there were no females, where would the males come from?\" Ben Sira said to him, \"Oh, poor one! You comfort yourself with empty comfort. For this is how our Sages z\"l said it: (Pesachim 65a) 'Fortunate is the one whose children are male, and woe to the father of females.' This is why I said it to you. And furthermore, when a daughter is coming out of her mother's belly to the air of the world, the heavens and earth and stars and constellations and everything created in the world grieves over her, but when a son is coming out of his mother's belly to the air of the world, the whole world is happy. And if a person has a daughter and you ask, 'What did So-and-So's wife give birth to?' he answers with a weak voice, somber expression, eyes downcast, 'She gave birth to a daughter.' But if it is male, he answers you with sparkle, 'She gave birth to a son,' in a pleasant voice, with the best expression, and eyes looking upward.\"  He said to him, \"Say 'Tet.'\" He said to him: ",
                "11": "ט) <b> A daughter is a false image to her father. Out of fear of her, does not sleep at night.\" </b> He said, \"Say, 'Yud.'\" He said to him: ",

For he said to him, \"Say, 'Aleph'\" and he said, (Lamentations 1:1) <i> \"Alas! Lonely sits the city...\" </i> And he said to him, \"Say, 'Bet'\" and he said, (Lamentations 1:2) <i> \"Bitterly she weeps in the night...\" </i> And so on for every alphabetical acrostic that is in the scroll of Lamentations. Additionally, they said about Ben Sira that he learned the book of Leviticus in one day, and the educator said to him, \"The natural orders of Creation have been changed for you.\" Ben Sira said to him, \"There is nothing new under the sun, as behold Yirmiyahu learned it [this way], and it is written, (II Samuel 23:20) <i> \"Benaiah son of Jehoiada, son of a 'living' man,\" </i> where 'living' (\"chai\") is written but we read it 'valorous' (\"chayil\"). Could it be that the whole world is dead, and [only] he is living? Instead- he must have been 'living' through Torah, when he studied the book of Leviticus in one day.\" ",

The second year, he learned the Mikrah and the Mishnah, and the Talmud, both laws and narratives. The third year, he learned the Biblical and scribal grammatical traditions. The fourth year, he learned tools of logical inference, calculating equinoxes, and geometry. The fifth year, he learned the language of palm trees, the language of the ministering angels, the language of demons, and the Fox Fables. The sixth year, he learned the Sifra, and Sifrei, and Tanna De-Bei Eliyahu. The seventh year, he did not leave anything -large or small - without study. ",
                "28": "<b> Come and see how wise Ben Sira was! </b> They would bring him a se'ah [2-ish gallons] of wheat, and he would say to them, \"Count the wheat grains in this se'ah, and you will find in it such-and-such number of grains in sum,\" until his reputation had spread around the whole world. Eventually, Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon heard of his wisdom. And who did he hear it from? From his wise ones. And when his wise ones heard of his [Ben Sira's] wisdom, they said, \"Oy for us, Voy for us- because now Nebuchadnezzar will get rid of us. Instead, let us slander him to the king. He should send after him, and we will ask him something difficult, from our own logic that is not his logic, and if he does not respond do us with an answer, we will kill him.\" And this they did- they told the king and he sent for him, and he said to them, \"And what do you want to ask him?\" They said to him, \"What is 'Oy Vanehi.' If he knows, very well, and if not, we will kill him.\" A thousand cavalry went after him, all of whom had cut off a finger and uprooted a tree. They all said, as one, to the King, \"Our master, if you want to deploy us to anywhere in the world, we will go. But do not send us to one of the Israelite Sages, so that he does not do us what Elisha did to the Aramean troops. He wrote to them: (Jeremiah 27:6) (Shabbat 129b (150a?)) <i> '\"I even give him [Nebuchadnezzar] the wild beasts of the field to serve him.\" </i> As he tells you, you must go. They said to him(?): \"This is a sign that his God has entrusted me, and he should come with you,\" and he wrote it for them in a letter. When they arrived to him and showed him the letter, Ben Sira said to them, \"He sent you not for me but for one rabbit that I have.\" Immediately, he took a rabbit and wrote on its head, \"Behold, this is of the wild beasts of the field and will serve you.\" He [Nebuchadnezzar] said, \"How is it that this hair is shaved off like vellum?\" He said, \"It is not by iron or any other thing.\" \"I see its flesh inside it, and vellum cannot possibly have its flesh inside it.\" And he did not know how it was constructed. Immediately, he sent after him another delegation, and sent him in writing, \"If you do not want to come in my honor, come in the honor of your rabbit.\" Immediately, he [Ben Sira] softened  and became willing to do it, and went to him. And at the point when he arrived to him, he was seven years old. Immediately all Nebuchadnezzar's wise ones gathered around him and began questioning him. They said to him, \"What is Oy Vanehi?\" He said to them, \"When you heard about me, you had an 'Oy,' and if I kill you, you would have a 'Nehi.'\" They said to him, \"Explain it well for us, what is \"Nehi' and what is 'Vay?\" He said, \"There are two vavs in it, and their meaning is: When someone goes and touches a dog, and grabs its ear- that is certainly 'Vay' for him. And even before being saved from a snake, if a lion comes to him - that is certainly 'Oy Vanehi.'\" When they heard this, they were afraid, and they passed around the words, and said, \"We do not know what you are saying. Show us 'Voy Vanehi' to our own eyes.\" Immediately, he went and took a container (a hollow tube) with two openings and went and caught three snakes and three scorpions, and placed the scorpions in the lower opening and the snakes in the upper opening, and sealed the container and came before the king. And his wise ones said, \"What is in the container?\" He said to them, \"Look!\" Immediately one of them put his hand in the container in the first opening and felt the snakes, and said, \"Vay, what is this?!\" One put his hand in the lower opening and a scorpion struck him, and he said, \"Vay Vanehi!\" Ben Sira said to them, \"Behold- you know 'Vay Vanehi' and you have seen them.\" When they saw that it was so, they immediately were afraid and sweated and trembled, and fell on their faces. The king said to them, \"You contracted with me that if he did not know 'Vay Vanhei' you would kill him; behold, he knows 'Vay Vanehi.' The judgment that you ruled for him, that he should be executed- now you are liable for that execution.\" They said to him, \"Let the king do whatever he wants to his servants.\" Immediately he handed them over to Ben Sira. He said to them, \"Haven't you brought me here here for 'Vay Vanehi?'\" Immediately he took them and threw them into the lion's den and they died, at the words 'Vay Vanehi.' Then the king lifted Ben Sira and placed him on a golden throne and set a crown on his head. The king said to him, \"I will king you, since you are suitable to rule.\" He said to him, \"My master, I do not want it, since I am small. And it would not be suitable for me to rule over Israel, since I am not from the dynasty of David.\" He said to him, \"But Yoash assumed the throne when he was seven years old.\" He said to him, \"He was from the royal dynasty.\" He said to him, \"Since you do not want it, sit with me in my kingship, since I want to ask you about any matters that I have in my heart, that I see in the world and do not know.\" He said to him, \"My master, anything that you want, ask, and I will explain to you anything that you say.\" Then he asked him twenty-two questions (the number of the alphabet) and he responded to (and answered) his questions, and here they are: ",
                "29": "<b> א </b> First he asked him, \"How does the rabbit shave her head?\" He said to him, \"With a serum of quicklime.\" He said to him, \"What is it like?\" He said to him, \"The shaver shaves the hair.\" He said to him, \"And what is it called?\" He said to him, \"A serum of quicklime, which is quicklime and 'zernich' (arsenic), and this material, in the days of your mother, was created by Solomon from his mind, in his wisdom. When your mother, the Queen of Sheba, came to Solomon and brought him a gift to see his wisdom, she appealed to him, and he wanted to sleep with her, and he found her entirely hairy, and he brought her quicklime and arsenic, and crumbled it with a chopper by way of (the soles of) the feet, and crushed the arsenic, and mixed them in water, and it turned into the quicklime serum for shaving, and he applied it to her, and rinsed her, and her hair detached, and at that point he had sex with her.\" He said to him, \"I would not believe these things unless I saw them with my own eyes.\" He said to him, \"How do you know this?\" He said to him, \"I am a prophet and the Holy Blessed One reveals all sealed matters to me.\" He said to him, \"If so, then what you have told me is true.\" ",

Ten of them are eaten as-is, and here they are: apples, figs, shekamim, citrons, grapes, quinces, pears, botnim, peppers, and limonia, which is the Ishmaelite language and is prepared salted. And for ten of them the inside is eaten and the outside is discarded, and here they are: pomegranates, walnuts, almonds, pistachios, sanduvin, morlin, katpilin [kalpilin], gonzarin, krumin. And their names in the Arab language are goz, luz, fistuk, banduk, sahablot, doman, tznobar, blot [...] For ten of them, what is on the outside is eaten, and here they are: dates, olives, carobs, persimmons, crabapples, plums, achonyot, gadgadniyot, charutim, alusim.\" He said to him, \"And who planted them?\" He said to him, \"The first Adam took them from the Garden of Eden, and even before he left, he took them from there, with the permission of the Holy Blessed One.

Or have you been told?\" He said to him, \"If you want, cover my eyes and go out with your soldiers, and form them into separate troops for yourself, and I will tell you which troop you are in.\" And he did so- he covered his eyes and placed a trusted man with him. A troop passed by with noise and shouts, until the earth was shaking. The trusted one who was with him said to him, \"Is the king among this troop?\" He said to him, \"No.\" (In the Talmud, this is told about Rav Sheshet, Berachot 55a) Another troop passed by with great shouting, and it had cavalry running along all the sides. The trusted man said, \"Is the king among this troop? He said to him, \"No.\" A third troop passed by with chants and all kinds of music. He said to him, \"Is there a king here?\" He said to him, \"No.\" A fourth troop passed by in silence, and even the sound of the horses' hooves could not be heard, but rather a thin stillness. He said to him, \"Is it here?\" He said to him, \"Yes. [And behold he is right across from me!\" Immediately they opened his eyes and he saw him standing by him.] The king said to him, \"Inform me how you knew this great secret.\" He said to him, \"You are so haughty in your royalty that you compare yourself to the Holy Blessed One, as it is said, 'And behold, God passed by with a thin, still sound,' in which the King, King of Kings, was visible seated on a high and lofty throne.\" He said to him, \"You equate me with your God!\" He said to him, \"You are not equal to Them, but because of your pride and great wickedness, you have become comparable to the Holy Blessed One's authority, and that is why Their anger is against you.\" He said to him, \"And if Their anger is against me, how could They have lifted me up, and made me great in the world, and handed everything over to me?\" He said to him, \"When the Holy Blessed One wants to bring a person low, They first raise them and then lower them, as it says, (Ovadiah 1:4) <i>'If you go as high as an eagle...'\" </i> Immediately, he said to him, \"If you become my son-in-law and marry my daughter, I will appoint you king in my place.\" He said to him, \"I am a human being, and I cannot marry an animal, as it says, 'Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys...'\" When the king heard that he was cursing, insulting and slandering the nations of the world, he got very angry. He said to his wise ones, \"Tell me something that we can feed him secretly so that he will die.\" They said to him, \"We do not know.\" Immediately, he killed them, and said to Ben Sira: ",

I have a friend and I hate him and want to kill him using something he doesn't know about, with a food that they can feed him so he dies.\" Immediately, Ben Sira understood that he intended to kill him, so he said to him, \"Let me compare it to a fable for you. There was once an unendingly beautiful horse belonging to Nimrod. The other horses said to him, 'Give us your head to cut off, and we will give you a house full of straw and barley.' The horse knew what they were trying to do to him, for he was intelligent. He said to them, 'Fools! If I give you my head to cut off, who will eat the straw and barley?' Thus you are seeking to kill me, but if you kill me, who will take one r'em of silver and god, and who will eat them?\" He said to him, \"By Kemosh's life, I will not kill you.\" He said to him, \"I will tell you.\" He said to him, \"Give him ten days and have him eat egg yolks without salt, and he will die.\" The king thought to himself, \"He lies.\" He brought someone and fed it to him, and he died. The king said to him, \"Eat it before me, and I will leave you alone.\" He said to him, \"Everything that you prepare with your hands I cannot eat. I will prepare it and eat them.\" What did he do? He added salt secretly, and he ate it for a full month. He said to him, \"Why did you lie to me?\" He said to him, \"I made them thin, crushed them a little, and put something in them.\" Immediately, the king went and did this, and became ill. He said to him, \"Heal me!\" He wrote him an amulet, and he was healed. He said to him, \"Why did you try to kill me?\" He said to him, \"Thus goes the ancient fable- evil comes from evil people. Act first to kill someone who is trying to kill you.\" ( <i> Someone trying to kill you- kill them early </i> ) Immediately, his small son became ill. The king said to him, \"Heal my son, and if you do not, I will kill you.\" Immediately he sat and wrote him an amulet in the Name quickly, and wrote the names of the angels who are appointed for healing, with their names, and their composition, and their form, and their wings, and their arms, and their legs.

Immediately they began to challenge each other. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the Earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the world's air. Adam stood in prayer before his Creator and said, 'Sovereign of the universe! The woman you gave me has run away from me.' Immediately, the Holy Blessed One sent these three angels to bring her back. The Holy Blessed One said to Adam, 'If she agrees to come back, good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.' They departed and pursued her, and overtook her in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians would ultimately drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, 'We shall drown you in the sea.' She said to them, 'Let me be. I was created only to cause illness to infants. I have dominion over them for eight days after birth if they are male, and if female, after birth for twenty days.' When the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted on taking her. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God, 'Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write their names on the amulets of young children, and she sees them, she remembers her oath, and the child is healed.\" After some time, the king said to him, \"I have one daughter who sneezes [note- a euphemism for passing gas] one thousand sneezes in an hour. Heal her.\" He said to him, \"Send her to me in the morning with her guards and I will heal her.\" In the morning, she came to him with her guards. When he saw her, he began to get angry. She said to him, \"Why did you get angry?\" He said to her, \"Your father has decreed upon me to sneeze a thousand sneezes before him tomorrow and in two days, and I am afraid that he will kill me. He has waited for me for three days, and I do not know what I will do.\" She said to him, \"Do not worry about this- I will go in your place and I will sneeze before him a thousand sneezes for you and for myself.\" He said to her, \"Since that is the case, stay with me for three days and do not sneeze during them, and be 'prepared for the third day.' Immediately, every time when the sneeze came to her, she would stand on her feet and stretch between her eyes, as he had told her, and she suffered with herself and closed her mouth little by little, and the sneeze ended from her entirely. After three days, no sneeze came from her mouth. On the third day, he took her to her father and said to her, \"Go sneeze two thousand sneezes for your father.\" She went before him, and she could not sneeze even one time. Immediately, he stood up and kissed him. He began asking him questions. He said to him:",

David said before the Holy Blessed One: 'Master of the world! What benefit is there to these, which you created in your world? The wasp eats honey and stings, and she gets no benefit from it; the spider weaves all year but he never dresses in it; the fool with no intelligence harms other creatures and does not know your unity and strength, and there is no benefit in him to the world.' The Holy Blessed One said to him: 'David! You are slandering the creatures. The hour will come when you will need them, and you will know why they were created.' And when he hid in a cave because of King Saul, the Holy Blessed One sent a spider, and she wove a web over the mouth of the cave and sealed it. Saul came and saw it woven. He said, 'Certainly nobody has entered here, for anyone entering would have torn the webbing to shreds.' He continued and did not enter there. And when David exited and saw the spider, he kissed her and said to her, 'Blessed is your Creator and blessed are you! Master of the world, who can compare to your workings and strength? For all you make is good.' And before Achish, he made himself out to be a fool before his men, and Achish's daughter was an insane fool, so when they brought him [David] to him, he [Achish] said to them, 'Are you mocking me? Is it because of my daughter who is a fool that you brought this to me? Or maybe I do not already have enough fools?' Immediately, they released him, and he escaped and gave thanks to God for his deeds, for everything that he created in the world has benefit in it. And when David found Saul lying down at noontime, Avner was lying at the entrance, with his head at one entrance and his legs outstretched, and he [David] came and entered between his legs and took the water flask. And when he went to leave between his legs, Avner stretched his legs and covered him with them, and they were over him like two great pillars. And he asked for mercy from Hashem, and said, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' At that moment, a miracle was done for him, and sent him a hornet, and she bit Avner's legs, and he straightened them, and David exited and praised the Holy Blessed One.

They said to him, 'Oh, impure vermin! Haven't you learned a lesson from the sun and moon, which were equal in stature and appearance, but because the moon slandered the sun I reduced the luminaries and added onto the sun? Thus you too have slandered your friend to feed you, therefore he will eat you.' He said to Them, 'Ruler of the world! If this is the case, then I and my offspring will be destroyed!' They said to him, 'I will allow a remnant of you to remain, as I did for the moon.'

You, go to First Adam and live with him in his house, and eat and be satisfied, and I will go to the creeping, crawling animals, and though nothing is found, we will eat and we will live.' The cat said to the dog, 'Let us both swear not to go to the same master.' He said to him, 'You have said well.' Immediately they both swore, and the cat went to the house of the First Adam and found mice and ate and was satisfied, and the remaining ones fled from him. When he saw this, Adam said, 'The Holy Blessed One has sent me a great healing!' Immediately he settled him in his house and fed him bread and gave him water. Then what did the dog do? He went to the wolf. He said to him, 'Can I come to you tonight and sleep over?' He said to him, 'Yes.' They both went into a cave and lay down. The dog heard the sound of loud animal footsteps. Immediately he woke the wolf and said to him, 'I hear the sound of bandits!' He said to him, 'You go out and chase them away.' They stood up against him as if to kill him. He ran away and went to the monkey, and he chased him away. He went to the sheep, and he accepted him and lay down with him. He heard the sound of footsteps. The dog said to the sheep, 'I hear the sound of bandits!' He said to him, 'You go out.' The dog went out and started barking. The wolves said, 'The sheep went there,' and they went and found him [the sheep] and ate him, and the dog ran away from lodging to lodging and could not find any rest at all. Immediately, he went to First Adam, who accepted him and lay down to lodge with him. At midnight, the dog said to Adam, 'I hear footsteps!' Immediately, Adam stood up and took up the spear and went with the dog, and they chased the animals until they had made them run away, and the two of them returned together. Adam said to the dog, 'Come with me to my home, and live with me and eat my food and drink my water.' So he went with him. When the cat heard the dog's voice, he came out to greet him. He said to him, 'Why have you come to me?' He said to him, 'Adam brought me.' They began to quarrel. Adam said to the cat, 'Why are you fighting with him? I brought him, because I saw that he is he is entirely loyal.' He [Adam] said to him [the cat], 'Do not worry! You will be with me as has been your habit.' He said to him, 'My master, he is a thief. Is it nice to live with a thief?' The cat said to the dog, 'Why did you break your oath?' He said to him, 'I will not come into your residence, I will not eat what you have, I will not harm you at all.' He would not listen to him, so they began to quarrel. When the dog saw that it was so, he immediately ran to Seth's house and lived with him. The dog would try to make peace with the cat, but the cat was not amenable, and from that moment until this day they are in a quarrel.

One Sage came and said to the disagreeing Sages, 'I will uphold your words.' He said, 'In the ark, when Noah wanted to send him to see whether the waters had receded, he got himself away from Noah and went under the eagle's wing, so that Noah would not send him.

I have a legal case against you!\" He said to him, \"Because you are promiscuous and a fool and you project suspicion on the worthy.\" He [Noah] said to him, \"Wicked one!

Immediately he did this, and was throwing into the sea some pairs from all the species and drowning them in the sea. When the fox saw this, what did he do? Immediately he stood and was crying. The Angel of Death said, 'Why are you crying?' He said to him, 'For my friends, who you threw into the sea.' He said to him, 'And where are your friends?' Immediately the fox stood on the seashore and the Angel of Death saw the fox's shadow in the sea and thought that he had thrown in a pair other than him. He said to him, 'Get away from here.' Immediately the fox ran away and escaped. The weasel ran into him, and he told him what he had done. The weasel went and did it too, and escaped. After a year, Leviathan gathered up all the creatures in the sea, and the fox and the weasel were missing, for they had not entered the sea. He sent for them, and they told him what the fox had done, and that he and the weasel had escaped through their wisdom, and they said to him they he was extremely wise. And when Leviathan heard about him that he was intelligent, he was jealous of him and sent after him big fish and commanded them to steal his intelligence and bring it to him. They went and found him strolling along the seashore. When the fox saw that the fish were playing on the seashore, he was astounded and entered among them. When they saw him, they asked him, 'Who are you?' He said to them, 'I am a fox.' They said to him, 'Do you know that a great honor is coming to you, and that we have come for you?' He said to them, 'What is it?' They said to him, 'Leviathan is sick, and leaning towards death. He has commanded that nobody but the fox should rule in his place, because he has heard that you are wiser and more understanding than all other creatures. So come with us, for we are messengers and have come for your honor.' He said to them, 'But how could I enter the sea and not die?'

When he heard their words, he believed them, and he rode on one of them, and they steered him in the sea. When the waves came over him, he began to get uncomfortable. His mind left him and he said, 'Oy, what have I done? The fish have pranked me in return for all the pranks that I pranks that I played on the creatures, and now I have fallen into their hands, and how can I be saved from their hands?' He said to them, 'Now that I have come with you and I am in your possession, tell me the truth. Why do you want me?' They said to him, 'We will tell you the truth. Leviathan heard your reputation, that you are the wisest, and he said, \"I will tear his belly and eat his heart and I will become wise.\"' He said to them, 'And why did you not tell you the truth? I would have brought my heart with me, and I would have given it to King Leviathan and he would have honored me. But now you are going wrongly.' They said to him, 'Your heart is not with you?' He said to them, 'No, for our custom is such that we leave our hearts in our residences while we travel here and there. If we need it we bring but if not, it remains in our residence.' They said to him, 'So now what will we do?' He said to them, 'My residence, my lodging, is on the seashore. If you want, bring me back to the place where you took me from, and I will get my heart and I will come with you and I will give it to Leviathan, so he will honor me and he will honor you too. But if you bring me like this, with no heart, he will be angry with you and he will eat you. For myself, I am not afraid, because I can tell him, \"My master, they did not tell me ahead of time, and when they did tell me about you I told them to go back with me so I could get my heart, but they did not want to.\"' Immediately, the fish said, 'He is speaking well.' So they returned to the place from where they had taken him, to the seashore, and he descended off from the fish, and he started dancing and throwing himself onto the sand and laughing. They said to him, 'Quickly, get your heart and we will go!' He said to them, 'Go away, fools! If my heart was not with me, I would not have entered the sea with you! Unless you know of any creature who can walk while their heart is not with them?' They said to him, 'You have pranked us.' He said to them, 'Oh, fools. I pranked the angel of death, how much more so you!' Immediately, they returned embarrassed, and told him [Leviathan] this. He said to them, 'Truly, he is clever and you are simpletons, and about you it is said: (Proverbs 1:32) <i> \"For the tranquility of the simpleton will kill him.\" </i> And he ate them.

The angel of death's blade was in his hand too, and he had it his hand for seven years until the Holy Blessed One said to him, 'Yehoshua ben Levi, you have done a serious thing. Return the angel of death's blade.' And when he had jumped from before the angel of death and entered Gan Eden, the angel of death had shouted a great shout, and had wanted to destroy the world, but God had quieted him. And after seven years, he returned it (the blade) to him. Hiram, King of Tyre- the Holy Blessed One gave him entry to Gan Eden because he built the Temple. He was originally God-fearing, and was made to live in Gan Eden for a thousand years, but afterwards he became haughty and said, 'I am a god.' As it says: (Ezekiel 28:2) <i> \"Mortal man, say...\" </i> And therefore he was disturbed from Gan Eden and he entered Gehennom. The generation of Yonadav ben Rechav- because he wrote all the matters that are in the book of Jeremiah, and he was righteous and reproved Israel, and he lives in Gan Eden. And the generation of Malchas the Bird- when Chava ate from the Tree of Knowledge and gave to her husband too and he ate with her, she grew jealous of the other creatures and fed it to all of them. She saw Malchas the Bird and she said to him, 'Eat from this, which your friends have eaten from.' He said to her, 'Is it not enough for you that you have sinned to Blessed Hashem, and that you have caused others to die, that you are also coming to me to entice me to negate the command of the Holy Blessed One, so I will eat it and I will die? I am not listening to you.' And then he reproved Chava and all the creatures. A heavenly voice speedily called out and said to Chava and to Adam, 'You are commanded, but you did not observe, and you sinned, and you came to Malchas the Bird to make him sin too, and he did not accept that, and he feared Me, even though I had not commanded him, and he kept my decree. Therefore, eternally, he will not taste the flavor death, neither him nor his descendants.\" <b> כ\"ב </b> He said to him, \"And why does the eagle reach closer to the firmament than any other bird?\" He said to him, \"When they left the ark, the (female) eagle was standing with a bird in front of her, and she wanted to eat it. All the animals said, 'One who wants to eat his companion deserves the death penalty!' They hit her and shaved her wings and threw her into a lions' den. But after a year, her wings grew, and she flew away. The birds caught her and tried to kill her, but the raven used trickery to help her escape. He had sex with her and she became pregnant by him, and gave birth to an eagle, and that is why it is called an eagle [nesher]. And the raven is called raven ['orev] because he mixed ['irbev] his seed in all directions, due to the magnitude of his promiscuity. All the animals were searching for her, and a miracle was done and the Holy Blessed One manifested Their Shechinah over her so that his creation should not go extinct, and gave her the strength to fly above all the birds. Therefore it is called an eagle [nesher], because the Holy Blessed One manifested [hishrah] Their Shechinah over her. That is why she flies above, up to the firmament, so that her enemies will not catch her and kill her, extinguishing one type of the Holy Blessed One's creatures from the world.\" He said to him, \"Blessed is the One who distributes Their wisdom to those who fear Them, and has revealed secret, deep matters.\" ",

And since the Torah was beloved to them, they counted the days, the nights and the moments until the time would come. It can be compared to a man who will be receiving a desired object or marrying a woman at the end of fifty days; so due to his great desire, he counts the days and the moments. Likewise is Israel [with this]. And that is why they said (Menachot 66), 'It is a commandment to count days and it is a commandment to count weeks.'\" To here are [the words] of the midrash.

Rabbi Zeira opened [the discussion of Gehinnom with the verse]: \"The leech has two daughters, 'Give!' and 'Give!'\" (Proverbs 30:15). Said Rabbi Eliezer: Two walls of angels stand at the entrance of Gehinnom, and they say \"Give! Give! Bring! Bring!\" And why is its name Gehinnom? Because the sound of its groaning (from the Hebrew root NHM) goes from one end of the world to its other end. And why is its name Taphteh? Because all enter there through the temptation (from the Hebrew root PTH) of the evil inclination.",
                "3": "Chapter 1: Rabbi Yochanan opened: \"Those who pass through the valley of weeping (alluding to Gehinnom) turn it into a water spring; moreover, the early rain covers it with blessings.\" (Psalms 84:7). This teaches that the evil person confesses like the leper (who has to cover his upper lip) confesses, and says \"I am so-and-so, son of so-and-so. I committed such-and-such sin in such-and-such place on such-and-such day in front of so-and-so in such-and-such and such-and-such gathering. There are three gates (reading שערים as per mss.) in Gehinnom, one in the sea, one in the wilderness, and one in settled land. From where is the one in the sea? As it is said: \"From the belly of Sheol (another name for Gehinnom) I cried out, And You heard my voice.\" (Jonah 2:3). From where is the one in the wilderness? As it is said: \"They went down [with all that belonged to them] alive into Sheol...\" (Numbers 16:33). From where is the one in settled land? As it is said: \"Declares the LORD, who has a fire in Zion, Who has an oven in Jerusalem.\" (Isaiah 31:9). There are five types of fire in Gehinnom: Fire that eats and drinks, that drinks and doesn't eat, that eats and doesn't drink, that doesn't eat and doesn't drink, and there is fire that eats fire. There are burning coals the size of mountains in it, and there are burning coals the size of hills in it. There are burning coals the size of the Dead Sea in it, and there are burning coals the size of large stones in it. There are rivers of pitch and sulfur in it, dragging and boiling hot coals of broom-wood. The sentence of an evil person: Angels of destruction push him so that he falls on his face and others receive him from them and push him in front of the fire of Gehinnom, and it opens its mouth wide and swallows him, as it is said: \"Assuredly, Sheol has opened wide its gullet And parted its jaws in a measureless gape; And down into it shall go, That splendor and tumult, That din and revelry.\" (ibid. 5:14), to the one who doesn't have a single positive action that tilts him to the side of merit, but one who has in his hand Torah and good deeds and great afflictions come upon him is saved from the judgement of Gehinnom, as it is said: \"Though I walk through a valley of deepest darkness, I fear no harm... Your rod and Your staff—they comfort me.\" (Psalms 23:4). \"Your rod,\" those are the afflictions, \"and Your staff,\" that is the Torah.",
                "4": "Chapter 2: Rabbi Yochanan opened: \"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee, and their hope shall be the drooping of the soul.\" (Job 11:20), a body that isn't destroyed and its soul leaves in a fire that doesn't extinguish, and about them the scripture says: \"For their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.\" (Isaiah 66:24). Said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: One time, I walked on the road and I found Elijah the Prophet, his memory for blessing. He said to me: Is it your desire that I place you at the gate of Gehinnom? I said to him: Yes. He showed me humans that were hanging by their noses and humans that were hanging by their hands and humans that were hanging by their tongues and humans that were hanging by their legs, and he showed me women that were hanging by their chests, and he showed me humans that were hanging by their eyes, and he showed me humans to whom they were feeding their flesh and humans to whom they were feeding hot coals of broom-wood and humans sitting alive and worms were eating them. He said to me: These are the ones that about them it is written \"For their worm shall not die.\" (ibid.). And he showed me humans to whom they were feeding fine sand, and they were feeding them against their will and their teeth were breaking, and the Holy One Blessed Is He was saying to them: Evil ones, when you ate stolen [food], it was sweet in your mouths, and now there isn't within you the strength to eat, to fulfill that which is said: \"You break the teeth of the wicked.\" (Psalms 3:8). And he showed me humans whom they were casting from the fire to the snow and from the snow to the fire like this shepherd who shepherds his sheep from mountain to mountain, and about them the scripture says: \"Sheeplike they head for Sheol, with Death as their shepherd. The upright shall rule over them at daybreak, and their form shall waste away in Sheol till its nobility be gone.\" (ibid. 49:15). Said Rabbi Yochanan: Each individual angel is appointed to exact the punishment of one sin. This one comes and judges him and goes on his way, and so the second one and so the third one and so all of them until they recompense for all the sins that are in his hand. To what is the matter similar? To a debtor who had many creditors and they brought him before the king. Said to them the king: What should I do for you? Go and split it (his money) between yourselves. [So too] at that time, his soul is passed in Gehinnom to cruel angels and they split it between themselves.",
                "5": "Chapter 3: It is stated: Three go down to Gehinnom and don't go up: The one who has an affair with someone's wife and the one who whitens the face (embarrasses) of his friend in public and the one who swears falsely in the name of God, and some say even the one who is honored through the dishonor of his friend and the one who causes friction between a man and his wife to bring strife between them. On every Sabbath eve, they bring them to two snowy mountains and leave them there, and at the Sabbath's departure, they return them to their places, and an angel goes out and pushes them and returns them to their places in Gehinnom. And from them (the mountains) they take snow and put it beneath their underarms in order to cool them during the six weekdays, and the Holy One Blessed Is He says to them: Evil ones, Woe to you that even in Gehinnom you are stealing, as it is said: \"May drought and heat snatch away their snow waters, And Sheol, those who have sinned.\" (Job 24:19, read homiletically as they will snatch away snow waters), as if to say: even in Sheol they sinned.",
                "6": "Chapter 4: Every twelve months they (the evil ones) are made into ashes and the wind scatters them under the feet of the righteous, as it is written: \"And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet.\" (Malachi 3:21), and after that, their souls return into them and they go out from Gehinnom and their faces are black like the bottom of a pot and they affirm the righteousness of the judgement over them and say: You have sentenced us properly, You have judged us properly. Lord, righteousness is Yours, but we are shamefaced, as of this day. But the nations of the world, the worshipers of foreign worship, they judge them in seven pyres of fire and in every individual pyre [they are judged for] twelve months. And the River of Fire goes out from under the Throne of Glory and descends on them and goes from one end of the world to its other end. And there are seven pyres in Gehinnom (reading בגיהנם as per mss.)  (In the Midrash Rut HaNe'elam they detailed the seven pyres. See Zohar Chadash: 33, and see also Zohar: Terumah: 150b that there is a place in Gehinnom that is called boiling excrement ..., also in Midrash Tehillim 11:6), and in each individual pyre there are six thousand houses, and in each individual house there are six thousand windows, and in each individual window there are six thousand jugs of bitterness, and all of them are prepared for the scribes and for the judges that did not act reasonably, and concerning that time Solomon said: \"And in the end you roar, When your flesh and body are consumed...\" (Proverbs 5:11), and not one of them escapes, unless there is Torah and good deeds in him. After all of this, the Holy One Blessed Is He has mercy on His creations, as it is said: \"For I will not always contend, I will not be angry forever: Nay, I who make spirits flag, Also create the breath of life.\" (Isaiah 57:16).",

[It was] in order that there should not be honor and privacy in Israel, because any house that does not have a door has no honor or privacy. And any who wants to enter can enter whether day or night.) Since Israel saw this, they got up and removed all doors of their houses. They were unable to eat, drink or have relations, because of thieves, robbers, and Greek invaders. They did not sleep day or night. The verse was fulfilled upon them, \"You will be afraid night and day\" (Deuteronomy 28:66). They said before The Holy One Blessed is He (THOBH), Master of the world how much are we able to carry? He said to them, [This decree is] with the sin of Mezuzzah, but even so room was found in this decree. Israel was living without doors, and there is nothing that removes the evils of a wife from upon her husband like a door. As it says \"Go my people, come into your rooms etc.\" (Isaiah 26:20) They endured the decree for three years. When the Greeks saw that Israel endured the decree and no one violated it in any way, they stood up and decreed another decree. They spread a rumor: Any person from Israel who has an ox or sheep, he should inscribe on its horns that it has no portion in the God of Israel. (What was the reason for this [decree]? In order that Israel would not eat meat, milk, or cheese, and they would not be able to plow.) They said we know that they cannot endure this decree. When Israel heard this they were pained a great pain. They said O mercy! that we will be atoned with our God. They stood up and sold their animals whether pure or impure, and Israel was traveling on foot. Upon them [the verse] was fulfilled, \"I have seen slaves on horseback etc.\" (Ecclesiastes 10:7) THOBH said to them, [This decree is] with the sin that you withheld yourselves from ascending to Jerusalem on the three pilgrimage festivals, bringing the sacrifices, and giving the priestly gifts. Therefore [the verse] is fulfilled upon you \"Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes\" (Deuteronomy 28:31) But even so room was found in this decree. The deer, the rams and all species of pure birds were coming into and entering the houses of Israel, because they did not have doors. Israel came and grabbed them and slaughtered and ate meat. They gave praise to THOBH and they said, Blessed is he that flipped the intentions of our enemies for good. Because if their houses had doors, how could all game enter to them. THOBH answered them, You were meciful on my honor and you did not deny me, So I have prepared for you game. When the Greeks saw that Israel endured this decree, they stood up and decreed: Anyone whose wife goes to immerse herself, he will be stabbed with the sword. And the one who catches her [going to immerse] will have her as a wife and her children as slaves. When Israel saw this they refrained from having relations. When they Greeks heard this they said, since Israel is not using their beds, we will attach ourselves to them [beds]. When Israel saw this, they returned to their wives without immersion, [because] they were forced to. They said, Master of the world we are forced [to have relations] without immersion. "

And he learned of his doubt, and he clarified the matter. And this is what occured: He fasted for many days and sat in his fasting and prayed to his Creator (may His Name be Blessed) for Elijah [the Prophet] to appear to him. And behold, Elijah approached and appeared to him. And [Elijah] said to him: If you have a matter you desire from me, I will fulfill it for you. And Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said to him: I want to travel with you, and to witness the events in the world which are improved by your actions, and I will be able to learn much wisdom from you. And Elijah said to him: You will not be able to bear (tolerate) the things that you will see me do and it will be very bothersome for me to explain to you the purpose of my deeds and actions. And Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said to him: My Master, I will not ask [anything of you] or bother you with any questions, for all I want is to see is what you do and what you say and nothing more. And Elijah made a condition with him that if Rabbi Joshua asked him to know the reasoning of his actions, signs, wonders and the like, that if he asked him any question he would not travel with him anymore. Then they both went together until they came to the house of an utterly poor and destitute man who had nothing [of value] but one cow which was standing with him in the yard. And the man and his wife were sitting at the gate. And [the couple] saw [Elijah and Joshua ben Levi] coming toward them, and they went to greet them and they asked of them of their welfare and were rejoiced to meet them. And they brought them of the best of their home and they brought out before them whatever food or drink they had. And they all ate and drank. And they slept there [overnight]. And the morning came, and they rose to go about on their way. And Elijah prayed for the cow to die, and it died immediately. And they both went [on their way]. And Rabbi Joshua ben Levi saw and wondered about the matter and was overwhelmed and thought to himself \"Was there was no reward for this poor man for the honor he showed to us but to kill his cow? And he has no other one!\""

                    "1": "[From Batei Midrashot, Volume 4] (Published by S. A. Wetheimer, 1897)",
                    "2": "A Tale of Rabbi Kahana: Rabbi Kahana and his wife were blessed by God with a (only) son, whom they named Saliq. And when the boy was just five years old, Rabbi Kahana seized him with his hand and wished to take him from their home to the House of Study to learn Torah. The boy's mother spoke up and said to [Rabbi Kahana] \"where are you taking my boy?\" [Rabbi Kahana] replied \"we must entrust him to someone who is able to teach him Torah.\" She responded to him \"it would be far better for both of us to die than for for us to witness our son's departure. He must not leave us, neither to study Torah nor to pursue a trade.\" Her husband replied \"quickly, fetch your marriage contract and I will read it and pay what is stipulated in it per the conditions of a divorce settlement.\" She said to him \"what blemish do you see in me that you wish to divorce me. For is it not written: \"If a man marries a woman and it happens that she does not find favor in his eyes for he has found something indecent about her, and he will write for her a certificate of divorce...\" (Deuteronomy 24:1). Her husband replied and said \"there is no greater blemish than your action, for you preventing my son from drinking the Living Waters (i.e., the words of Torah). And \"water\" is none but Torah. As it is written \"all those who are thirsty, come to the waters\" (Isaiah 55:1). And it is written \"For they are life to those who find them\" (Proverbs 4:22). The wife then said \"let us make a compromise between you and I.\" Says he, \"how so?\" She replied \"go to the marketplace and find us an expert rabbi, and offer an agreement for him to teach our son at home for many days and years, and I will attend to him honorably, and [prepare his meals and launder his clothes].\" Immediately, the husband ran to the marketplace and found a wise man sitting and tying his tzitzit (tassels) in seven loops. [Rabbi Kahana] said to the [Wise Man] \"peace be upon you, Rabbi.\" The [Wise Man] replied \"peace be upon you, my lord.\" [Rabbi Kahana] asked \"what is your name?\" The [Wise Man] replied \"my name is Eliezer the Small One.\" [Rabbi Kahana] then asked \"do you have a wife and children?\" The [Wise Man] replied \"indeed, and they are here with me. My wife is the Torah.\" As it is written \"enjoy happiness with a woman you love all the fleeting days of life that have been granted to you under the sun—all your fleeting days. For that alone is what you can get out of life and out of the means you acquire under the sun\" (Ecclesiastes 9:9). The Wise Man continued \"And the children of my master are my students, they are now men of Torah.\" And indeed, each person is obligated to teach their child Torah once they reach the age of six or seven. As it is written \"This people I formed for Myself so that they will declare My praise.\" (Isaiah 43:21). [The Hebrew word \"this\" (זו) contains the numbers six (ו) and seven (ז)]. Immediately, the woman said to the Wise Man \"you will teach my son at our home and my son Saliq will not leave the entrance of my home.\" The Wise Man replied \"I accept your proposal.\" Immediately, Rabbi Kahana wrote an employer's contract for Rabbi Eliezer. And similarly, Rabbi Eliezer wrote an employee's contract for Rabbi Kahana and taught [Rabbi Kahana's] son Saliq. And so it happened that from the day of his birth from his mother's womb, Saliq never once crossed the doorway of his home. Instead, he remained and studied for twenty-five years, until he reached the age of thirty. And Rabbi Kahana paid Rabbi Eliezer the Small one thousand measurements of gold. ",
                    "3": "One day, Saliq, now thirty years old, departed from his home dressed in fine clothing. And he went to see the markets. He walked until he grew hungry and thirsty. He heard a water vendor shout and say \"Bottles of rose water mixed with cold water for a parched throat (Proverbs 25:25) for one kaskas (coin).\" And the vendor's family members were there saying \"Happy are those who drink!\" Saliq gestured to the water vendor and when he came over [Saliq] said \"sell one to me.\" [The vendor] said to him \"give me a kaskas (coin) and you may drink the water.\" [Saliq] replied \"but I am a scholar, am I not worthy to be given some water?\" [The vendor] said \"if you are wise, you are wise for yourself\" (Proverbs 9:12). [Saliq] replied \"I am a man of thirty years who has rigorously studied Torah, am I not worthy to be given the water?\" [The vendor] said \"if you have studied much Torah, do not assume any favor for yourself because for this you were created. You have been blessed by God to rigorously study Torah. As for me, God created me to draw water and suffer on my shoulders and sell and support my family.\""

                "2": "When Moses ascended on high, a cloud came up against him, and Moses our teacher did not know if one rides it or holds it. Immediately, the cloud opened its mouth and Moses entered it, and he walked into the firmament like a man walking on land, as it is written in the Torah: \"And Moses entered within the cloud\" [Exodus 24:18].He encountered Kemu'el, the guardian angel in charge of the twelve thousand angels of destruction who were standing at the gates of the firmament. He rebuked Moses, saying to him: \"What do you have, son of Amram, that you should come into the place of the Fiery Angels?\" Moses said to him: \"I did not come merely by myself, but only with the permission of the Holy One, Blessed be He, to receive the Torah and bring it down to Israel. Since he would not let him pass, Moses hit him with one hit, and he made him lost from the world. And Moses continued walking in the firmament until he confronted the angel Hadraniel. They said about the angel Hadraniel that he is taller than his kinsman -- six-hundred thousand parasangs [tall] -- and with each and every word that comes out of his mouth, twelve thousand bolts of fire come out of his mouth (all at once). And when he saw Moses he rebuked him, saying, \"What do you have, son of Amram, in the place of the highest holiness?\" When Moses heard his voice, Moses became afraid before him. And his eyes were dripping tears and he wanted to be let down from the cloud. Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He's mercy was aroused, and He said to Hadraniel, \"From the day I created you (all), you (all) have been an opponent of theirs [the humans]. In the beginning, when I wanted to created Adam the First, you (all) made their prosecution before me, and you (all) said to me, 'What is man that You are mindful of him?' [Psalms 8:5] And I was upset with you (all), and I burnt from you (all) many bunches with my little finger. And now you (all) are quarreling with my loyal servant, whom I brought up here to receive the Torah and to bring down to my chosen child? If it were not for the Torah that Israel is receiving, you (all) would not have a living space in the firmament!\" When Hadraniel heard this, immediately he hastened himself before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and said before him, \"Master of the Universe, it is revealed and known before you, but I did not know that he [Moses] came with your permission. Now I shall be his emissary and go before him as a student before his teacher.\" At once, Hadraniel ran and lowered himself before Moses as a student before his teacher, until they arrived at Sandalphon's fire. Hadraniel said to Moses, \"You must return, for I am not able to protect myself before Sandalphon's fire that it should not burn me.\" When Moses saw Sandalphon, he was immediately startled and hastened to go down from the cloud, and his eyes were dripping tears, and he asked for mercy before the Holy One, Blessed be He. And He answered him. Out of his great fondness for Israel, the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself descended from His Throne of Glory and stood before Moses until he passed from Sandalphon's fire. About that time it was written in the Torah: \"And YHWH passed before him\" [Exodus 34:6]. They said about Sandalphon that he was taller than his kinsman, the distance of five-hundred years, and about him it is written: \"One of the Ophanim on the ground, next to the Chayot\" [Ezekiel 1:15] -- this is Sandalphon, who stands behind the Chariot and ties crowns for its owner.Does it cross your mind that the ministering angels know where the Holy One, Blessed be He, dwells, for is it not written, \"Blessed is YHWH's glory from His place [mimkomo]\" [Ezekiel 3:12]? However, it does not say \"in His place\" [bimkomo] but rather \"from His place\" [mekomo], which teaches that the place of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not known. But Sandalphon completes the crown that crowns the place of the Holy One, Blessed be He, with sanctity. And the crown rises from its own accord and sits on the head of its master. Immediately, all the legions on high are afraid and trembling, and the chayot are silent, and the holy seraphim roar like lions, and the seraphim call out, \"Holy, holy, holy, YHWH of legions, the whole earth is filled with His glory\" [Isaiah 6:3]. And this is its interpretation: holy in the upper [world]; holy in the lower [world]; holy, the eternal YHWH, who is sanctified in the foundations of the legions of Israel. And at the time when the crown reaches the Throne of Glory, immediately the wheels of the chariot start rolling, and the Lord shakes his footstool and all the heavens are shaken. And at the time when the crown passes over the Throne of Glory to sit in its place, all the legions on high open their mouths and they say, \"Blessed is YHWH's glory from His place\" [Ezekiel 3:12]. Come and see the praise of the Holy One, Blessed be He: that when the crown arrives at His head, YHWH holds His head to receive the crown from His servants. And all the chayot and seraphim and the wheels of the chariot and the Throne of Glory and the legions of the heavens and the chashmalim and the cherubim, elevate themselves and unite and give majesty and splendor, and they proclaim, and they say in one voice: \"YHWH is king, YHWH was king, YHWH will be king forever and ever.\" And this is its interpretation: YHWH, the King before the creation of the world; YHWH, the King from the creation of the world; YHWH will reign forever and until the world to come. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, Blessed be His name, consents, and says: \"YHWH shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations, hallelujah\" [Psalm 146:10]. And when Moses passed by Sandalphon, he encountered Regyon, which is the river of fire. And in its burnings the ministering angels are immersing and renewing themselves every morning, as it says: \"They are renewed every morning—great is Your faithfulness\" [Lamentations 3:23], and so it is interpreted through Daniel [7:10]: \"A river of fire streamed forth before Him; a thousand thousands served Him; myriads upon myriads attended Him; the court sat and the books were opened.\" And this is its interpretation: \"river of fire\" -- this is called Regyon, which flows with burning embers, and it goes out before the the Throne of Glory of the Holy One, Blessed be He. And it is made with the sweat of the four chayot beneath the Throne of Glory. And they sweat fire in awe of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and from the fiery sweat, that river is made. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits on the Throne of Judgement and judges even the ministering angels, as it says: \"If He cannot trust His own servants, and casts reproach on His angels\" [Job 4:18]. And it is written: \"He puts no trust in His holy ones; the heavens are not guiltless in His sight\" [Job 15:15]. And when the ministering angels are brought to judgment, they renew themselves in that river of fire. Therefore, if the ministering angels were immersing in the river of fire, would not humans also be doing so? Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, sent it [the river of fire] away, and he [Moses] came upon Galizur, called Raziel, about whom it is said, \"Is it not at the word of the Most High, that evil and good emanate?\" [Lamentations 3:39] And why is his name Galizur? Because he reveals [gala] the taste of rock [tzur]. And why is his name Raziel? Because he is one who hears behind the curtain [ragod] what is decreed [gazer] to be, and he proclaims it in the world. And Elijah, who should be recalled for good, stands on Mount Horeb, and he hears the voice of the proclamation from His mouth, and he makes heard the voice in the world. As it is written: \"For a bird of the air may carry the utterance\" [Ecclesiastes 10:20] -- this is Raziel; \"and a winged creature may report the word\" [Ecclesiastes 10:20] -- this is Elijah.It is said about Galizur [Raziel] that he stands in front of the throne with his wings spread to receive the noxious breath from the mouth of the chayot, otherwise, all the ministering angels would be burned from the noxious breath of the chayot. And another vocation is said about Galizur: that he takes like an iron pan, which is made of fire, burning embers in the river Regyon, and he stands opposite the kings and ministers, leaders of the world, so that there luster should prevail and their awe befall the world. When Moses saw him, he trembled. Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, took him and removed him from there. He [Moses] encountered a regiment of Angels of Terror, who surround the Throne of Glory, those who are mighty of all the angels. And they wanted to burn him with the noxious breath of their mouths. Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, spread the luster of his glory and said to Moses: \"Give them an answer.\" Moses our teacher said to them: \"It is written in the Torah, 'I am the Lord your God Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage' [Exodus 20:2]; perhaps you were enslaved in Egypt and went forth as free people, that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'You shall have no other Gods' [Exodus 20:3]; perhaps there is idol worship amongst you and you are in need the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not swear' [Exodus 20:7]; perhaps there are dealings amongst you that you are in need of the Torah regarding oaths? It is written: 'Remember the Sabbath day and sanctify it' [Exodus 20:8]; perhaps there is activity amongst you that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'Honor your father and mother' [Exodus 20:12]; perhaps you have a father and mother that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not murder' [Exodus 20:13]; perhaps there is bloodshed amongst you that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not commit adultery' [Exodus 20:13]; perhaps there are women amongst you that you need the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not steal' [Exodus 20:13]; perhaps there are finances in the firmament that you are in need of the Torah? It is written, \"You shall not bear [false witness]' [Exodus 20:13]; perhaps there are false testimonies amongst you that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not covet' [Exodus 20:14]; perhaps there are houses and fields and vineyards amongst you that you are in need of the Torah?\" Immediately, all the ministering angels retracted [their desire to burn Moses] and they admitted to his words to the Holy One, Blessed be He. And they said: \"YHWH, our Master, 'How majestic is Your name throughout the earth, you who have covered the heavens with Your splendor!'\" [Psalm 8:2] And He, the Holy One, Blessed be He, taught him [Moses] the whole Torah in forty days. And when he [Moses] came to descend [from the firmament] and saw the awesomeness of the angels, and the legions of awesome angels -- trembling [zia] angels, and shuddering [chalchala] angels, and quaking [ratat] angels --  immediately, shuddering [chalchala] took hold of him and he forgot it [the Torah] all at one moment. Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, called to Yefefiah, Minister of Torah, who gave over to him [Moses] the Torah, fully prepared and preserved. And all the ministering angels became his [Moses's] admirer. And each one of them gave him something of healing and the hidden meaning of names that comes out of each and every section of Torah [parsha] and all their uses, as it says, \"You went up to the heights, having taken captives, having received tribute of men\" [Psalm 68:19]. And even the Angel of Death gave him something, as it is written: \"He places the incense and made expiation for the people\" [Numbers 17:12]. And this is the honorable use of that which was taught to him by Yefefiah, the Minister of Torah, and by Metatron, Minister of the Faces. And Moses gave it over to Elazar, and Elazar to his son Pinchas, who is Elijah the great and precious priest, he should be remembered for good. Amen."

                "2": "<b>Said Rabbi Aqibha:</b> these are the 22 letters with which the Torah was given to the tribes of Israel, and they were inscribed in a fiery pen upon the awesome and terrific crown of the Holy Blessed One, and when the Holy Blessed One sought to create the world, immediately they all came down and stood before the Holy Blessed One. This one said before Him, \"Through me create the world!\" and that one said before Him, \"Through me create the world!\" First entered ת before the Holy Blessed One and said before Him: \"Master of the world! You should make Your world through me, for through me You give Torah to Israel by the hand of Moshe, as is written (Deut. 33:4) 'Torah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">beginning with a ת</i> Moshe commanded us' etc.\" The Holy Blessed One responded and said to it, \"No.\" It said \"why?\" He said to it: \"Since I will in the future use you as a mark on the foreheads of the men moaning and groaning, the mark of the ת to destroy them from the world to come, as is said (Ezekiel 9:4) 'And the LORD said to me, pass among the city and mark a ת upon the foreheads of the men moaning and groaning for all their abominations they have made among them.'\" And what does \"mark a ת\" mean? It teachers that in the time when the Holy Blessed One set a judgement upon Jerusalem to destroy it, He called to the angel of death and said to the angel, \"Start going over Jerusalem and choose within it the righteous and wicked. Every righteous one within it, write a ת of ink on his forehead, the ת of letting them live<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the Hebrew word תחיה begins with a ת</i> that they will be let live. And every wicked one within it, write a ת of blood on their forehead, the ת of letting them die.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the Hebrew word תמות begins with a ת</i>. What distinguishes the ת from all the other letters? To teach you that the Torah saves humanity from all kinds of danger. At that very moment the attribute of Justice stood before the Holy Blessed One and said, \"Master of the world! Even the righteous within it, write on their forehead a ת of blood, the  ת of letting them die, so as to destroy all the wicked.\" Responded the Holy Blessed One and said to it, \"Why?\" It responded before Him: \"Since you did not rebuke your children with words of rebuke, nor tell them not to sin or do ugly things, things that are not decent, things that are not appropriate to do.\" Responded the Holy Blessed One and said to it, \"It is clearly known before Me that if they had been rebuked they would not have heard it.\" The attribute of Justice responded and said before Him, \"Master of the world! Even though they  were not recipients of it, they still had to be rebuked.\" Immediately the Holy Blessed One was silent and counted all the righteous who were in that generation in Jerusalem as wicked. At that time, six wounding angels were sent against Jerusalem, and the people inside it wounded it, as is written (Ezekiel 9:2) \"And behold, six men came by the upper gate that faces northwards, and each had a weapon in his hand, and one among them was wearing linen and a writing case at his waist, and they came in and stood by the bronze altar.\" And what differs north from all the directions? It teaches that all evil spirits only every come from the north,  as is written (Jeremiah 1:14) \"And he said to me, from the north will evil break upon the inhabitants of the land!\" And these are the six men who were sent against Jerusalem: anger and rage and wrath and destruction and annihilation and extermination, and each one had a double-edged sword in is hand, as written, \"each had a weapon in his hand.\" And as soon as the ת heard this matter from the Holy Blessed One, it immediately left from before His presence with a disappointed soul.",

You should make Your world through me, for through me is called Your Explicit Name<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">שמך beginning with a ש</i>, as is written (Exodus 3:15) \"This is My Name<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">שמי beginning with a ש</i> forever, and also I am the first letter of the name <i>Shaddai</i>.  The Holy Blessed One responded and said to it, \"No.\" It said \"why?\" He said to it: \"Since vanity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">שוא beginning with a ש</i> and falsehood<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">שקר beginning with a ש</i> are both called by you, and falsehood has no legs just as you have no legs.

The word <i> the children of </i> is missing, for they did an abomination, disgrace, and lewd act in Israel, and they deserve to have their descent from the righteous Benjamin retracted, and to separate them from his generations and inclusions, and they did not call them <i>children of Benjamin</i> for they did not yield to listen to their brothers, and in the remainder of places where they are called <i>children of Benjamin</i> it gave them hope and a path of repentance that they may turn from their evil deeds and repent and be called as their brothers' names the children of Benjamin.",
                "3": "<b>II) On his way to restore his monument at the River [Euphrates]</b> (II Samuel 8:3). It is written lacking in the book of Samuel, for this verse is mentioned in two places — in Samuel and Chronicles (I Chronicles 18:3), and the verse is said in two times and regarding two occasions (matters). Firstly it says <i>to restore his monument at the river,</i> and secondly <i>to set up his monument at the river Euphrates.</i> Though it is not the business of the first time to make known if it is the Euphrates or the Nile, it was written elsewhere, so <i> Euphrates </i> is read.",

The word <i>man</i> is removed from within the verse, for a human is removed from God, and thus it says (Psalms 8:6) <i> You have removed him slightly from God </i>, and his word will not come about like the word of God, thus the word <i>man</i> is removed from within the verse and suspended on the verse from the margin. If he had been meritorious in his deeds and done them for the sake of Heaven, his advice would be as the word of God.",
                "5": "<b>IV) Because [thus] the king's son is dead</b> (II Samuel 18:20). The word <i>thus</i> is lacking, because of the evil of his deeds, for he sought to kill his father and cover up the matter, and came to fornicate with his father's concubines. Though Joab said <i>because thus the king's son is dead,</i> the word <i>thus</i> is suspended on the margin, because the king's son was killed for his wrongs, but <i>thus</i> can mean <i>right</i> as in <i>rightly have the daughters of Ẓelopheḥad spoken</i> (Numbers 27:7) or <i>\"what you are saying is right.\"</i> (Genesis 44:10).",

Shimon ben Yochai who sent him from Jerusalem to Rome to the emperor, and since he was in the ship he saw in a dream Ashmadai the king of the Shemids (Demons) and said to him, ask what I will do for you? Rabbi Shimon said to him, who are you? And he said to him, I am Ashmadai (in the Gemara it is called Bar Tamalyon) whom the Holy One, blessed be He, sent to do a miracle for you. He said, Lord of the world, to the Hagar the servant of Sharai (Sarah Avraham's wife), you summoned a Heavenly Messenger to her and to me the fluency of the Prince of princes [Demon of Demons?]?! Ashmadai told him, from wherever the miracle comes, either I or an angel will fix your things. And he said to him Ashmadai I am going to go for now and enter Caesar's daughter (and weaken) [as a ghost] her, and I will shout in your name Rabbi Shimon Rabbi Shimon! Until you come, and they ask you to reconcile me to leave this house, and I say I will not leave it until Rabbi Shimon's things and his will are done. And Ashmadai went to Caesar's house and did everything he said to the Rabbi, and Caesar's daughter was standing there and he entered her because when he entered she broke all the dishes that were in her father's plate and was shouting Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai! A few days later a ship came and Rabbi Shimon was in it, they went and told the emperor, and the emperor followed him and said to him what do you want? The Jews in Jerusalem lived a generation for you. He said to him, I do not accept anything from you and I do not want from you except that you take this demon out of my house because I have no one to reign after her because I have no other seed. Rabbi Shimon went and said to him: Ashmadai, get out of here girl! He said, I will not leave until all your wishes are done to you, and he also told him several times I will not leave until your wishes are done. The king went and sent to all his elders and ministers and servants and said to them what do you tell them to do with my house where the demon has already entered and we have decreed for the Jews that they are not to breed their sons and that they are not to observe the Sabbath and that their wives are not to observe the laws of marriage, and it is the custom of our kingdom that when we pass a decree they never go back, and if the king returns in it they transfer him His kingdom is the religion of Media and Persia. One of his advisers stood up and said to him, \"My lord the king, I will tell you something, your daughter will be healed by it and you will carry out all his decrees, because this decree on the Jews is bad for us and for you,\" the counselor told him. He said to him that whoever has an enemy, what will he want from him, be he poor or rich? The king said to him, poor man. The adviser said to him: The Jews have a habit of busying themselves all week and bringing in money, on Friday they spend everything to honor the Sabbath, and now when the Sabbath is decreed for them, they will be left with spending on the Sabbath and they will collect money and rebel against you, and if you return the Sabbath to them, they will spend a lot of money on it and be poor. The king told them, to give them back the Sabbath. The same counselor also told him if a person has enemies what will he want from them, be they many or few? The king told him, few. He said to him, my lord the king, the Jews make their sons circumcise and they are eight days old, when one lives a hundred die. The king said also to return the word to them. The counselor said to him, my lord the king, this is how it is in the matter of nudges, if the women of Israel lay down nudity laws, they will not have multiple seeds because they will keep seven days of blood days and memory of clean days. The king said they put their religion in bonds when he was. Then the king said to Rabbi Shimon, I have fulfilled your request, tell the demon that came out of my house. Rabbi Shimon decreed for Ashmadai and he left the king's daughter, and because restored health of His daughter, the king gave Shimon the gift that he brought him and gave him another large gift and wrote him a letter of approval for the Seridiot (officer, chief) he had in Jerusalem, and Rabbi Shimon went to Jerusalem happy and kind-heated and the decrees were canceled.",
                "3": "And this is Rabbi Shimon, who was bound in a cave before from the emperor, and was tortured for forty days and nights and prayed before God, and thus he said in his prayer: Blessed are you, God, our God and the God of our fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the great, mighty and terrible God, who buys heaven and earth alive and subsisting forever Until and forever forever, glory be glorified be glorified be adorned be glorified be unique that you are the King of kings and Lord of lords, one whose name is in you and yours is your name, you disappear from the sight of all living and your name disappears, you are a wonder and the wonder of your name, you are the only one and your name is unique, you are the one who chose Abram and brought him out of the light of the Chaldean's and announced his sorrow from the enslavement of kings Let your sons be enslaved, and now I will ask you, O God, that you will open the gates of prayer for me and send me an angel to inform me when the Messiah son of David will come and how he will gather the waves of Israel from all the places that were scattered there, and how many wars will befall them after they are gathered, and the matter will be explained to me in the goodness of God, and when the wonders will end.

And I answered and said to the one speaking to me, what are you saying, Lord? He said to me stand your ground, and at his words, I stood trembling and I said to him what is your name? He told me why it is that you ask my name and it is wonderful, and I told him when the Redeemer of Israel will come, he said to me, and he will see the children of Israel and God knows. He immediately passed the nest in front of me. I asked him, what are these? He said to him, these are the nests. I also saw the kingdom of Ishmael, who will be after the Kenites. I immediately cried a great cry and said to him, Lord, that he has horns and talons to trample Israel with. They told him. While I was talking with him, an angel whose name was Metatron touched me and woke me up like a man waking from his sleep, and when I saw him I stood trembling and my labor turned on me and I did not hold back my labors as labor labors, and he said to me, Shimon! And I say, I am. And he said to me, know that God sent me to you to inform you of your question that you asked before him. Now when you saw the Kenites and the kingdom of Ishmael in his house, you did not want to weep except for the kingdom of Ishmael alone, who at the end of her reign will slay in Israel a great slaughter that has no measure, and you will decree upon Israel severe decrees, and it says that everyone who reads the Torah will be stabbed with the sword and you will return some of Israel to their laws, and the kingdoms of the Kenites will come at that time to Jerusalem and conquer and they killed in it more than three hundred thousand people, and because of the pressure that oppresses Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, sends Ishmaelites among them and make war with them in order to save Israel from them, and a foolish man stands and speaks falsely about God, and he conquers the land, and there will be enmity between them and between the sons of Esau. I answered Metatron and said to him, Lord, and is my son Ishmael salvation for Israel? He said to him, and not so said the prophet Isaiah, and he saw a chariot, a pair of horsemen, a donkey riding a camel (Isaiah 21:7), a chariot - this is the kingdom of Medi and Persia, a chariot - this is the kingdom of Yon, horsemen - this is the kingdom of Edom, a donkey riding - this is the Messiah who is said to be poor And he rides on a donkey (Zechariah 9:9), he rides a camel - this is the kingdom of Ishmael, in whose days the kingdom of the Messiah will arise, that is why a donkey's rider preceded a camel's rider, and a camel's rider will prevail at the coming of the Messiah, and wise men will die, and the power of sons of wickedness shall be increased. And further, he saw the Kenites, and that is what parable did Bileam the wicked see, but because Bileam saw the tribe of Kenites coming to stand and enslave Israel, he began saying \"strengthen is your seat, I see a vision that there is a hunger, but your strong Savior will come from East\"[edit. The gate of King, the Golden gate, is the gate of Messiah, in Ezekiel 10:19] (Meaning of Savior - the instrument of music, And the matter of this comes from the advice of the mocking that Bileam said about Israel)",

Peace from all sides, and he would love sheep and die in peace. And another king will stand up under him and hold the kingdom with his sword and bow, and there will be a fight in his days, sometimes in the east and sometimes in the west, sometimes in the north and sometimes in the south, and he will make war with everything, and when the Nirdon in the west falls on the sons of Ishmael in Damascus, the kingdom of Ishmael will fall, and at that time God said, Shabbar, the bed of the wicked. (Isaiah 14:5), and while the mighty sons of Kedar are still with him, a north easterly wind will blow against him and many victims will fall from him, the first on a stag, the second on the Euphrates, and the third between them, and he flees before them, and his sons will capture him and kill him and hang him on the trees. On that day, God will whistle to the fly, and the future of the \"To whistle to the bees who are in the land of Assyria and make war with the Ashkenazim and the first king leads them and finds that he rebelled against their lord, as it is said: Thus said the Lord, the Holy Redeemer of Israel, to the abominable of a heathen, to the servant of governors (Isaiah 39:7), and who is the servant of governors?\" This is what the Canaanites say, that they are detested by all the nations, for a slave of rulers to be a slave of rulers and he rebels against his master and they gather to him and gather with them people who rebelled against their masters and make war with the sons of Ishmael and kill their mighty men and inherit their wealth and property, and they are extremely skinned people and wear black and come from the east and they are Bitter and hasty, as it is said that I raise up the Chaldean's, the Gentiles are bitter and hasty (Habakkuk 1:6), and all of them are horsemen, as it is said, \"Bitter and hasty'' (Nahum 3:3), And they come from a far country to live in a neighborhood that is not his, and they go up to the top of a mountain, and it is a mountain from the top of Israel, and they break into the temple and put out the candles and tear down the doors. And there will be four other kings, two of whom will be born and other years will stand over them, and in their days a son of David will arise, as it is said, and in the days of \"Malachi'a Inun\" (The Sad King) (Daniel 2:4). And the image of the first king is an old man and he does not have much beard, and the king is kneeling, his eyes are beautiful and his hair is beautiful and black, and they fail him (see Daniel's entry). And after him another will stand in dispute, and many soldiers will stand on the river Euphrates, and one day his soldiers in the north and in the south will fall and he will escape and be captured and imprisoned, and all the days he is in prison there will be peace in the land. And the fourth king loves silver and gold, and he is old and tall and has a mole about the size of his right foot, and he makes copper coins and buries them and stores them under a flower with silver and gold, and they are put away to the Messiah King, As it is said, \"And I have given you treasures of darkness and hidden treasures\" (Isaiah 3:3), And in his days a western horn will strike and he will send two recruits and they will kill the people of the east, and he will send others, and at the beginning of the week (Shemita) the first year there will be no rain in it, and in the second there will be half a famine, and in the third, there will be great famine and there will be no rain, and in the fourth, there will be a moderate one, and on the fifth, there will be a great abundance, and on the sixth, one star will rise from the east And he will rule by the scepter of fire like a lance, and they say, Oh, this star is ours, and it is not so, but the parable of Israel, which was said through the star of Jacob, and when it rises in the first watch of the night until two hours, and gathers fifteen days in the east and turns to the west and makes fifteen days, and if more - it is good for Israel.",

The angel said to him, after all this the people of the West increase with large soldiers and they come mixed up and make war with the people of the East in their country and kill them, and the rest flee before them and come to Alexandria, and they will be chased by the people of the West and come there, and there will be a great war, and the people of the East will flee from there and come as far as Egypt and stay And they will take it from a customer and make it a wasteland, to fulfill what was said Egypt will be a wasteland (Joel 4:9). And they passed through the land of the deer and it was consumed by them, and everyone who was captured will not return until the Messiah comes, and when I heard this I wept very much. The angel said to him, Simon! what are you crying for I told him, Abraham's sons Isaac and Jacob will not have an escape in his days. He said to me, the matter is very difficult, if you put meat on the fire, you will not be able to escape from its smell, so Israel is not saved, and anyone who comes into the room and runs away and hides will be saved. He will fall by the sword (ibid. 13:15), and they will pass through the land of the deer and horses, as it is said, \"And he came through the lands and washed and passed over\" (Daniel 11:30), and they came to the rivers of the valleys and they were in the middle of it, and there will be a great war that all the prophets prophesied about and they will become streams and the waters of the Euphrates to the blood, and the rest will not be able to drink from it, and from there the kingdom of the East will break. And after all these, a bold-faced king will stand and do three and a half years, and at the beginning of his reign, when he stands, he takes the rich and diverts (a missing language, Zephaniah 3:15) from their wealth and kills them, and money will not escape its owners, as it is said that their silver and gold cannot be redeemed (Ezekiel 7 19), and his counsel and his thoughts will not stand on him, and anyone who mentions Shema Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one, will be killed, and anyone who says, The God of Abraham will be killed. 7:25), times - they are the times, and religion - is the Torah, as it is said that the fire of religion is for him (Deuteronomy 33), and in his days there will be great trouble for Israel, and everyone who is exiled to the upper Galilee will escape, as it is said that there will be a plague on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem (Joel 3:5) Witness Demati condemns and kills Israel until he reaches Damascus, and when he reaches Damascus, God Almighty gives help and success to Israel, and in his days there will be strife and war in the world, and a city will fight with its friend and a country with a country and a nation against a nation and a nation against a nation, and there will be no peace for those who come and go, as it is said And my troubles came to man, and they went as blind (Zephaniah 1:17). And with the Lord there will be turmoil and trouble upon them for three years, and they will be given in his hand until the end of the three years, as it is said and they will be in his hand [עַד עִדָּן וְעִדָּנִין וּפְלַג עִדָּן] until Iddan and Iddain and peleg Iddan (Daniel 7:25), Iddan - one year, Iddain - two years, peleg Iddan - half a year, It is found that there are three years from the cancellation of the circumcision and prayer, which is said to have taken place at the time of the removal of the tabernacle and to give a glimpse of heaven for one thousand two hundred and ninety days (ibid. 12:11), and they are three and a half years. And there arose a king who put them to the frost, as it was said, and we gave the shadow of the desert (ibid. 11) and he was in front of you for three months, and after that, the sons of Ishmael made war with the Edomites in the valley of Acre, and immediately the Assyrians came upon them and drove them back, as it was said, \"How long shall Assyria rest\" (Numbers 24:22), and the fleet of the Hittites (ibid. 24) - these are Edomites who are destined to stand at the end of days, and when they go out as thieves they go out, as it is said if thieves come to you, etc. (Obadiah 1:5), and make war with the sons of Ishmael and kill A great number of them, and a great number of them gathered at streets of Akko, crushed with the iron and shame, and a water tank was brake with his fingers, and rush, rabble in Suswan (castle), and they joined legions with their people from Edom, and they came and made war in the valley of Acre until the horse was soaked up to its thigh in blood, and the children of Israel fled until they came to the valley of Jericho, and there they stood and said to one of his comrades, \"Here we are fleeing, and let us rest.\" We bowed down and changed, and returned and waged another war in the Valley of Megiddo, and the Edomites fled and got into the ships, and a wind arose and brought them to Assyria, and they tormented the Assyrians and crossed the river. And at the end of nine months, the Assyrians went out and the Israelites and the Romans perished, as it was said, \"How long shall Assyria be troubled\"(Deuteronomy 24:20). And when you see Assyrians coming out and walking in the land of Israel, they are making peace, and Elijah the late comes out and announces peace to them as it was said, and it will be an Assyrian peace because it will come to our land (Micah 5:4), and the sons of Italy want to fight with them and the sons of Ishmael will almost return the kingdom to them, and there are not enough to take out their wives until Assyria captures them, and immediately a voice goes out and proclaims everywhere to the children of Israel: Go out and avenge God's vengeance on Edom, as it is said, I have given my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel (Ezekiel 25:14), and immediately the young men of the Israelites gather and listen and they reign A king from the seed of David reigned over them, and a dispute fell between one and another, and the children of the Land of Israel transgressed against the seed of David to fulfill what was said, and Israel transgressed in the house of David until this day (2 Chronicles 10:19).",
                "7": "And these and those come and take hold, and a voice comes out and chirps what has been is what will be (Ecclesiastes 1:9) - He is the Holy One who was before the creation of the world, and He who will be after the loss of the world. And what we do is what he will do (there), and she replies and says that when Joshua did to Jericho and to the queen, so they did with the prohibition and with the allowed, and they say that there is no covenant land with us when he was with Joshua, and he replies that there was nothing in the land but the two tablets of stone and their seal. And these and those come and take hold, and a voice comes out and chirps what has been is what will be (Ecclesiastes 1:9) - He is the Holy One who was before the creation of the world, and He who will be after the loss of the world. And what we do is what he will do (there), and she replies and says that when Joshua did to Jericho and to the queen, so they did with the prohibition and the prohibition, and they say that there is no covenant land with us when he was with Joshua, and she replies that there was nothing in the land but the two tablets of stone and their seal. With great rejoicing and saying Hear Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one, they surround Jericho, and immediately the wall falls under it and we enter it and find the young men dead in its streets to fulfill what was said therefore shall fall in its holes in its streets and all the men of war shall bleed on that day (Jeremiah 39:26), And they where killing in it for three days and three nights, and then they gathered all its spoil into its street, and a rumor came from them to the Ai and they were greatly afraid.",
                "8": "And again I returned to pray before God with fasting and sackcloth and ashes until I saw, and behold, a hand touched me and set me on my feet and said to me, Ask a righteous man what you will ask, and I asked him and I told him in the last days of God how all Israel will be gathered from the four corners of the earth, and how their exodus will be under the hand of the kings, and if they go out for the portion they are going out, and how will they go and what will they be able to do? I would like you to tell me these things and the like until the end of the whole thing. And clouds appeared from the gates of heaven and he said to me: At the end of the reign of the sons of Ishmael, the Romans will go out against Jerusalem and make war with the sons of Ishmael and the land will be conquered before them, and they will come into it and kill many of the sons of Ishmael in it, and they will make many dead in it, and they will take captives from the daughters of Ishmael, a great captivity, and they will take the brains out of the babies and butcher every day a thousand babies. \"And at that time He created a great deal for Israel, and at that time God will awaken the tribes of Israel and they will come to Jerusalem, the holy city, and they will find in the Torah it is written, \"And God will go before them their day in a pillar of cloud\" (Exodus 13:21). And another scripture says, \"The Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will provide for you\" (Isaiah 12:12), and they will walk in a cloud and a fog, and they will make war with the Edomites, and they will kill a great number of them, and their name will go out in the world where the tribes came. from being a Gentile until that time, and at that time all your people who are found written in the book will flee (Daniel 12:1), and the nations will stand against Israel and kill many of them and many criminals from the peoples of the land, and torture many of the followers in chains to leave the Torah of God, and more that they will be in this tribulation for days For a few, God will bring a great and strong wind and a great and thick black famine, the like of which has not been seen in the world, and from that wind, the Almighty will scatter the tribes in every city and city, and about them, it will be said, Who are these? Bread and the Holy One with his blessing will bring back to Israel the salt for the selet, and at that time it was said that there would be a piece of barley in the land at the top of the mountains (Psalms 15:16), (see Midrash Ecclesiastes 5 what happened). And Nehemiah son of Hoshiel stood up and made letters in the word of God, and a king stood up and disbelieved in the law, and showed himself as a servant of God, and his heart was not right with him. And there came a great thunder in the world, and the whole world was afraid of it, and Israel gathered to Nehemiah son of Hoshiel, and the king of Egypt would make peace with him and kill all the countries around Jerusalem, such as Tiberias, Damascus, and Ashkelon, and they would hear God, and terror and fear would fall upon them. And the sign that will be at that time is that the stars will appear as blood, and at that time it is said that the sun will turn into darkness and the moon into blood (Joel 3:4), and God will send ten plagues in the Holy of Holies as He sent in Egypt, to fulfill what was said, and it was on that day that Joseph will add again His hand is to buy the remnant of his people (Isaiah 11:11). It was said that there is a marble stone in Rome and it is a beautiful girl figure from the six days of Genesis, and from The sons of Belial (The wickedness) are from the nations of the world and you lie between them and you pass, and at the end of nine months it splits and there came forth a male child in the form of a man, twelve cubits long and two cubits wide, and his eyes are crooked red, the hair of his head is red as gold and his legs are green, and he has two talons and they call him Armilus. And he came to Edom and said to them, I am your Messiah, I am your God, and he misled them and immediately they believed in him and they made him their king, and all the sons of Esau and none were with him. They bring a book... and he says to them that I have given before you and I say to them I am the Lord your God and I am your Messiah and your God, and at the same time he sends to Nehemiah and all Israel, and says to them bring me your Torah and testify to me that I am God. And immediately all Israel will tremble and be afraid, and at that hour Nehemiah will stand up and three men with him from the sons of Ephraim and will go with him and sit with them and call before him I will stand and you will not have it, and he says there is nothing of this in your Torah? I (I don't?) leave you until you believe that I am God the way the nations of the world believed in me, and immediately Nehemiah stands against him and tells him you are not God but Satan, and Armilus says to them why did you lie to me, I will order you to be killed and says to his servants take him to Nehemiah, and immediately thirty thousand heroes will arise of Israel and made war with him and killed two hundred thousand from the camp of Armilus, and Armilus also went out and gathered all the soldiers of the nations of the world, and made war with the Israelites and killed a thousand [and] thousand of Israel and more. And I darkened the land with a day of light (Amos 8:9), and the rest of Israel fled to the wilderness of the nations and sat there forty-five days without bread or water because the grass of the field would be their food. (Daniel 11:22), and he returns and sets his sights on Jerusalem to be destroyed a second time, as it is said, and the tents of our deliverance shall fall.",
                "9": "Between days the holy deer came to the mountain and came to its end and there was no one to help him (Daniel 11:5). And at that time Michael the great minister will stand and blow the shofar three times, as it was said and it would happen on that day that he would blow a great shofar (Isaiah 27:13), and that shofar is the right horn of Isaac's ram, and God will extend it to a thousand cubits, and he will blow the sound and the Messiah will be revealed Son of David and Elijah, and they both go to Israel, who are in the wilderness of the nations, and Elijah says to them, this is the Messiah, and restores their hearts and strengthens their hands, as it is said, \"Strengthen weak hands and feeble knees, embrace them, say to those who are quick of heart, be strong, do not be afraid\" (Isaiah 35:4). And all the children of Israel heard the sound of the shofar and knew that he had redeemed Israel, as it is said that God redeemed Jacob (there), and the lost came to the land of Assyria. And immediately the fear of God falls on the nations and on all the nations, and Israel returns with the Messiah until they come to the Judean desert and are recorded with all the children of Israel, and they come to Jerusalem and ascend the steps of the House of David that remain from the destruction, and the Messiah sits there. And Armilus heard that there was a king standing for Israel, and he gathered soldiers from all over the world and came to the Messiah and Israel's king, and the Almighty will fight for Israel, and he says to the Messiah, return to my right hand, and the Messiah says to Israel, gather and stand and see the salvation of God, and immediately the Almighty will come out and fight with them, As it is said, \"And the Lord will go forth and fight against these nations\" (Zechariah 14:3), and it is written, \"At that time I will be your father, and at that time I will gather you, for I will give you to his name and to be glorified among all the peoples of the earth\" (Zephaniah 3:20). Amen, the time will come and that time.",

Sie fragten: „Wer hat den Weinberg erschaffen?“. Er sagte: „Gott“. Sie fragten: „Du mischst dich in eine Sache ein, die nicht dir gehört? Gott erschuf ihn und du schneidest seine Früchte ab?“. Er sagte: „Würde ich den Weinberg nicht pflügen, nicht, jäten, nicht düngen, käme doch keine Frucht von ihm.“ Sie sagten: „Du Dummkopf, hast du nicht den Vers gehört `Des Menschen Tage sind wie Gras, er blüht wie eine Blume des Feldes´(Ps. 103:15). Genau wie das Gewächs, wenn es nicht gejätet und gedüngt wird, wächst nichts und wenn es wächst und nichts trinkt, dann stirbt es.
