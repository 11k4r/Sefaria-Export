This is the first person, said the Kadosh Baruch Hu, the first person that I put into Gan Eden, and I commanded them and they transgressed my commands and I judged them according to exile and banishment, and I mourned for them, [saying] “How!?”I put them in Gan Eden, as it says “Hashem Elohim took the person and left them in Gan Eden” (Breishit 2:15), and commanded them, as it says “Hashem God commanded the person, saying….” (Breishit 2:16). And the person transgressed my commandments, as it says  “And what about the tree that I commanded you about [did you eat from it?]...” (Breishit 3:11), and I judged them according to exile, as it says  “[God] drove the person out…” (Breishit 3:24), and I judged the person according to banishment, as it says  “Hashem banished them from Gan Eden” (Breishit 3:23), and I mourned them, crying “where”, as it says  “[God] said to them ‘Where.’” (Breishit 3:9). “איכה” is written. Therefore only his son entered with him to the land of Israel, as it says  “I brought you to the farmland” (Jeremiah 2:7) and commanded them, as it says  “Command the Israelites” (Vayikra 24:2) and they transgressed my commandments, as it says  “All of the Israelites have transgressed Your Torah” (Daniel 9:11), and I judged them according to exile, as it says  “From my house, I will divorce them” (Hosea 9:15), and I judged them according to banishment, as it says  “Banish them from my presence and let them go out” (Jeremiah 15:1), and I mourned them “How it dwells alone” (Lamentations 1:1).

Isaiah said: \"Alas, she was as a prostitute”. Jeremiah said: \"Alas, she sits in solitude.\" Rabbi Levi said a parable of a mistress who had three maidservants. One saw her in her tranquility, one saw her in her recklessness, and one saw her in her shame. So too, Moses saw Israel in its honor and tranquility and said: \"Alas, I alone will carry their burden.\" Isaiah saw them in their recklessness and said: \"Alas, she was as a prostitute.\" Jeremiah saw them in their shame and said: \"Alas, she sits\"They [the students of the academy] asked Ben Azzai, and so said they: \"Our teacher, expound for us one thing from the scroll of lamentations.\" He said to them \"Israel was not exiled until they rejected the One of the world, the Bris Milah which was given to twenty generations, the ten commandments, and the five books of the Torah, a number [that has the numerical equivalent of the word] \"Alas\". Rabbi Levi said: \"Israel was not exiled until they rejected the 36 covenants in the Torah and the 10 commandments, a number [that has the numerical equivalent of the verse] \"Alas, she sits in solitude.\" Rabbi Berechiya in the name of Rabbi Avdimei from Haifa [spoke] of a king that had a son. When he was doing the will of his father, he would dress him in fine clothes. When he was not doing his will, he would dress him in garments of cloth. So too, Israel. Whenever they were doing the will of the Holy One Blessed Be He, it is written: \"I will clothe you in embroidered garments,\" and Rabbi Sima said: \"A purple robe,\" and Onkelos translates it [into Aramaic] as: \"patchwork embroidery.\" Whenever they were not doing the will of the Holy One Blessed Be He, he dressed them in garments of cloth, thus it is written: \"Alas, she sits in solitude.\" Rabbi Nachman said in the name of Shmuel, who said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi: The Holy One Blessed Be He called to the ministering angels. He said to them, \"When a mortal king mourns the death of a relative, what is he accustomed to do?\" They said, \"He ties sackcloth on his doors.\" He said to them, \"I, too, will do this.\" Thus it is written: \"I clothe the heavens with darkness, and its garment sackcloth.\" [G-d asked further] \"A mortal king, what is he accustomed to do?\" They said to him \"He extinguishes his lights.\" He said to them, \"I, too, will do this.\" As it is said: \"The sun and the moon have darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining.\" A mortal king, what is he accustomed to do? Turn over his beds. I, too, will do this. As it is said: \"Until thrones were lifted, and the Ancient of Days sat\" [which is to say of the thrones] if you will, that they were turned over. A mortal king, what is he accustomed to do? He goes barefoot. I, too, will do this. As it is said: \"The Lord, His way is with tempest and storm, and cloud is the dust of His feet.\" A mortal king, what is he accustomed to do? He tears his purple robe. I, too, will do this. As it is written, \"The Lord has done what He devised, He has carried out His word,\" and Rabbi Yakov of the Village of Chana explained the meaning of \"He has carried out his word\" as \"He has torn his purple robe\". A mortal king, what is he accustomed to do? He sits and he is silent. I, too, will do this. As it is said: \"Let him sit alone and silent.\" A mortal king who is mourning, what is he accustomed to do? He sits and he cries. I, too, will do this. As it is written: \"And the Lord, G-d of Hosts, called on that day, for weeping, and for lamenting and for baldness.\" Another interpretation follows. \"Alas!\" Jeremiah said to them, \"What did you see in idolatry that you so eagerly went after it? If it had possessed a mouth for [verbal] give-and-take, we would have said so. But it was said [both] about them, and by them [to the contrary]. It was said about them: \"So says the Lord, of the way of the nations you shall not learn, and from the signs of the heaven be not dismayed, for the nations are dismayed from them.\" and it was said by them: \"So shall you say to them, the gods who did not make the heavens and the earth, etc.\" Not like these is the portion of Jacob! For He is the Creator of everything, and Israel is His inherited portion, G-d of Hosts is His name. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Nechemiah. Rabbi Yehuda says: the language of \"Alas\" is none other than a language of admonishment, thus it is said: \"How do you say, we are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us, etc.\" And Rabbi Nechemiah says \"Alas\" is none other than a language of lament, thus it is said: \"And G-d called out to the man and said to him, where are you,\" woe unto you! When was the scroll of lamentations said? Rabbi Yehuda says: In the days of Jehoakim it was said. Rabbi Nechemiah said to him: And do you cry over the dead before he has died?! Rather, when was it said? After the destruction of the Temple, and here is your solution [or proof]: \"Alas, she sits in solitude.\""

But now it is turned (<i>hafukhah</i>) on me\". Rabbi Acha said: \"Like a column fragment which rolls (<i>mithapekhet</i>) around the palace and it lodges on a pebble and is stopped (<i>nismekhah</i>), so: \"Your fury lies heavy (<i>samkhah</i>) upon me (Psalm 88:8)\". \" It sweeps away my honor (<i>nedivati</i>) like the wind (Job 30:15): Humans who are willing (<i>nedivim</i>) and are seen to come to me, redemption is in their hands, and you sweep them away like the wind. \"My dignity (<i>yeshu'ati</i>) vanishes like a cloud (Job 30:15)\": Humans who are willing and are seen to come to me, salvation (<i>yeshu'ah</i>) is in their hands, but you drive them away like a cloud, as it is said: \"<b>Alas! Hashem in His wrath Has shamed the daughter of Zion</b> (Lamentations 2:1)\". And it is written: \"Like the nations that Hashem will cause to perish before you, so you will perish (Deuteronomy 8:20): you will say: \"Why [will you perish like the Canaanites]?\". Because [they on account] of the priest and the prophet, so too because of the priest and the prophet, and \"Why?\". Because of the shofar and trumpet, so too because of the shofar and trumpet, and  \"Why?\". Because of the fourteen [nations] as it is said: \"Denites and Apharesatechites, Tarpelites, Apharesites, Archavites, Babylonians, Susites, Dehites, and and other peoples whom the great and glorious Osnappar deported and settled (Ezra 4:9-10)\". And you will say: \"There are fourteen, as it is written: \"In that day, their fortress cities shall be like the deserted sites which the Horesh and the Amir abandoned (Isaiah 17:19)\". What does Amir mean? Rabbi Pinchas said: \"As I said (<i>kide'imrei</i>)\". Rabbi Yehudah son of Rabbi Simon said: \"As it is said in the Torah, it is written: \"Like the nations that Hashem will cause to perish before you\". You will say: \"Why [did they perish]?\". With the fall of a wall, as it is written: \"And the wall fell upon them (Joshua 6:20)\". So these too by the fall od a wall, as it is written: \"They enter the clouds (<i>be'avim</i>), they clamber up the rocks (Jeremiah 4:29)\", so these with clouds: \"<b>Alas! Hashem in His wrath Has shamed (<i>ya'iv</i>) the daughter of Zion</b>\"....",

Hashem in His wrath Has shamed the daughter of Zion</b> (Lamentations 2:1)\": Rabbi Chama son of Rabbi Chanina said [in Aramaic]: \"How Hashem condemned the daughter of Zion in his anger. There is a similarity in pronunciation between \"anger\" (<i>chayyayva</i>) and \"shame/cloud\" (<i>'ayayva</i>)\". Rabbi Samuel son of Nachmani said: \"How Hashem felt pain in anger\": there is a similarity in pronunciations between \"pain\" (<i>kheiva</i>) and \"shame/cloud\" (<i>'eyyva</i>)\". And the Rabbis said: \"How Hashem punished in anger\" [<i>shayyeim/'eyyva</i>]\". \"<b>Has cast down from heaven to earth the majesty of Israel</b>\": Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Acha in the name of Rabbi Chanina son of Rabbi Abbahu: \"There is a parable of a king who had a son. He wept and he put him on the trailing stems of a vine. He wept and he put him in his arms. He wept and he put him on his shoulder, but he messed himself on him and he threw him from his hand to the ground. He did not throw him down as he lifted him up, and lifted up as he was raised, but he was raised slowly. Thus: \"I have pampered Ephraim, taking them in My arms (Hosea 11:3)\". And further it says: \" I will make Ephraim do advance plowing; Judah shall do [main] plowing! Jacob shall do final plowing! (Hosea 10:11)\". And thus it says: \"<b>Has cast down from heaven to earth the majesty of Israel</b>\". Another interpretation: \"<b>Has cast down from heaven to earth the majesty of Israel</b>\": Rabbi Yehoshua son of Rabbi Nachman said: \"There is a parable of the inhabitants of a province who made a crown for the king. They provoked him and he suffered it. Then they provoked him and he suffered it. Finally a third time and the king said to them: \"All of you are provoking me, is it because of the crown you crowned me with? So then I throw it in your faces\". So said the Holy One, blessed be He, to Israel: \"All of you are provoking me, is it because of the image of Jacob engraved on my throne? So then I throw it in your faces, and so: \"<b>Has cast down from heaven to earth the majesty of Israel</b>\"\"",
                "2": "\"<b>He did not remember His Footstool On His day of wrath</b> (Lamentations 2:1)\": Rabbi Chanina son of Rabbi Yitzchak said: \"The Holy One, blessed be He, did not remember the blood between the feet of the old man, as it is said: \"Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin (Genesis 17:24)\"\". Rabbi Yudan said: \"As a king who captured his enemies and killed them, and the people of the province struggled in the blood of his enemies. At a later time they provoked the king and he threw them our and sent them out of the palace. They said to him: \"Does not the king remember how we struggled in the blood of his enemies?\" So Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: \"Do you not remember for us the blood which was in Egypt, as it is said: \"They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses (Exodus 12:7)\"?\". Another interpretation: \"<b>He did not remember His Footstool On His day of wrath</b>\": this is not the footstool but the Temple. See! It is written: \"Exalt Hashem our God and bow down to His footstool; He is holy! (Psalms 99:5)\". \"<b>On His day of wrath</b>\": Rabbi Acha said: \"There was one day of wrath for the Holy One, blessed be He, but if Israel had made repentance, it would have dissolved\". \"Then He called loudly in my hearing, saying, “Approach, you men in charge of the city, each bearing his weapons of destruction! (Ezekiel 9:1)” : Until when did the sin of the golden calf apply? Rabbi Berechyah and there are those saying Rabbi Nechemyah son of Eleazar said: \"Until the calves of Jeroboam son of Nebat. See! It is written: \"When I would heal Israel, The guilt of Ephraim reveals itself And the wickedness of Samaria (Hosea 7:1)\". The Holy One, blessed be He, said: \"I have come to heal Israel from the sin of the calf and the wickedness of Samaria was revealed\"\". Rabbi Ishmael son of Nachmani in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: \"Until the destruction of the Temple, as it is said: \"\"Approach, you men in charge (<i>pequddot</i>) of the city, each bearing his weapons of destruction!\"\". And it is written: \"But when I make an accounting, I will bring them to account (<i>paqdi ufaqadti</i>) for their sins (Exodus 32:34)\". It is written: \"And six men entered by way of the upper gate that faces north, each with his club in his hand; and among them was another, clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. They came forward and stopped at the bronze altar (Ezekiel 9:2)\". It is written: \"Six men\" but are there not five decrees? As it is written: \"“Follow him through the city and strike; show no pity or compassion (Ezekiel 9:5)\". And it is written: \"Kill off graybeard, youth and maiden, women and children; but do not touch any person who bears the mark (Ezekiel 9:6)\". Rabbi Yochanan said to the harsh angel among them, this is Gabriel, as it is said: \"and among them was another, clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist\". Three things this angel served as: as an accountant <i>quaestor</i>, an executioner and a high priest. An accountant, as it is written: \"with a writing case at his waist\". As an executioner, as it is said: \" He has doomed them, consigned them to slaughter (Isaiah 34:2)\". As a high priest, as it is said: \"And among them was another, clothed in linen\", and it is written about the priest: \"He shall be dressed in a sacral linen tunic (Leviticus 16:4)\". \"Each with his club in his hand\": Weapons of fighting, weapons of destruction, and weapons of exile. Weapons of fighting: \"Each with his club in his hand\". And weapons of destruction: \" That he make all the altar-stones Like shattered blocks of chalk (Isaiah 27:9)\". And weapons of exile, as it is written: \"You are My war club, [My] weapons of battle (Jeremiah 51:20)\". And it is written: \"They came forward and stopped at the bronze altar\": Rabbi Yehudah son of Simon said: \"To the place of permission\". And the Rabbis say: \"He stands and remembers the sins of Ahaz, as it is written: \"And I will decide about the bronze altar (2 Kings 16:15)\". What does \"I will decide\" mean? Rabbi Pinchas said: \"He engraved it and put blemised ones on it, and so it was said: \"The priest will not decide (Leviticus 13:36)\". \"And Hashem said to him (<i>elav</i>) “Pass through the city, through Jerusalem (Ezekiel 9:4)\": \"To his divine one (<i>elo</i>)\" is written. Rabbi Shimon son of Lakish said: \"To the angel that is harsh among them (that is Gabriel). \"\"And put a mark (<i>tav</i>)\"\": Rab Nachman said: \"These are people who follow the Torah from alef to tav [a to z]. And the Rabbis say: \"The condemned ones and separated ones\". And Rab said: \"Because it was spelled in every case with a tav, \"be (<i>tihei</i>)\" and \"live (<i>techei</i>)\" [are symbolized]. Rabbi Chanina son of Yitzchak said: \"The memory of their fathers is ended (<i>tammah</i>)\". Rabbi Hoshaya sent and said to Rabbi Simon: \"Because you serve in the house of the exilarch, why do you not reproach them?\". He said to him: \"If only we were among those about whom it is written: \"the men who moan and groan (Ezekiel 9:4)\". He said to him: \"And is it not from them the beginning of the punishment, as it is written: \"To the others He said in my hearing (Ezekiel 9:5)\"? Rabbi Eleazar said: \"Forever the Holy One, blessed be He, did not attach his name to evil but to good. See! It is written: \"To the others God said in my hearing\" is not written alone, but rather \"To the others He said in my hearing “Follow him through the city and strike; show no pity or compassion. Kill off graybeard, youth and maiden, women and children; but do not touch any person who bears the mark. Begin here at My Sanctuary” (Ezekiel 9:5-6)\". How can this be? Rather, at that time the prosecutor was angry before the throne of glory and said before him: \"Master of the universe, who from them was killed for your name? Who from them was wounded on his head for your name? Who from them gave his life for your name?\" He said: \"For none among them is this document\"\". Rabbi Ayyvu said: \"The Holy One, blessed be He, said: \"The Temple will be destroyed but let your hand not touch the righteous\". Rabbi Yehudah son of Rabbi Simon said: \"For it and them was this document\". Rabbi Tanchuma and Rabbi Abba in the name of Rabbi Abba: \"From eternity the Holy One, blessed be He, did not speak a good word and retract it, but here he retracted it. See! It is written: \"Begin here at My Sanctuary\". Do not read \"at my sanctuary (<i>mimmiqdashi</i>) but rather \"Begin from my sanctified ones (<i>mimquddashai</i>). That is why it is written: \"So they began with the elders who were in front of the House\"\". And it is written: \"And He said to them, “Defile the House and fill the courts with the slain. Then go forth.” So they went forth and began to kill in the city (Ezekiel 9:7)\". And it is written: \"When they were out killing, and I remained alone, I flung myself on my face and cried out “Ah, Lord God! Are you going to annihilate all that is left of Israel (Ezekiel 9:8)\". There was no remnant except the righteous, and he came and said: \"<b>The Lord has laid waste without pity</b> (Lamentations 2:2)\".",
                "3": "\"<b>The Lord has laid waste without pity all the habitations of Jacob</b> (Lamentations 2:2)\": Rabbi Pinchas in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya said: \"There were 480 synagogues in Jerusalem, which is the numerical value of \"That was filled (<i>mel'eati</i>) with justice (Isaiah 1:21)\": <i>meleti</i> is written without an alef, and in everyone there was a Beit Sefer and a Beit Midrash, the Beit Sefer for reading scripture and the Beir Midrash for studying Mishnah. Another interpretation: \"<b>The Lord has laid waste without pity all the habitations (<i>ne'ot</i>) of Jacob</b>\": The important ones (<i>neotayv</i>) of Jacob.",
                "4": "\"<b> He has razed in His anger the daughter of  Judah’s strongholds</b> (Lamentations 2:2)\": Rabbi Yudan said: \"Every strongholdl and stronghold of Jerusalem did not appear to be conquered except in 40 days\". Rabbi Pinchas said: \"Except in 50 days and their sins were added \"<b> He has razed in His anger the daughter of  Judah’s strongholds; He has brought low in dishonor</b>\". \"<b>In dishonor the kingdom and its leaders</b>\": \"<b>In dishonor the kingdom (<i>mamlakhah</i>)</b>\": This is Israel, and this verse supports it: \"But you shall be to Me a kingdom (<i>mamlakhah</i>) of priests and a holy nation (Exodus 19:6)\". \"<b>And its leaders</b>\": These are the princes of above. You brought forth to where the enemies did not come. Jeremiah says to them: \"Make repentance and you will not go into exile\" and they said to him: \"If the enemies come what can they do to us?\" One person said: \"I would encircle the it with a wall of water\". Another said: \"I would encircle it with a wall of fire\". Another said: \"I would encircle it with a wall of iron\". The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: \"Do you feel strong because of what is mine?\" The Holy One, blessed be He, stood and changed the names of the angels: the one who controlled the water was over fire, the one over fire to iron and those below called on their names and they did not answer them. See! It is written: \"So I profaned the holy princes (Isaiah 43:28)\", and when their sins were added and the enemies came they started to call on some angel: \"One who controls such element, come to us, so and so\" and the angel replied to them: \"No because I am taken away from that field of control\". Another interpretation: \"<b>In dishonor the kingdom and its leaders</b>\": \"<b>In dishonor the kingdom</b>\": This is Zedekiah king of Judah\". \"<b>And its leaders</b>\": These are the princes above....",
                "5": "\"<b>In blazing anger He has cut down All the might (<i>qeren</i>) of Israel</b> (Lamentations 2:3)\". There are ten horns/mights: the horn of Abraham, the horn of Isaac, the horn of Joseph, the horn of Moses, the horn of Torah, the horn of priesthood, the horn of the Levites, the horn of prophecy, the horn of the Temple, the horn of Israel. There are those who say: \"The horn of the Messiah\". The horn of Abraham, as it is said: \"My beloved had a vineyard On a fruitful (<i>qeren</i>) hill (Isaiah 5:1)\". The horn of Isaac, as it is said: \"Caught in the thicket by its horns (Genesis 22:13)\". The horn of Joseph, as it is said: \"He has horns like the horns of the wild-ox (Deuteronomy 33:17)\". The horn of Moses, as it is written: \"The skin of his face had horns (beams) of light (Exodus 34:29)\". The horn of Torah, as it is written: \"It is a brilliant light Which gives off rays (horns) on every side (Habbakuk 3:4)\". The horn of the priesthood, as it is written: \"His horn is exalted in honor (Psalms 112:9)\". The horn of the Levites, as it is said: \"All these were sons of Heman, the seer of the king, [who uttered] prophecies of God for His greater glory (<i>qaren</i>) (1 Chronicles 25:5)\". The horn of prophecy, as it is said: \"My heart (<i>qarni</i>) exults in Hashem (1 Samuel 2:1)\". The horn of the Temple, as it is written: \"From the horns of wild oxen rescue me (Psalms 22:22)\". The horn of Israel, as it is said: \"He has exalted the horn of His people (Psalms 148:14)\". And there are those who say: \"The horn of the Messiah\", as it is said: \"He will give power to His king, and triumph(<i>qeren</i>) to His anointed one (1 Samuel 2:10)\". And all of these were placed on the heads of Israel and when they sinned, they fell off of them. See! it is written: \"<b>In blazing anger He has cut down All the might (<i>qeren</i>) of Israel</b>\". And they were given to the nations of the world. See! It is written: \"And of the ten horns on its head; and of the new one that sprouted, to make room for which three fell (Daniel 7:20)\". And it is written: \"And the ten horns [mean]—from that kingdom, ten kings will arise, and after them another will arise. He will be different from the former ones, and will bring low three kings (Daniel 7:24)\". And when Israel makes repentance, the Holy One, blessed be He, will restore them to their place. See! It is written: \"All the horns of the wicked I will cut; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up (Psalms 75:11)\". The horns which the righteous one of the world cut off. How will he restore them to their place? When the Holy One, blessed be He, will raise up the horn of his Messiah, as it is written: \"He will give power to His king, and triumph(<i>qeren</i>) to His anointed one (1 Samuel 2:10)\". \"<b>He has withdrawn His right hand in the presence of the foe</b>\": Rabbi Azariah in the name of Rabbi Yehudah son of Rabbi Simon said: \"When their sins add up and the enemies are gathered to Jerusalem, the mighty men of Israel shall fall and their hands will be bound behind their backs. The Holy One, blessed be He said: \"I will be with him in distress (Psalms 91:15)\", I wrote in the Torah and now my sons are upset and I am calm, perhaps \"<b>He has withdrawn His right hand</b>\" and at the end he revealed to Daniel. See! It is written: \"But you, go on to the end (Daniel 12:13)\". He said to him: \"To give judgment and reckoning\". The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: \"And you shall rest\". He said to him: \"To rest forever\"? And he said to him: \"And you will stand\". And he said to him: \"With whom? With the righteous or with the wicked?\". And he said to him: \"According to your lot, with the righteous\". He said to him: \"At the end of days (<i>yamim</i>) or the end of the right hand (<i>yamin</i>)?\" He said to him: \"At the end of <i>yamin</i> [\"days\" in Aramaic but \"right hand\" in Hebrew]. That right hand is that which was enslaved, and I have set an end for my right hand. And I redeemed my children, I redeemed my right hand, and so David said: \"That those whom You love might be rescued, deliver with Your right hand and answer me (Psalms 60:7)\". ",
                "6": "\"<b>He has ravaged Jacob like flaming fire, consuming on all sides</b> (Lamentations 2:3)\": Rabbi Shimon son of Lakish said: \"When the punishment comes, it is not for the world but rather for Jacob. What proves this? \"<b>He has ravaged Jacob like flaming fire</b>\". And when good comes, it is not for the world but rather for Jacob. See! It is written: \"Let Jacob shout out, let Israel rejoice (Psalms 14:7)\"",
                "7": "\"<b>The Lord has acted like a foe</b> (Lamentations 2:4)\": Rabbi Ayyvu said: \"These did not go to the limit of the measure of justice, so the measure of justice did not go to the limit after them. They did not go to the limit of the measure of justice, as it is written: \"And the people were like murmurers (Numbers 11:1)\": \"murmurers\" is not written but rather \"like murmurers\". They were \"The officers of Judah have acted like shifters of field boundaries (Hosea 5:10)\": \"shifters\" is not written but rather \"like shifters\". \"Ah, Israel has balked Like a stubborn cow (Hosea 4:16)\": \"a stubborn cow\" is not written but rather \"like a stubborn cow\". So the measure of justice did not go to the limit after them, as it is written: \"<b>The Lord has acted like a foe</b>\": \"The Lord was a foe\" is not written but rather \"<b>like a foe</b>\"\". Another interpretation: \"<b>The Lord has acted like a foe</b>\": This is Pharaoh, as it is said: \"The foe said (Exodus 15:9)\". \"<b>Poised His right hand like a foe</b>\": This is Haman, as it is said: \"“The adversary and enemy,” replied Esther, “is this evil Haman!” (Esther 7:6)\". Another interpretation: \"<b>The Lord has acted like a foe</b>\": This is Esau, as it is written: \"Because the enemy gloated over you, “Aha!\" (Ezekiel 36:2)\". \"<b>He slew all who delighted the eye</b>\": Rabbi Tanchum son of Jeremiah said: \"These are children who are the beloved of their fathers like the pupil of their eye\". The Rabbis say: \"These are the Sanhedrin which was beloved to Israel like the pupil of an eye\". “<b>In the tent of the daughter of Zion, He has poured out His fury, which is like fire</b> (Lamentations 2:4)\": There are four ‘pouring out’ for good and four ‘pouring out’ for evil. The four for good: “And I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplications. (Zechariah 12:10)\", “And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh (Joel 3:1)\", “And even upon the slaves and the maidservants in those days will I pour out My spirit (Joel 3:2)\", “And I shall no longer hide My face from them, for I shall have poured out My spirit upon the House of Israel (Ezekiel 39:29)\".

And he said to him: \"I swear\". And by what did he swear? Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Chanina said: \"By the inner altar\". And there were five kings that came in and reproached Nebuchadnezzar before Zedekiah and they said to him: \"The kingdom is not suited to you but rather to you since you are from the seed of David\". Then he reproached Nebuchadnezzar and said: \"I saw him skinning the flesh of a rabbit and eating it\". They went from his and they said to the king: \"That Jew goes and comes before you and he said to the five of us to Nebuchadnezzar \"I saw him skinning the flesh of a rabbit and eating it\". See! This is according to what is written: \"And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon (2 Kings 24:20)\". From then he came and he dwelled in Daphne of Antioch and the Great Sanhedrin came out to meet him, and when he saw them, that they all were attractive people, he decreed and brought to them grand chairs (<i>cathedrae</i>) and he set them in them and he said to them: \"Expound the Torah\". And then they read portion after portion and were translating it before him and when they reached the portion about vows, \"If a man makes a vow (Numbers 30:3)\" he said to them: \"If he wishes to go back on that vow is he able to or not?\" And they said to him: \"He should go before a wise man and he will release him from his vow\".

Three kinds of tears are evil: tears of smoke, tears of weeping, and tears from the bathroom, and tears over an adult child are the worst of all.

Another interpretation: \"<b>What can I take as witness</b>\": Rabbi Yonatan said: \"How many chances to conquer others did I give to you?

The cities of the nations they speak in praise of themselves. See! It is written: \"O Tyre, you boasted, I am perfect in beauty (Ezekiel 27:3)\", but Jerusalem later they spoke in praise of them. See! It is written: \"<b>Is this the city that was called perfect in beauty, joy of all the Earth?</b>\". Rabbi Nathan said: \"A merchant went to sell wool but he fell asleep and did not make a sale and he said: \"<b>Is this the city that was called perfect in beauty, joy of all the Earth?</b>\", and he then made a sale and he said: \"Truly they said \"<b>joy of all the Earth</b>\"\".",

Rabbi Berechyah in the name of Rabbi Chelbo said: \"As much as saying something\". And the Rabbis say: \"In the sparkling of an eye\". And Samuel said: \"1/56,548 of a <i>sha'ah</i>, this is a <i>reg'a</i>\". Rabbi Nathan said: \"There are three watches in the night\". Rabbi Zerika and Rabbi Amei in the name of Rabbi Shimon son of Lakish said: \"A certain thing is written: \"I arise at midnight to praise You for Your just rules (Psalm 119:62\", and a certain thing is also written: \"My eyes greet each watch of the night, as I meditate on Your promise (Psalm 119:148)\". How do these two statements stand? Rabbi Chizkiyah and others who say that and Rabbi Zerika and Rabbi Amei. One said: \"It is proven through Rabbi\". Another said: \"It is proven by Rabbi Nathan. How does proof come from Rabbi? That is self-evident. How does proof come from Rabbi Nathan? \"At the beginning of the middle watch (Judges 7:9)\". And Rabbi Nathan, how does he explain \"at midnight\"? With \"My eyes greet each watch of the night\". And why did he do that? At the time when David ate his meal, it was until the night hour and he went to bed until the beginning of the watch and he got up, and roused himself, and studied Torah, and when David ate a meal of kings, he ate until evening and he woke up at midnight and roused himself and studied Torah and on his bed, given both of these situations he was never sleeping at dawn, and David himself said: \"Awake, O my soul! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will wake the dawn (Psalm 57:9)\", that is to say wake up my glory before the glory of my Make, my glory is entirely lesser than the glory of my Maker. \"I will wake the dawn\": I will rouse the dawn and the dawn will not rouse me. Rabbi Pinchas said in the name of Rabbi Eleazar son of Menachem: \"What would David do? He would take up a harp and lyre and put them by his head [before he went to sleep], then at midnight he would get up and play them\". Rabbi Levi said: \"The harp was suspended over the bed of David and when it was midnight, the wind from the north would hit it and it would play by itself. See! It is written: \"As the musician played (1 Kings 3:15)\": \"and as he played on the instrument (<i>bamenaggen</i>)\" is not written but rather \"as the instrument played (<i>hamenaggen</i>)\", and when David heard its sound he stood up and studied the Torah, and when Israel heard the music, they would say, “Well, if King David is engaged in Torah study [at this this hour], then we should be all the more so!”. From this they studied the Torah. And how does Rabbi explain the verse of Rabbi Nathan? Rabbi Huna said: \"The end of the second and the beginning of the third which divide the night\". Rabbi Manei said to him: \"If it was referring to the middle ones you would be correct, but see, it does not refer to that but rather to the middle watch\".

When they surrounded the citadel of Jerusalem, she slaughtered him with her own hand and ate him. And it is over her that Jeremiah keens  \"<b>Shall women eat their fruit, their fondled ones</b>?

And they brought their camel into the theater and put dresses on them and they said, one to another: \"Why is it mourning?\" and they said: \"The Jews are observing the Sabbatical Year and they do not have vegetables and they are eating the thorns of this one and he is mourning over them\". And they brought a mime actor into their theater and his head was shaved and they said, one to another: \"Why is his head shaved?\" and he said: \"The Jews are keeping their Sabbaths and all which they get for all the days they eat on Shabbat but they have no wood to cook it and they broke their beds and cooked with them and they sleep on the earth and they make themselves dusty with dirt and they annoint themselves with oil and so the oil is expensive\". Another interpretation: \"Those who sit in the gate talk about me\": This is Israel who sits in the synagogues and the Beitei Midrash. \"I am the taunt of drunkards\": And after they sat and ate and drank and got drunk on the meal of Tisha b'Av they sat and read elegies and mourning songs in Lamentations. \"<b>He has filled me with bitterness</b> (Lamentations 3:15)\": This is the first festival day of Passover, as it is written about it: \"With unleavened bread and bitter herbs (Numbers 9:11)\". \"<b>Sated me with wormwood</b>\": Witch what he satisfied me on the first night of Passover, he \"<b>sated</b>\" me on the night of the fast of Tisha b'Av: the night of the first day of Passover is the night of Tisha b'Av.

Three days later they placed him in the casket and they sought to honor him because of the glory of his father and he did not allow them. He said to them: \"Allow it and I will speak over my son, and he began his sermon and said: \"I did not pay heed to my teachers, Or incline my ear to my instructors. Soon I was in dire trouble amidst the assembled congregation (Proverbs 5:13-14)\". And his mother called out over him: \"A stupid son is vexation for his father And a heartache for the woman who bore him (Proverbs 17:25)\". His sister called out over him: \"Bread gained by fraud may be tasty to a man, But later his mouth will be filled with gravel (Proverbs 20:17)\". And it was taught: \"In any meal that is eaten due to the fast of the Ninth of Av, it is prohibited to eat meat; and it is prohibited to drink wine; and it is likewise prohibited to bathe in anticipation of the fast. However, in any meal that is not due to the Ninth of Av, i.e., one is eating the meal in order that he shouldn’t be hungry on the Ninth of Av, it is permitted to eat meat and to drink wine and two dishes. Rab when he ate over all his food he placed a bit of ash and he said about it: \"This is the meal of Tisha b'Av, to fulfill what is said: \"<b>He has broken my teeth on gravel, has ground me into the dust</b>\". \"<b>My life was bereft of peace, I forgot what happiness was</b> (Lamentatation 3:17)\": Rabbi Eleazar son of Rabbi Jose in the name of Rabbi Chananya son of Rabbi Abbahu said: \"There is a story about a certain woman in Caesarea and she brought her son to a certain bakery and said to him: \"Teach my son this trade.\" He said to her: \"Leave him in my care for five years and I will teach him 500 kinds of bread. How many kinds of bread are there? Rabbi Acha said: \"With this kind of wheat there is no kinds of bread\". And the Rabbis said: \"500 kinds of bread based on the numerical value of the word kinds (<i>minnit</i>)\". Rabbi Chanina and Rabbi Yonatan were were studying and they thought up for them 60 and then they stopped. And further, Rabbi Eleazar son of Rabbi Jose said: \"There is a story about a certain woman who brought her son to a chef and she said to him: \"Teach my son this trade\". He said to her \"Leave him in my care for five years and I will teach him 100 things to do with an egg\". Rabbi heard and said: \"I have not seen that there is \"<b>happiness</b>\" in the world\". Rabbi Shimon son of Chalafta heard and he said: \"We have not heard there is \"<b>happiness</b>\" in the world\". Rabbi Yehudah son of Beteira went to Nisibis on the eve of the great fast and he ate and finished and the exilarch heard and come to invite him and he said to him: \"Come over to my house Rabbi\". And he said to him: \"I have eaten and finished\". And he said to him \"Come over to my house Rabbi, so they will not say that he did not think anything of me at all\", so he went to him. When he came he said to the maitre d': \"Now, the courses which you bring to us, one time serve them and do not repeat them for a second time\". While they were eating they brought and served 80 courses and he ate from each course a little bit and drank from each wine jar a little bit, and he said to him: \"Rabbi, after you ate and finished you have come back and tasted each course, from each course you ate and from each wine jar you drank\". And he said: \"Why do we say that appetite is a \"life\" (<i>nafsh</i>)? Because more and more it goes and grows (<i>nefishah</i>)\". Rabbi Abbah went to Bozrah and was received by Jose the head, and they served him 80 kinds of birds' heads and he said to him: \"Do not be upset, Rabbi, but there was not enough birds\" and do they not call him Jose the head for anything but that his food was nothing but birds' heads? Rabbi Chiyya the elder went to Rome and he was received by Rabbi Yehoshua son of Levi and they went and served him 24 dishes. He said to him: \"On Shabbat what are you going to do?\". He said: \"We double them\". Some days later Rabbi Yehoshua son of Levi went to Tiberias and was received by Rabbi Chiyya the elder and he gave to the students of Rabbi Yehoshua money and said to them, buy and do according to the custom of your master\". Rabbi Yitzchak son of Rabbi Eleazer was one who knew the order to the meals according to the counting of days. So it was when he had money, and when he did not have it he took pits and counted them so he would not forget. \"<b> I forgot what happiness was</b>\": Rabbi Shimon son of Gamliel said: \"This is washing the hands and feet after they have been washed\". \"<b>I thought my strength and hope Had perished before Hashem</b> (Lamentations 3:18)\": Rabbi Shimon son of Lakish said: \"When the Holy One, blessed be He, withdraws from the righteous in this world he changes his mind and is merciful on them.

                "6": "\"<b>To recall my distress and my rebellion was wormwood and poison</b> (Lamentations 3:19)\": The Assembly of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: \"Master of the universe, <b>recall</b> the <b>distress</b> which I distressed you and my <b>rebellion</b> which I rebelled against you and let them remove one another, the <b>wormwood and poision</b>\" one will release the other\". \"<b>Whenever I thought of them</b> (Lamentations 3:20\": Rabbi Chiyya taught: \"There is a parable of a king who went out to war and his sons were with him and they annoyed him. Later the king went out by himself and his sons were not with him. The king said: \"My sons were not with me although they annoy me\". So as to the king, this is the Holy One, blessed be He, and as to his sons, this is Israel. When Israel went out to war, the Holy One, blessed be He, went out with them and when they provoked him he did not go out with them and when Israel was not in the land, He said: \"Israel was not with me although they provoke me, and so it is in three verses: \"Oh, to be in the desert, at an encampment for wayfarers! Oh, to leave my people (Jeremiah 9:1)\": My people like they were when they were in the desert. And it is written: \"O mortal, when the House of Israel dwelt on their own soil, they defiled it with their ways and their deeds (Ezekiel 36:17)\" and here \"<b>Whenever I thought of them, I was bowed low</b>\". Rabbi Yudan said: \"\"<b>Whenever I thought of them</b>\": I know that you remember the nations of the world, but what will I do \"<b>I was bowed low</b>\". So it is said: \"The fat becomes small and the small one dies\". \"<b>But this do I call to mind, therefore I have hope</b> (Lamentations 3:21)\": Rabbi Abba son of Kahana in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: \"What parable is this thing like? To a king who married a wife and wrote a grand ketubah for her, and he said to her: \"So I am making huppahs for you and so I am giving expensive clothes to you\". The king left her and went to the sea province and beyond. And those who lived near her came and harassed her and said to her: \"The king has abandoned you and gone to the province of the sea and he is not going to return back to you\". She was weeping and sighing and when she went to the middle of her house and opened and brought out her ketubah and read it and she saw in the ketubah \"So I am making huppahs for you and so I am giving expensive clothes to you\", because of this she was comforted. After many days the king came and said to her: \"My daughter I am shocked. How have you stayed by me all these years?\" She said to him: \"My lord king, if not for the grad ketubah that you wrote and gave to mu, long ago the neighbors would have made me leave\". So the idolaters harass Israel and they say to them: \"You God hid his face from you and has removed his shekhinah from you and he is not going to return to you, and they weep and sigh and when they gather at synagogues at house of study and read in the Torah: \"I will look with favor upon you, and make you fertile and multiply you; I will establish My abode in your midst, and I will not spurn you, I will be ever present in your midst (Leviticus 26:9, 11, 12)\" then they are comforted. \"Tomorrow the end of the exile will come\" the Holy One, blessed be He, says to them \"My sons I am shocked, how have you stayed by me all these years?\" And they say before him: \"Master of the universe, if not for your Torah which you gave us, the nations would have made us leave\". And so it is said: \"<b>But this do I call to mind, Therefore I have hope</b>\". And this is nothing else than the Torah, as it is said: \"And this is the Torah (Deuteronomy 4:44)\". And so David said: \"Were not Your teaching my delight I would have perished in my affliction (Psalm 119:92)\". \"<b>Therefore I have hope</b>\": and they unify his name twice a day and say: \"Hear O Israel, Hashem is your God, Hashem is one (Deuteronomy 6:4)\".\n"

He said to him: \"Do not shame me and I will return do you double of what I eat\". He said to him: \"You must not recline\". He said to him: \"Do not shame me and I will return the cost of this entire banquet\". He said to him: \"Get up and go!\" Rabbi Zechariah son of Eukolos was there and it was in his hand to stop it and he did not stop it. He left from there and said to himself: \"They are reclining and feasting extravagantly and I am going to go and press charges against them. What did he do? He went to the magistrate and said to him: \"Those sacrifices which you send to the Jews to sacrifice, they eat them and they offer other ones, exchanging them\". He did not care.

Rabbi Yehoshua went and stood by the entrance to the prison. He said, as if speaking to himself: “Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? (Isaiah 42:24)\". That child answered by reciting the continuation of the verse: “Did not the Lord, He against Whom we have sinned, and in Whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient to His law?” When Rabbi Yehoshua heard that he called to him: \"<b>The precious children of Zion, once valued as gold</b> (Lamentations 4:2)\".

They said that he did not move from there until he ransomed him for a great sum of money, and not even a few days had passed when this child then issued halakhic rulings in Israel. And who was this child? This was Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha. Another interpretation: Why were they precious?

Another interpretation: Why were they precious? Because not one of them claimed a claim in vain. Rabbi Shimon son of Gamliel says: \"A great custom that was followed in Jerusalem was that when one made a feast, there would be a cloth [mappa] spread over the entrance to the hall. As long as the cloth was spread, the guests would enter, as the presence of the cloth indicated that there was food for more guests. When the cloth was removed, the guests would not enter any more\". Another interpretation: Why were they precious? They entrusted the banquet to a caterer, and if something in the banquet went wrong, they blamed it all on the caterer, in line with the deference for the master of the house and the deference of the guests. Another interpretation: Why were they precious? At that time, when one of them made a banquet he listed all the courses of the banquet on a menu. Why so? So that someone did not eat something that was bad for them.

They are David, Asa, Jehosaphat and Hezekiah. Regarding David it says “I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them” (Psalms 18:38). The Holy One said to him: I will do so. This is what is written “And David smote them from evening until evening to their morrow” (Samuel I 30:17) What does ‘to their morrow’ mean? R’ Yehoshua son of Levi said: for two nights and one day. The Holy One lit up the night for him with shooting stars and lightning, as it is taught (Mishna Berachot 2:9) ‘on shooting stars, on earthquakes and on lightning.’ This is what is written “For You light my lamp” (Psalms 18:29). Asa stood up and said: I do not have the strength to kill them, rather I will pursue them and You do the rest. This is what is written “And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them… for they were broken before the Lord and before His camp, and they carried away very much spoils.” (Chronicles II 14:12) It is not written ‘before Asa’ but rather ‘before the Lord and before His camp.’ Jehosaphat stood up and said: I have no strength to kill or to pursue, rather I will sing a song and You do the rest. The Holy One said to him: I will do so, as it says “And at the time they commenced with song and praise…” (Chronicles II 20:22) Hezekiah stood up and said: I have no strength to kill, or to pursue or to sing a song, rather I will sleep on my bed and You do the rest. The Holy One said to him: I will do so, as it says “And it came to pass on that night that an angel of the Lord went out and slew one hundred eighty-five thousand of the camp of Assyria” (Kings II 19:35). How many remained from them? Rab said: \"Ten, as it is said: \"Shall be so few that a boy may record them (Isaiah 10:19)\" and the way of a child is to be able to write a yod [which represents the number 10]\". Rabbi Eliezer says: \"Six, because the way of a child is to be able to write a straight stroke [for vav which represents the number 6]\". Rabbi Yehoshua says: \"Five, as it is said: \"Two berries or three on the topmost branch (Isaiah 17:6)\"\". Rabbi Yehudah son of Rabbi Simon said: \"Nine. See! It is written: \"Two berries or three on the topmost branch, four or five on the boughs of the crown (Isaiah 17:6)\"\". Between the opinions of these men and between the opinions of those men everyone agrees that Nebuchadnezzar was one of them. When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: \"Ascend and destroy the Temple\", he said \"He does not want that but rather he is trapping me doing to me as he did to my father\". What did he do? He went and stayed in Daphne of Antioch and he sent Nebuzaradan, the leader of the guards to destroy Jerusalem. He was besieging it for three years and every day he attacked Jerusalem and he was not able to capture it and when he was not able to capture it and he was seeking to go away, the Holy One, blessed be He, placed it in his heart to start measuring the wall which was sinking every day by <i>tefachim</i> and he stayed until the whole thing sank and when it all sank the enemies entered Jerusalem. About this time it says: \"<b>The kings of the earth did not believe, nor any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or adversary could enter The gates of Jerusalem</b>\".",
                "15": "\"<b>It was for the sins of her prophets</b> (Lamentations 4:13)\": Rabbi Yudan asked Rabbi Acha: \"Where did they kill Zechariah in the Court of Israel or the Court of the Women\"? He said to him: \"Not in the Court of Israel or the in the Court of Women but rather in the Court of the Priests, and they did not treat his blood either like the blood of a deer and not like the blood of a goat, so it is written: \"And if any Israelite or any stranger who resides among them hunts down an animal or a bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth (Leviticus 17:13)\" but in the above case it is thus written: \"For the blood she shed is still in her; She set it upon a bare rock; She did not pour it out on the ground To cover it with earth (Ezekiel 24:7)\". And why did they do that? \"She set her blood upon the bare rock, So that it was not covered, So that it may stir up [My] fury To take vengeance (Ezekiel 24:8)\". Seven transgressions did Israel commit on that day: they killed a priest, and a prophet, and a judge, and they poured out innocent blood, and they profaned the Name, and they defiled the Temple court, and it was a Shabbat and Yom Kipput. And when Nebuzaradan came up he saw the blood of Zechariah was dripping and he said to them: \"What is this?\" They said to him: \"The blood of bulls and sheep\". He brought bulls and sheep and it did not stop. He brought animals of every species and the blood did not stop. He said to them: \"Tell me the truth, if you do not I will tear apart your flesh by raking it with combs of iron\" and they did not speak to him. And he spoke to them again and they said to him: \"What can we say? He was a prophet and a priest for us and he reproached us in the name of Heaven and we did not receive his instruction but we got together and killed him\". He said to them: \"I will make peace for him\". He brought the Great Sanhedrin and killed them but the blood did not rest. He killed the Lesser Sanhedrin and the blood did not rest. He brought the flower of the priesthood and killed them but it did not rest. He killed the children of the Great House and it did not rest. Finally he bowed and said to him: \"Zechariah, the good things of you people I destroyed for your sake; will I destroy all of them to stop your blood?\" The evil Nebuzaradan considered repentance and said: \"All this for one soul of Israel who was killed about whom it was written: \"Whoever sheds the blood of man, By man shall his blood be shed (Genesis 9:6)\". So for many souls how much more!\" Because of this the Holy One, blessed be He, was filled with mercy and made a secret sign to the blood and it was swallowed up in its place. At that time he said: \"<b>It was for the sins of her prophets, The iniquities of her priests, Who had shed in her midst The blood of the just</b>\".",
                "16": "\"<b>They wandered blindly through the streets</b> (Lamentations 4:14)\": The blind among them said: \"Who will reaveal to us the place where they killed Zechariah so we can go there and embrace him and kiss him, to fulfill what is written: \"<b>They wandered blindly through the streets defiled with blood</b>\". The lame among them were saying who will show us the blood of Zechariah so we can go up and wallow in it to fulfill what is said: \"<b> Defiled with blood, so that no one was able to touch their garments</b>\".",
                "17": "\"<b>“Away! Unclean!” people shouted at them</b> (Lamentations 4:15)\": Rabbi Chanina interpreted this verse as referring to the daughters of Zion. See! It is written: \"Hashem said: “Because the daughters of Zion Are so vain And walk with heads thrown back (Isaiah 3:16)\": \"Because the daughters of Zion Are so vain\": they walked about with presumptuousness of spirit. \"And walk with heads thrown back\": As was the case when one of them dressed up in ornaments, she stretched her neck here and there in her pride to show off her jewelry. \"With roving eyes\": Rabbi Asei of Caesarea said: \"They deceptively painted their eyes with red paint\". And Rabbi Shimon son of Lakish said: \"With red collyrium\". \"And with mincing gait\": If one of them was tall she went with two short women on either side, so that she might seem taller because of their height. And if one of them was short, she wore platform shoes so she might appear tall. \"Making a tinkling with their feet\": Rabbi Jose said: \"She was decorated by the form of a dragon on her sandals\". And the Rabbis said\" \"She brought the crop of a rooster and it was filled with balsam oil and she placed in between her heel and her sandal and when she saw a group of guys she smashed it and the scent spread among them and this was like the venom of a snake\". It happened that Jeremiah said to them: \"Make repentance so that the enemies will not come\". And they said to him: \"If the enemies come upon us, what are they able to do to us? See! It is written: \"Let Him speed, let Him hasten His purpose, If we are to give thought; Let the plans of the Holy One of Israel Be quickly fulfilled, If we are to give heed (Isaiah 5:19)\". A duke sees me and takes me and settles me with him on a chariot, she said to Jeremiah: \"Let it be known which will stand, our opinion of his opinion\". When their sins were tallied and their enemies came, they made themselves up and went out to them like harlots, and a duke saw one and took her and an <i>eparch</i> saw another and took her, and <i>strategos</i> saw one and took her and set her with him in his chariot. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: \"Will my opinion not stand yet theirs will?\" What did he do? \"Hashem will bare the pates Of the daughters of Zion, Hashem will uncover their heads (Isaiah 3:17)\": Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Jose the son of Rabbi Chanina: Rabbi Eleazar said: \"He struck them with <i>tzara'at</i> and see this is what is said: \"For swellings, for rashes, or for discolorations (Leviticus 14:56)\". Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Chanina said: \"He brought families on their heads, families of lice!\" And Rabbi Chiyya son of Abba said: \"He made them slaves who bore burdens\". What does \"bore burdens\" mean? Slave women. Rabbi Berechyah and Chalafi son of Zevid in the name of Rabbi Isei: \"What does \"bare\" (<i>sippach</i>) mean here? To seep with discharges (<i>shipp'a</i>), as to guard the holy seed which will not be mingled with the peoples of the land, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: \"I know that idolaters do not stay away from someone with <i>tzara'at</i>. What did he do? \"Hashem will uncover their heads (Isaiah 3:17): The Holy One, blessed be He, allegorically speaks of their internal springs and he caused blood to flow from them which filled with whole chariot, and when he saw that he pierced her with his spear and placed her in front of the chariot and he drove his chariot over her and she was torn apart, this is why Jeremiah says: \"<b>“Away! Unclean!” people shouted at them, “Away! Away! Touch not!”</b>\". \"<b>So they wandered and wandered again</b>\": Rabbi Chanina said: Israel did not go into exile until they blasphemed the Holy One, blessed be He\". And Rabbi Simon said: \"Israel did not go into exile until they made themselves fighters against the Holy One, blessed be He\".",
                "18": "\"<b>Hashem’s countenance has turned away from them</b> (Lamentations 4:16)\": from 100, 100. From 200, 200 (<i>matayim</i>). There they call a town a <i>matan</i>.",
                "19": "\"<b>Even now our eyes pine away</b> (Lamentations 4:17)\": What were the ten tribes doing? They were sending oil to Egypt and bringing grain and they sent that to Babylon so that if enemies came against them they would have an ally. See! It is written: \"Now they make a covenant with Assyria, now oil is carried to Egypt (Hosea 12:2)\". At a later time the enemies came and they sent word to Pharaoh Necho as he was traveling on the Great Sea and the Holy One, blessed be He, made a secret signal to the skeletons and they floated on the face of the water. And they spoke to each other: \"Why are the skeletons floating?\" And he said to them: \"Their fathers stood beneath your fathers and they stood up and drowned them in the sea\"&gt; They said: \"And as they have doen thus to our fathers, are we going to go and be allies to them?\" Because of this they left. See! it is written: \"The army of Pharaoh, which set out to help you, will return to its own land, to Egypt (Jeremiah 37:7)\", and thus it is written: \"<b>As we waited, still we wait for a nation that cannot help</b>\".",
                "20": "\"<b>Our steps were checked, We could not walk in our squares</b> (Lamentations 4:18)\": For 52 years Beitar existed after the destruction of the Temple, and why was it destroyed? Because they kindled lights for the destruction of the Temple. And why did they kindle them? They said: \"The city councilmen who were in Jerusalem were sitting in the center of the town, and thus someone would come from there to pray and they said to him: \"Do you want to serve as a city councilman?\" He said to them: \"No\". \"Do you want to serve as an archon?\" He said to them \"No\". They said to him \"We heard that you had an estate, do you want to sell it?\" He said to them: \"I did not think about that\". And they wrote and sent a document to the overseer of his house that \"So-and-so should not be able to set foot on the estate because he sold it to me\". And that man said: \"If only he had broken his foot and he had not gone there!\" So it is written: \"<b>Our steps were checked</b>\": their steps were prevented from walking in the colonnades. \"<b> Our end is near</b>\": the end of the Temple. \"<b>Our days are </b>\": the day of the Temple. But it was not good for them, as it is written: \"He who rejoices over another’s misfortune will not go unpunished (Proverbs 17:5)\".",
                "21": "\"<b>Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles in the sky</b> (Lamentations 4:19)\": The Emperor Trajan, may his bones rot!, his wife gave birth on the night of Tisha b'Av and all Israel was in mourning. The child was silenced on Chanukah; Israel said: \"Should we light candles or not light?\" They said: \"We should light and all what will happen will happen because of it\". The candles were lit and they went and spoke about it slanderously to the wife of Trajan: \"Those Jews when you gave birth they mourned and when your child died they lit their lamps!\". She sent and wrote to her husband, why are you attacking the barbarians? Come and attack these Jews who rebelled against you!\" He went and reckoned that the trip would be a five day journey and the wind brought him in five days and he came and they were focused on this verse: \"Hashem will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, which will swoop down like the eagle (Deuteronomy 28:49)\". He said to them: \"I am the eagle who calculated I would come in ten days but the wind brought me in five days\". He besieged them with his legions and killed them. He said to the women: \"Obey my legions and if not I will treat you in the way in which I treated the men\". They said: \"Do to us what you did to the men\", and so he besieged them with his legions and killed them. And their blood was mixed up with the blood of them, and the blood broke forth and went until it reached the river of Cyprus. \"<b>They chased us (<i>delaqunu</i>) in the mountains</b>\": Rabbi Ayyvu said: \"They set fires (<i>dolqin</i>) behind their siege engines\". Rabbi Yaakov of Kfar Chanin said: \"They shot fire arrows at Jerusalem\". And the Rabbis say: \"They were pursuers (<i>dolqeihen</i>) of Israel, and thus it says: \"<b>They chased us in the mountains</b>\".",
                "22": "\"<b>The breath of our life, Hashem's anointed</b> (Lamentations 4:20)\": Rabbi and Rabbi Ishmael son of Rabbi Jose were sitting and studying in the megillah of Lamentations on the evening of Tisha B'Av and it happened to be on Shabbat, and they left out on chapter of the alphabetic acrostics, and they said: \"We will go and finish it tomorrow\". When Rabbi was going up to his house he stubbed his thumb and he said over himself: \"Many are the torments of the wicked (Psalm 32:10)\". Rabbi Ishmael son of Rabbi Jose said to him: \"We were focused on this task and this happened to you, so I should have said this, and now how much more should I: \"<b>The breath of our life, Hashem's anointed</b>\". When Rabbi went up to his house he placed on the wound a dry sponge and bound around it grass from outside. Rabbi Ishmael the son of Rabbi Jose said: \"From him we learned three things: a dry sponge does not heal but rather it guards a wound, grass from the house is usable, and they do not read verses from the Writings unless after Minchah and in the time approaching evening, but they can study them and expound on them, and if they need to examine and to read them, they bring them and read them\". Samuel said: \"A piece of pottery\". Rabbi Zeira in the name of Rabbi Samuel said: \"A clay lid and baked clay, it is permitted to handle on Shabbat, and that thrown in the trash, it is forbidden to handle on Shabbat. \"He who trusts in Hashem he is surrounded by lovingkindness (Psalms 21:10)\": Rabbi Eleazar of Bozrah and Rabbi Tanchum in the name of Rabbi Acha said: \"If even an evil man, the Holy One, blessed be He, turns to him and receives him, as it is said: \"He who trusts in Hashem he is surrounded by lovingkindness.",
                "23": "\"<b>Rejoice and exult, daughter of Edom</b> (Lamentations 4:21)\": This is Caesarea. \"<b>Who dwell in the land of Uz!</b>\": This is Persia. \"<b>To you, too, the cup shall pass, You shall get drunk and expose your nakedness</b>\".",
                "24": "\"<b>Your iniquity, daughter of Zion, is expiated</b> (Lamentation 4:22)\": Rabbi Chelbo in the name of Rabbi Yochanan said: \"Better was the removal of the ring of pharaoh in Egypt than the forty years when Moses prophesied over them because that oppression was redemption but this oppression was not redemption\". Rabbi Shimon son of Lakish said: \"Better was the removal of the ring of Achashverosh over Israel in Medea than the 60,000 prophets who prophesied in the days of Elijah. Why? Because that oppression was redemption but this oppression was not redemption\". The Rabbis say: \"Better was the megillah of Lamentations than the forty years when Jeremiah prophesied over them. Why? Because Israel made full reparations for their sins on the day the Temple was destroyed. See! It is written: \"<b>Your iniquity, daughter of Zion, is expiated</b>\". \"<b>Your iniquity, daughter of Edom, He will note</b>\": This was written to fulfill what was said: \"Hashem will ward off from you all sickness; He will not bring upon you any of the dreadful diseases of Egypt, about which you know, but will inflict them upon all your enemies (Deuteronomy 7:5)\": Rabbi Pinchas in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya said: \"Why were the corrections created? To fall upon the house where they were meant. See! It is written: \"But will inflict them upon all your enemies\". And further it is written: \"The prophecy of Obadiah. We have received tidings from Hashem...“Up! Let us rise up against her for battle.” Thus said my Lord GOD concerning Edom (Obadiah 1:1)\" and then this verse is written: \"<b>Your iniquity, daughter of Zion, is expiated; He will exile you no longer</b>\".

Rabbi Berachia said: Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Master of the World, doesn't it say in your Torah, (Deuteronomy 25:17) 'Remember what Amalek did to you...'? He did it to us, but not to You? Didn't he destroy Your Temple? The Rabbanan said: Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, we are Yours and the nations of the world are Yours, why don't You have mercy on Your nation? \"And the king against whom there is no rising up\" (Proverbs 30:31): Rabbi Yitzchak said: Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Forgetfulness is among us, but it is not among You, nor before You. Therefore, remember! (Psalms 137:7) \"Remember, God, the people of Edom on the day of Jerusalem; who said, \"Aru, Aru\", even to the foundation thereof.\" Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: [\"Aru, Aru\" means] \"Destroy, Destroy\". And Rabbi Levi said: [\"Aru, Aru\" means] \"Raze, Raze\". the one who says, \"Destroy, Destroy\" uses the verse (Jeremiah 51:58) \"Babylon's thick walls will be \"Ar'er tit'ar'er\" - \"totally demolished\"\". The one who said \"Raze, Raze\" uses the verse (Psalms 137:7) \"even the foundations thereof\", even to it's bottommost foundations. \"Look, see our shame\" (Lamentations 5:1) - Rabbi Yudan said: Looking is up close, seeing is from afar. \"Looking is up close\", as is written, (I Kings 19:6) \"And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake cooked on hot coals...\" \"Seeing is from afar\", as is written, (Genesis 22:4) \"And he saw the place from afar.\" Rabbi Pinchas said: Looking is from afar, as is written, (Psalms 80:14), \"Look from the heavens and see.\" Seeing is up close, as is written, (Genesis 32:26), \"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh.\"",
                "1": "\"<b>Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers...</b>\"(Lamentations 5:2) - What kind of \"turning over\"? Like the turning over of Sodom. Jeremiah called it: \"Our inheritance.\" Isaiah called it: (Isaiah 64:10)\"Our holy and beautiful house.\" Asaf came and said: It is not \"our inheritance\", nor \"our holy and beautiful house\", but \"the nations invade what is Yours\". That is what is written: (Psalms 79:1) \"[A psalm of Asaf:] O God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy Temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.\"",
                "2": "\"<b>We have become orphans, and fatherless...</b>\" (Lamentations 5:3) - Rabbi Berachya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: You weep and say before me, \"We have become orphans, and fatherless.\" By your lives, so will your redeemer that I will raise among you in Media, he will not have a father nor a mother. That's what is written: (Esther 2:7) \"He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother.\"",

They said, \"Woe is to us, that we have fulfilled this verse: 'We pay to drink our water, our wood comes at a price.'\" (Lamentations 5:4)",
                "4": "\"<b>Our pursuers are at our necks...</b>\" (Lamentations 5:5) - Hadrian, may his bones be crushed, decreed and said: If we come and find a Jew with hair, we will take off his head. That's what is written, \"<b>Our pursuers are at our necks</b>.\" (Lamentations 5:5). Alternatively: \"<b>Our pursuers are at our necks</b>\", for we rebelled against our necks on this day of distress [and had thrown off the yoke of Torah]. \"We have toiled and have received no rest.\" (Lamentations 5:5) - Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed, commanded Nevuzaradan and said to him: \"The god of these people accept repentant ones, and his hand extends to receive those who return [to him]. Once you have captured them, we must not allow leave for them to pray, so they won't repent for their god to have mercy on them, and they will leave with blackened faces. Don't be easy on them.\" Once he captured them, when one would stand before him, he had him sentenced to be torn limb from limb. He tore him up in front of them. They went unwillingly without [needing] shackles. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Nevuzaradan is Arioch. Why was his name Arioch? Because he would roar at the captives like a lion, until they arrived at the Euphrates. When they reached the Euphrates, he said to the soldiers: Let them rest now, for from this point on their god won't return to them. That is what is written, (Psalms 137:1) \"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, we also cried.\" Until that point, we did not sit.",

They sent oil to Egypt, brought in wheat and sent it to Assyria. For if enemies would come, they could help. That's what is written, (Hosea 12:1) \"They do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.\" [Additional version: That's what is written, (Lamentations 4:17) \"Our eyes failed, looking in vain for help...\"",
                "6": "\"<b>Our fathers sinned and are no more... [it is we who have borne their iniquities]</b>\" (Lamentations 5:7) - The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Through your [suffering] did they survive. Alternatively: [You] survive on My account.",

Alternatively: \"Servants rule over us...\" - This refers to the non-Jews. \"<b>There is none to deliver us out of their hand</b>\" - If it weren't for the Holy One, blessed be He.",
                "8": "\"<b>We get our bread [in trade] for our spirit, [because of the sword in the wilderness]</b>.\" (Lamentations 5:9) - Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said: Originally, they were short of spirit, [and] distress from the non-Jews [only] shortened it [even more]. It is written about our ancestors: (Numbers 21:4) \"The people became short of spirit on the way...\" Daniel said: (Daniel 7:15) \"I was short of spirit.\" Isaiah said: (Isaiah 21:3) \"My loins are full of distress...\" Jeremiah said: \"<b>We get bread [in trade] for our spirit</b>.\" We, who find ourselves among the non-Jews, how much more so.",
                "9": "\"<b>Our skin has become contracted (n-ch-m-r-u) like an oven('s heat), [because of the terrible famine]</b>\" (Lamentations 5:10) - 2 amoraim: One said, \"[Their skin was] like those withered fruits [ch-m-r-y-a-t-a].\" And one said, \"Like an oven that has not been kindled as much as it needed to be [and have become blackened].\"",
                "10": "\"<b>They ravished the women of Zion...</b>\" (Lamentations 5:11) - Nevuzaradan [alt. Nevuchadnezzar] commanded his troops, saying to them, \"The god of these people hates promiscuity. Be careful not to touch another man's wife.\" Once the women heard that, they came and said to a man: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothes; only let us be called by your name [so that the troops won't touch us]. That's what is written, (Isaiah 4:1) \"And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by your name, to take away our shame.\" Except 3 were lazy and did not do this, and they were ravished.

                "11": "\"<b>Princes were hanged up by their hand...</b>\" (Lamentations 5:12) - An appointed officer would enter the city, and would take the best of the city and hang them. The elderly would come and bribe them, but they wouldn't accept it from them. Therefore it says, \"<b>Princes were hanged up by their hand, the faces of elders were not honored</b>.\" (Lamentations 5:12)",
                "12": "\"<b>Young men must carry millstones</b> (Lamentations 5:13)\": It was the case that there were no millstones in Babylon and when Nebuchadnezzar came up he made them bring millstones and go down. See! It is written: \" For your sake I send to Babylon; I will bring down all bars (<i>barichim</i>) (Isaiah 43:14); it is talking about millstones (<i>barechim</i>). Another interpretation: \"<b>Young men must carry millstones</b>\": this is euphemistic. And so it said: \"and he became a mill slave in the prison (Judges 16:21)\". \"<b>And youths stagger under loads of wood</b>\": Rabbi Yehoshua son of Levi said: Three hundred young kids were found hanged on one branch\".",

Rabbi Jose the son of Rabbi Avin in the name of Rabbi Chisda said: \"At first when trouble came upon Israel they stopped their joy because of that, and when they abolished the Sanhedrin, they abolished singing from the banquet house, as it is said: \"They drink their wine without song (Isaiah 24:9)\".

Better for him to have his head cut off and not to this, as it is: \"Here is an evil I have seen under the sun as great as an error committed by a ruler (Ecclesiastes 10:5)\" and thus it was written for him: \"<b>The crown has fallen from our head; Woe to us that we have sinned!</b>\".",
                "16": "\"<b>Because of this our hearts are sick</b> (Lamentations 5:17)\": Rabbi Simlai said: \"The Holy One, blessed be He, gave great distress to this women, and after she watched for the days of her <i>niddah</i> she went and watched for the days of her <i>zivah</i>\". Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Jose the Galilean says: \"This woman because she leaves her house for two or three days thus the Torah says \"sick\". See! It is written: \"who is in menstrual infirmity (Leviticus 15:33)\". We leave the house of our life and the house of our holiness for how many days, how much more so should we be called \"sick\". Thus it is said: \"<b>Because of this our hearts are sick, because of these our eyes are dimmed</b>\". ",
                "17": "\"<b>Because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate</b> (Lamentations 5:18)\": And it once was that Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Akiva were walking along the road in the Roman Empire, and they heard the sound of the multitudes of Rome from Puteoli at a distance of one hundred and twenty mil. The city was so large that they were able to hear its tumult from a great distance. And the other Sages began weeping and Rabbi Akiva was laughing. They said to him: For what reason are you laughing? Rabbi Akiva said to them: And you, for what reason are you weeping? They said to him: These gentiles, who bow to false gods and burn incense to idols, dwell securely and tranquilly in this colossal city, and for us, the House of the footstool of our God, the Temple, is burnt by fire, and shall we not weep? Rabbi Akiva said to them: That is why I am laughing. If for those who violate His will, the wicked, it is so and they are rewarded for the few good deeds they performed, for those who perform His will, all the more so will they be rewarded. The Gemara relates another incident involving those Sages. On another occasion they were ascending to Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. When they arrived at Mount Scopus and saw the site of the Temple, they rent their garments in mourning, in keeping with halakhic practice. When they arrived at the Temple Mount, they saw a fox that emerged from the site of the Holy of Holies. They began weeping, and Rabbi Akiva was laughing. They said to him: For what reason are you laughing? Rabbi Akiva said to them: For what reason are you weeping? They said to him: This is the place concerning which it is written: “And the non-priest who approaches shall die” (Numbers 1:51), and now foxes walk in it; and shall we not weep? Rabbi Akiva said to them: That is why I am laughing, as it is written, when God revealed the future to the prophet Isaiah: “And I will take to Me faithful witnesses to attest: Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah” (Isaiah 8:2). Now what is the connection between Uriah and Zechariah? He clarifies the difficulty: Uriah prophesied during the First Temple period, and Zechariah prophesied during the Second Temple period, as he was among those who returned to Zion from Babylonia. Rather, the verse established that fulfillment of the prophecy of Zechariah is dependent on fulfillment of the prophecy of Uriah. In the prophecy of Uriah it is written: “Therefore, for your sake Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become rubble, and the Temple Mount as the high places of a forest” (Micah 3:12), where foxes are found. There is a rabbinic tradition that this was prophesied by Uriah. In the prophecy of Zechariah it is written: “There shall yet be elderly men and elderly women sitting in the streets of Jerusalem” (Zechariah 8:4). Until the prophecy of Uriah with regard to the destruction of the city was fulfilled I was afraid that the prophecy of Zechariah would not be fulfilled, as the two prophecies are linked. Now that the prophecy of Uriah was fulfilled, it is evident that the prophecy of Zechariah remains valid. The Gemara adds: The Sages said to him, employing this formulation: Akiva, you have comforted us; Akiva, you have comforted us.",

                "19": "“<b>Why do You forget us forever, forsake us so long?</b>” (Lamentations 5:20) R’ Yehoshua ben Avin said, ‘Jeremiah made four claims – abandonment, forgetting, rejection and wrath.’ Abandonment and forgetting - “<b>Why do You forget us forever, forsake us so long?</b>” Rejection and wrath – “<b>For if You have utterly rejected us, You have been exceedingly wrathful against us</b>.” (Lamentations 5:22) Rejection had already been reversed in his days, as it says “So said the Lord: If the heavens above will be measured and the foundations of the earth below will be fathomed, I too will reject…” (Jeremiah 31:36) Wrath was already reversed in the days of Isaiah, as it says “For I will not contend forever, neither will I be wrathful to eternity…” (Isaiah 57:16) Abandonment and forgetting have not been reversed, therefore Zion complains and says “But Zion said: ‘The Lord has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.’” (Isaiah 49:14) Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said ‘Jeremiah made four claims – abandonment, forgetting, rejection and despising.’ Abandonment and forgetting - “<b>Why do You forget us forever, forsake us so long?</b>” Rejection and despising – “Have You indeed rejected Judah? Has Your soul despised Zion? (Jeremiah 14:19) Rejection and despising were already reversed in the days of Moses, as it says “But despite all this, while they are in the land of their enemies, I will not despise them nor will I reject them to annihilate them…” (Leviticus 26:44) Abandonment and forgetting have not been reversed, therefore Zion complains and says “But Zion said: ‘The Lord has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.’” (Isaiah 49:14)",
                "20": "\"<b>Take us back, O Hashem, to Yourself, And let us come back</b> (Lamentations 5:21)\": The assembly of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: \"Master of the universe, it is up to you, \"<b>take us back</b>\"\". He said to them: \"It is up to you, as it is said: \"Turn back to Me, and I will turn back to you—said Hashem (Malachi 3:7)\". They said before him: \"Master of the universe, it is up to you, as it is said: \"Turn again, O God, our helper, revoke Your displeasure with us (Psalms 85:5)\" and so it is said: \"<b>Take us back, O Hashem, to Yourself, And let us come back</b>\". \"<b>Renew our days as of old!</b>\": Like Adam the first, according to what was written: \"He drove the man out, and stationed east of the garden of Eden (Genesis 3:24)\". Another interpretation: \"<b>Renew our days as of old!</b>\": According to what was written: \"Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to Hashem as in the days of yore and in the years of old (Malachi 3:4)\". \"Days of yore\": This is Moses, as it is written: \"Then they remembered the ancient days, Him, who pulled His people out (<i>mosheh</i>) (Isaiah 63:11)\". \"Years of old\": like the years of Solomon. Rabbi says: \"\"Days of yore\": like the days of Noah, as it is said: \"For this to Me is like the waters of Noah (Isaiah 54:9)\". \"Years of old\": like the years of Abel, when there was no worship of idols in the world\".",
                "21": "\"<b>For truly, You have rejected us, Bitterly raged against us</b> (Lamentations 5:22)\": Rabbi Shimon son of Lakish said: \"If there is rejection there is no hope, and if there is raging there is hope, as everyone who is angry is able to be calmed in the end\". "
