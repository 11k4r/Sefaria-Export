And the people of his time served and bowed to him. He was so - an established king, and he was wise and he saw in the wisdom of the stars that there will be one man born in his time that will oppose him and deny him from his faith and he will be victorious over him. And he [Nimrod] trembled with a great fear. What did he do? He sent after his lesser officers and he told them this matter. He consulted them about what to do concerning this future child that will come. They advised him \"we agree on the following: that you will build a great palace and place guards in the opening and declare among your kingdom that every woman that they pass through and come there after ...[unknown]... if it's a son, you will slaughter him on her womb and if it's a daughter, it will live and you will give gifts to the mother and dress her in royal garments and they will call before her. Such will be done to a mother of a daughter. When Nimrod hear their advice, he was greatly gladdened much so. He declared in all the countries of his kingdom that there will come all the nations to build a great palace for the king 60 ama high, 80 ama long. After it was completed, he declared that all the women shall come and pass through the house and remain there until they gave birth. He commanded officials to bring them there. ...[unknown]... He decreed that the born son will be slaughtered on the chest of the mother and if a daughter, the mother was dressed in clothing of fine linens and silks colorfully embroidered and she will go out from there and they will give her much honor. So commanded King Nimrod and they left the house with honor."

His wealth was so much the more so, wondrous and vast. Where did he get all this money? From the money that Yosef the Righteous had collected in Egypt [in return for distributing the stored grain during the seven years of famine], which had filled three towers. Each tower was a hundred amot [about 180 feet] deep, a hundred amot wide, and one hundred amot inside. Yosef gave them all to the house of Pharaoh, and did not give his children even five silver [coins]. For what reason? Because he proceeded faithfully, as it says (Ber 47:14), \"Yosef brought the silver into Pharaoh's house.\" When Korach found one of these towers, he became proud of his wealth. Another one was found by Antoninus, and the third is hidden for the World to Come.  What was the origin of Korach's dispute with Moshe and with Aharon? It was for the sake of a particular widow who had a single ewe. When she came to shear it [for the first time], Aharon heard and took the wool. She went to Korach and cried out and wept, telling him, \"This and this has Aharon done to me.\" Korach came by Aharon and said to him, \"What is it with you and this widow, that poor woman? Return to her her wool!\" Aharon said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the premier-part of the shearing of your sheep you are to give him' (Dev 18:4).\" What did Korach do? He took four silver [coins] and gave [them] to her. She went off, and Korach went full of anger. The days [passed] and the ewe gave birth to a [first-born] male. Aharon heard and took the lamb. She went before Korach, crying out and weeping. Korach said to Aharon, \"What is it with you and the poor woman, this widow?\" He said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'every firstling that is born in your flock and in your herd, the male-one, you are to hallow to ha-Shem your God' (Dev 15:19).\" Korach went on his way, full of anger. When the widow saw this, she went and slaughtered the ewe. Aharon heard, and came and took the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach. Korach said to him, \"What is it with you and this widow?\" He said to him, \"They are mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the priest is to be given the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach' (Dev 18:3).\" And Korach went, full of anger. When the widow saw this, she stood and made an oath, saying the meat of this ewe is set-aside for me. Aharon heard and took all the meat, as it says, 'everything specially-devoted in Israel -- it is for you' (Bam 18:14, Parshat Korach).\"  He [Korach] said to him [Moshe], \"Why should you, son of Amram, establish authority over us?\" [not in ed. Jellinek: 'Should you pluck out the eyes of these men, we will not come up.' They said this verse specifically against Moshe and Aharon.] Moshe said to him, \"To the morrow, judgement.\" In the morning, Korach had gathered to him 250 men (and alongside Moshe and Aharon, all the prophets), these with their fire pans, these offering sacrifices and these burning incense. Immediately Moshe Rabbeinu stood in prayer before ha-Shem and said, \"Multiplier of Universes, is this prophecy you have sent us true?\" Ha-Shem replied to him, \"It is true. And you will see what I will do to Korach.\" This is why he was named Korach -- for in his days, 'a void was created in Israel' (Sanhedrin 109b).  Moshe said further before the Holy One of Blessing, \"If these die as all people do, if their lot be the common fate of all humanity, ha-Shem did not send me (Bam 16:29).\" The Holy One of Blessing said to Moshe, \"You have rejected a major principle of faith\" (Passover Haggadah, Maggid, Four Children; and Yer. Sanhedrin 10:1, 50a). Moshe said before the Holy One of Blessing, \"Multiplier of Universes, 'if ha-Shem creates a new creation...' (Bam 16:30). The Holy One of Blessing said to him, \"I will do according to your will.\"  Immediately the Holy One of Blessing hinted to the ground and it swallowed them [Korach and his followers] up to their navels. Korach and all his household cried out and said, \"Moshe! Moshe! Have mercy on us!\" Moshe said to them, \"'Too much is yours, Sons of Levi!' (Bam 16:7).\" Immediately they were swallowed up [by the earth], and the rest were burned up [by fire], as it says, 'so they went down, they and all theirs, alive, into Sheol; the earth covered them (Bam 16:33).' And it is written, 'fire went out from before the presence of ha-Shem and consumed the fifty and two hundred men, those who had brought-near the incense.'  Those that descended below the earth remained there. And they reasoned that they would never rise up [again]. Until Hannah came and prophesied for them, as it [the song of Hannah] says, 'ha-Shem brings death and gives life, lowers to Sheol and raises up' (Shmuel I 2:6). But with all this, they didn't believe that they would rise again, until the Beit ha-Mikdash was destroyed and the gates of the Beit ha-Mikdash were swallowed up, as it says, 'her gates have sunk into the ground' (Eichah 2:9). They [the gates] came by Korach and he grabbed hold of them. Immediately they believed and said, \"When these gates rise up, so too will we rise up with them.\" And they were appointed the guardians [or, those who carried out the observances] over those gates until they rise up.  Thus was Korach and his wealth obliterated from among the community. Therefore it says, 'Do not praise the wealthy for their wealth,' for all wealth belongs to the Holy One of Blessing. As it says, 'Mine is the silver and mine is the gold -- the word of ha-Shem, Master of Legions' (Hag 2:8). [ed. Jellinek: And it says, 'One who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor' (Mish 21:21).]  "

                    "4": "...\"Let not the rich person glorify themselves with their wealth (Yirm 9:22).\"  This [refers to] Korach the Levite, who had three hundred mules just to carry the load of the keys to his hidden storehouses.  His wealth was so much the more so, wondrous and vast.  Where did he get all this?  It was the money that Yosef had collected in Egypt [in return for distributing the stored grain during the seven years of famine], which had filled three towers.  Each tower was a hundred amot [about 180 feet] deep and a hundred amot wide.  As soon as Korach found one of these towers, he became proud of his wealth.  Another one was found by Antiochus, and the third is hidden for the World to Come.  The origin of Korach's dispute was a widow who had a single ewe.  When she came to shear it [for the first time], Aharon heard and took the wool.  She went to Korach and wept before him, telling him, \"This and this has Aharon done to me.\"  Korach came by Aharon and said to him, \"What have you done by this widow, to take her wool?\"  Aharon said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the premier-part of the shearing of your sheep you are to give him' (Dev 18:4).\"  So Korach took four silver [coins] and gave [them] to her.  The days [passed] and the ewe gave birth to its first-born.  Aharon heard and took the lamb.  She went and wept before Korach.  Korach said to Aharon, \"What is it for you and for this widow, to take the son of the ewe?\"  He said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'every firstling that is born in your flock and in your herd, the male-one, you are to hallow to ha-Shem your God' (Dev 15:19).\"  Korach went to him, full of anger.  When the widow saw this, she sent and slaughtered the ewe.  Aharon heard, and came and book the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach.  Korach said to him, \"What is it for you, by this widow?\"  He said to him, \"They are mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the priest is to be given the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach' (Dev 18:3).\"  When the widow saw this, she stood and specially-devoted the meat.  Aharon heard and took the meat.  Korach said to him, \"It wasn't enough, everything that you took from her?  Now even the meat?\"  He said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'everything specially-devoted in Israel -- it is for you' (Bam 18:14, Parshat Korach).\"  He [Korach] said to him [Moshe], \"Why have you, son of Amram, established authority over us, and been raised up over us?\"  Moshe said to him, \"Unto the morrow, judgement.\"  In the morning, Korach had gathered to him 250 men with [fire-]pans and smoking-incense.  Immediately Moshe stood before the Holy One of Blessing and said, \"Multiplier of Universes, is this prophecy you have sent me true?\"  Ha-Shem replied to him, \"It is true.  And now you will see what I will do to Korach, and why his name is called Korach.  For in his days, there will be made baldness in Israel.\"  Immediately the Holy One of Blessing instructed the ground and it swallowed them [Korach and his followers] up to their navels.  Korach cried out and said, \"Moshe!  Have mercy on us!\"  Moshe said to them, \"'Too much is yours, Sons of Levi!' (Bam 15:7).\"  Immediately they were swallowed up [by the earth], and the rest were burned up [by fire].  Those that were swallowed [by the earth] reasoned that they would never rise up [again].  Until Hannah came and prophesied for them, as it [the song of Hannah] says, 'ha-Shem brings death and gives life, lowers to Sheol and raises up (Shmuel I 2:6).'  But in all this they didn't believe, until the Beit ha-Mikdash destroyed.

It is also the time for all those who are at least 50 years old who you led for the duration of the Exodus. Get up, it is the time for the seventy elders, and those with the officials of Israel shall come with Eliezer and Aaron, and they shall gather at Moses's tent, and they asked about his welfare, and after that they will go to the Tent of Meeting. This is the order in which they should go: Moses in the middle, Aaron to his right, Eliezer to his left, and the Elders on either side, and all of Israel behind them, and then all of them should enter the Tent of Meeting. Aaron should sit to the right of Moses, who will sit at the head. Eliezer will be at his left and the officers behind them. And you will say to him: \"God decrees that Moses and Aaron will die.\" And God said to Moses: \"my servant Moses, in every part of my house you were faithful, you have been a great speaker, and but there is a great request that I must ask of you, and it's hard for me to ask. Moses asked: \"What's the request?\" God said: \"You need to gather your brother unto his people (bury your brother), for he will not enter the land that I have given to the Israelites, those who rebelled against my commandments at Merivah. Moses said: \"God, all is known and clear to you and your holy throne, for you are master of the world, and all of your creations that you created in this world, and by your hand they came to be, and by your hand you will do that which you will, but it is not apparent to me how you could ask me to tell my brother that he is going to die. My brother is greater than me, and how can I speak to him and tell him to go up to the mountain of Hor where he will die.\" God responded to Moses: \" do not tell him with words, rather take Aaron and Eliezer his son and bring them to the mountain of Hor, and there you will go up with them and speak to him softly and gently, but also in a way that he will understand what's going on. When the three of you are on the mountain, strip Aaron of his clothes, and dress Eliezer his son in them, and Aaron will be gathered unto his people, and die there. ", 
                "2": "\"I lost the three shepherds in one month\" (Zecharia 11:8); and thus, in one month, Aaron, Miriam, and Moses died. Miriam died on the 1st of the month of Nisan, and the well closed up; and in the second of Nissan, Aaron's sons died; On the first of Av, Aaron died, and the clouds of glory dissipated; On the seventh of Adar Moses our teacher, and God's servant, died. Even though they didn't all die in the same month, it's considered as if it were one month. Each had a gift that they gave to the Israelites. By the merit of Miriam, God gave the well, by the merit of Aaron, the clouds of glory, By the merit of Moses, the Mana. When Miriam died, the well closed so the Israelites could see that it was by her merit that God granted them the well. Moses and Aaron bewailed her internally, and the Israelites did so publicly. Moses didn't know about the Israelites mourning until after six hours, when the Israelites came to them and said: \"how long will you sit and mourn?\" He said to them \"should I not continue to mourn my sister who has died.\" \"They said to him: \"just as you mourn for one soul, all the more so mourn for all of us.\" He said to them: \"why\" They said to him \"because we do not have water to drink.\" He stood and went and saw that there was no water in the well, and he began to argue with them, he said:\"did I not say to you that I can't carry this people on my own, did I not appoint for you officers for the thousands, and officers for the hundreds, and the fifties, and the twenties, I gave you officials, and chiefs, and great elders, and they are to busy themselves with your problems.\" They said to him: \"Everything is on you, for you are the one who brought us out of Egypt and brought us to this terrible place, if you give us water, everything will be fine, but if you don't, then we will stone you.\" When Moses heard this, he fled from them and went into the tent of meeting. God said to him \"Moses what is going on?\" Moses said before the Master of the World: \"your children want to stone me, and were I not to have fled, I would have already been stoned to death.\" God said said: \"how long will will you speak ill of my children, was it not enough for you that I told you at Horeb, just a little more and they will stone you. Now go and pass before them and see whether they will actually stone you, and it is said the Torah: \"God said to Moses, pass before the people.\" Moses went first and his cohort after him, and Moses didn't know which rock God had intended to give to them for bringing out water. The Israelites found a rock that was dripping, and they stood upon it. When Moses saw them standing on it, he turned around and said to God \"how long will you put our lives at risk?\" He said to them, \"until I bring water out of the rock.\" The Israelites said: \"give us water so that we can drink!\" Moses responded to them \"How long will you continue to rebel? Does a creation rebel against its creator? As such, you are rebelling against God. Moses said:  \"God wants to give you water.\" The Israelites said: \"you are the prophet who shepherds us in the dessert and now you say you don't know which rock God intends you to bring water out of? Moses and Aaron gathered the people around a different rock, as it says in the Torah \"Moses and Aaron gathered the community at the face of the rock.\" Moses said to himself: \"If I command the rock to bring out water and it doesn't, I'll be embarrassed before the community, and they will say to me, 'Moses, where is your alleged wisdom.'\" At the very same moment Moses told the Israelites, \"you know that God can do miracles for you,  and you know that miracles are beyond me. For when the knowledge of man is divinely inspired, it is not his own knowledge or wisdom. Moses brought down his staff upon the back of the rock, and he did so himself, as he spoke to the israelites , as it says in the Torah \"from this rock, we will bring you water.\" The rock began to fill itself to bring out water, and when Moses saw it, he lifted his arm again and struck the rock, as it says in the Torah \"he hit the rock twice with his staff.\" This time though, blood came out, as it says in the Psalms, \"yes, he hit the rock and the waters flowed (Psalm 78:20).\"  It's a flow of blood, as we see from the laws of menstruation \"when a woman has a discharge of blood (Leviticus 15:25).\" Moses came and said to God \"the rock isn't bringing out water, only blood.\" God said to the rock: \"why are you only bringing out blood, and not water?\" The rock said \"Master of the Universe, why did Moses hit me?\" God then asked Moses, \"why did you hit the rock?\" Moses responded: \"In order to bring out water.\" God said: \"Did I tell you to hit the rock? Did I not tell you to speak to it with words?\" Moses responded: \"I did speak to it, but nothing came out!\" God responded \"did you not command all of Israel \"in justice you shall judge your people (Leviticus 19)? Thus, why didn't you judge the rock with justice? This is how I raised you in Egypt, as it says in scripture 'God fed him honey from the rock,  (Deuteronomy 32:13).' It befits you to lead, and thus  say to my children \"listen you rebels!\" Don't read \"rebels\" rather \"idiots\" shotim (also a hominem for drinkers). They are idiots, and you have your eyes open. A nation of idiots will not enter the land of Israel, as it says in the Torah \"you will not bring this community . . .\" Therefore God said to Moses, \"tell the rock to turn it's blood into water.\" It is thus written in scripture: \"who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flinty rock into a spring (Psalm 114:8).\" (Note this is a Psalm recited during Hallel on Rosh Chodesh, the beginning of the month). When they reached the beginning of the month, God said to Moses, \"your time has come to an end.\" Moses said before him, \"please God, let it not be soon.\" \"It is tomorrow\" responded God, thus Moses was distressed all day, for he didn't know when exactly his death would come. ...", 
                "4": "When Moses heard this, he was deeply troubled in his heart, and he didn't know what to do. He cried a great and mighty cry, until it was time was time to deliver the news to his brother Aaron that he would die. Moses was steadfast to act, and went with this brother Aaron to tell him of the matter. He went to the Tent of Meeting and found Aaron there. That very day, Moses taught the custom: sit and cry only until the crowing of the rooster. Moses called Elieer and said to him: \" go and get the elders and the officers, for God has told me of an important matter. They came and gathered at the tent of Aaron. Aaron stood and found Moses standing. Aaron said to Moses: \"my brother, why have you taught us this custom today?\" He said to him: God is revealing something that I must tell you.\" He said to him: \"Speak!\" He responded, \"not until we leave here.\" Moses stood and dressed Aaron with the eight vestiges of the priestly clothing within Aaron's tent. After that he left. Therefore it was added as a custom that day that one should sit and cry only until the crowing of the rooster.\" Aaron was placed in the along with Moses; to their right was Joshua, to their left, the elders. The officers were both here and there, and all of Israel was behind them. Because the Israelites saw Aaron with the same respect as Moses, they rejoiced a great rejoicing, and said that \"Aaron is ascending farther toward the spirit of God. Because they loved him, they all came out  after him, and when they arrived at the tent of meeting, Aaron requested to enter the tent, but Moses wouldn't let him. Moses said to him: \"Let's go outside of the camp, for that is the intended direction.\" Aaron said to him: \"tell me what did God say to you?\" Moses responded: \"I'll tell you once we get to the mountain.\" Moses commanded the people (just as he did at Sinai, and just as Abraham did his lads on the way to Moriyah) stay here until we return to you, me, Aaron and Eliezer will go up to the top of the mountain, we will hear the word of God, and then we will return. The three of them went up. Moses wanted to say something to Aaron, but didn't know how, and didn't know what to say. Moses finally said: \"Aaron my brother, what are the appointed things that that God has given you?\" He responded: \"These\" He said: \"What?\" Aaron said: \"God has given me the altar, the table, upon which sits the bread of welcoming.\" Moses responded: \"These are the things that God has appointed to your hand, but now, God has something that he is asking of you.\" \"What is it\" Aaron asked? \"God has given you a light,\" said Moses. Aaron asked: \"What are you talking about, god has given more more than just a single light, God has given me seven (the lights of the menorah), and they are currently lit in the Tent of Meeting. Moses gave Aaron the sense that he was talking in parable, and that the candle of which he was referring, was really Aaron's soul. As it says in scripture: \"the soul of man is the light of God (Proverbs 20:27).\" Moses saw that Aaron still didn't understand the parable. He said to him \"in truth, you are called simple,\" as it says in scripture: \"and of Levi it is said, your Urim and Tumim (being read here is your light and your simpleness) are for a man of your faith.\" Immediatly, the cave opened at its mouth. Moses said: \"Aaron my brother, enter the cave.\" Aaron responded \"ok,\" and Moses request to strip Aaron of his clothing. Is it possible that when he stripped his clothing, he died naked, and was buried naked? God forbid! Rather, every high priest wears eight of the priestly garments, but the lower priests wear four. Aaron wore, eight, and Eliezer wore four. Moses only took four of Moses's clothes from Aaron and gave them to Eliezer to make him the high priest. Aaron still remained with four vestiges of clothing. They said to Eliezer, wait here until we leave, and Aaron and Moses entered. They saw a made bed and a set table with a menorah lit, and the angels of God standing on either side. Aaron said to Moses: \" my brother, how long will you hide from me what God has told you?You know that when God speaks with you first directly..."

                "33": "\"The angels who are in charge of healing are Sanoy, Sansenoy and Semangelof. While God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is not good for man to be alone' (Genesis 2:18). He also created a woman, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air. Adam stood in prayer before his Creator: 'Sovereign of the universe!' he said, 'the woman you gave me has run away.' At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels to bring her back.\"Said the Holy One to Adam, 'If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.' The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, 'We shall drown you in the sea.'\"'Leave me!' she said. 'I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.' \"When the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: 'Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.\""
