Afterwards he approached me and said \"Rabbi, I am dead and not alive\", I said to him: \"If you are dead - why do you need the firewood?\". He responded: \"Rabbi, listen carefully to what I am saying to you, when I was alive, my friend and I were doing a sin in my palace and when we came here we were sentenced to punishment by fire, when I gather wood they burn my friend, and when my friend gathers wood they burn me\". I asked him: \"Till when do you have to endure this punishment?\" He told me: \"When I came here I left my wife pregnant and I know she is pregnant with a son, therefore, please take caution with him and from the time he is born until he is five years old  take him to he house of his rabbi to learn biblical verse (mikrah) because when he can say Barchu Et Hashem HaMevorach then I will be saved from the punishment of Gehenna\".
