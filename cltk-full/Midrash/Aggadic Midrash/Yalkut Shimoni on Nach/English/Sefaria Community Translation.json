From the western corner, all types of weather comes into the world. And from the northern corner destruction comes into the world. The northern corner Hashem created, but didn't finish. He said, 'Anyone who claims to be a god, come and finish this northern corner. When you come to try and finish it, you will see that I am G-d.' From the northern corner comes all demons and evil spirits, and all destructive forces into the world. This is what it means 'From the north evil shall break forth.'\""

            "1": "<b>And he will be like a planted tree:</b> Rabbi Yose expounded, \"To what is the matter similar? To a man that was walking in an arid land and his soul was dismayed with thirst. He [then] found a pleasant tree with a stream below it and sweet fruit and pleasant shade. He ate from its fruit and drank from its waters and slept it its shade and he returned to himself. At the time that he left to go, he said to it, 'Tree, O, tree, with what can I bless you? That there should be streams below you? Behold, there are streams below you. That your fruit should be sweet? Behold, your fruit are sweet. That your shade should be pleasant? Behold, your shade is pleasant. But rather, May it be the Will that all of the saplings that will be planted from you be like you.' So did the Holy One, blessed be He say to Avraham, 'Avraham, with what can I bless you? If I say, \"Go and make Me known,\" behold, you have made Me known. If I say, \"Crown Me,\" behold, you have crowned Me But rather, May it be the Will that all of the offspring of your innards be like you.' Therefore it is stated, 'And he will be like a planted tree, etc. that gives off its fruit in its time' - these are the Torah scholars that will be many from your seed; 'and its leaf does not wither' - that masters of faith not cease from your seed; 'and everything that he does be successful' - this is Avraham, who shook up all of the kings of the East and the West, as it is stated (Isaiah 41:2), 'Who is the one that aroused from the East, justice calls to him in his footstep.'\""
