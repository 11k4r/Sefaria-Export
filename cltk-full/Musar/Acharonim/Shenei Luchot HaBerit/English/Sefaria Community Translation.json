The Almighty decrees a decree and then repentance, prayer and charity can change that to the better; and sometimes it changes from good to bad.  But they walk in darkness because there can be no change, heaven forbid.  Rather all is one and is only a matter of one desire.  That is to say this inquiry is a matter of faith.  I will also copy what I wrote as a child in my pamphlet, even though it is a little different.  In any event, it all goes together in one place.  These are my words.  Written in section of Godliness in the gate of unity.  And the whole faith of unity is complete; as there is no body nor strength of the body, nor a separate mind, and will not change from thought to thought or from action to action or from one leader to another.  It is a complete intellect and simple and unique in all parts of His names and in all attributes.  And a change in actions on the part of the leadership only exists from the side of the recipients.  Because the one who walks in innocence and straightness, and keeps a good home, receives goodness derived from God Almighty.  And he who perverts his path and distances himself, is distanced from the good derived from God and the opposite is derived from Him.  ",
                "1": "For if the reward and punishment were the arrangement, then, Heaven Forbid, it will look as if there is a change from desire to desire.  Because now he agrees one way and then agrees another way.  The matter of Desire is a secret that reveals the emanation that includes all the changes according to awakenings of awakening.  This is how it continues from the essence and in nature.  The idea is if we sanctify ourselves below, we sanctify Him above in the same nature of the matter that arises.  And if he defiles himself, he defiles him from above in the same nature of the matter that has arisen.  And if he awakens himself and throws of his ways of exile and binds himself in holiness, he is found in nature sanctified.  And the Will of heaven is not changed, for on the contrary, the will is revealed and everything is expected and the authority is given to do so.  ",

In consideration of the sadness that one feels at one's table--in the midst of the joy and celebration [lit. drinking] there--the Holy Blessed One accounts it to one as if one has rebuilt His House and rebuilt all the ruins of the Temple. Happy is one's portion!' (Zohar 2:157:2).   Therefore it is customary to recite the Psalm 'By the waters of Babylon' (Psalms 137) before Grace after Meals, particularly since the table corresponds to the (Temple) altar, while, through our many sins, the altar itself is no longer.  One should call to mind [the teaching], 'Woe to the children who have been banished from their Father's table' (Talmud Berachot 3a).   The banishment from the Table (shulchan, sh.l.h.n) was caused by the power of the Snake (lenachash, l.n.h.sh), as is taught in the Zohar [about the word] Eichah ('.y.kh.h, 'Alas;' the name of the Book of Lamentations):  'I shall set enmity' (Eivah, '.y.b.h) (Genesis 3:15), an anagram for א׳יכה י׳שבה ב׳דד ה׳עיר 'Alas, the city sits solitary' ('.y.b.h) (Lamentations 1:1).  On Shabbat and Festivals one recites the Psalm 'When the Name restores the fortunes of Zion' (Psalms 126)."

When our sages criticize Jacob of whom the Torah said: \"Jacob settled down in the land of Canaan, in the land of the sojournings of his father\" (Gen. 37:1) he wanted to dwell in tranquility the Holy One said isn't it enough that the tzadikim [will enjoy the world-to come? The problems of Yosef happened to him] (Bereshit Rabbah 84:3). He could only be in the land of sojourning - \"I am but a sojourner\" (Gen. 23:4) and it was the land of Cnaan, and \"sojournings [megurei] of his father\" is the secret of \"Fear of Isaac\", which is the characteristic of Judgment, \"terror [magor] all around\" (Jer. 20:10) and \"around Him a fierce fire\" (Psalms 50:3). And this is (Lev. 25:23) \"For you are sojourners and settlers with Me\" - the moment you want to settle in peace, you will be sojourners. And your sign is \"It is a land that consumes those who settle in it\" (Numbers 13:32) - the land consumes those who want to settle in contentment, and simply want to eat its fruit and just feel pleasure from the land. And even if the spies said this verse [with this understanding] they did so to speak for evil,  they profaned something sacred and so it was profane for them."

                    "66": "It is well known that in order to rehabilitate oneself spiritually one must exercise  repentance, prayer and tzedakah. All of these three factors of a person's rehabilitation depend on their mouth. Prayer - \"my mouth shall praise Ad-nai etc\" (Ps. 145:21). And so too Torah study - \"and you shall teach them etc\" (Deut. 6:7), that one should repeat them with your mouth. Repentance - they already said \"in your mouth and in your heart to to it\" (Deut. 30:14) refers to repentance, and the essence of repentance is verbal confession through a broken heart (Eruvin 54) and so too \"bring words with you and return\" (Hosea 14:3) Charity, too,  as our sages (Baba Batra 9b) say that anyone who gives charity acquires six blessings; if someone also tries to make the recipient feel better by kind and encouraging words he will qualify for eleven blessings - behold the essence of tzedakah is verbal encouragement. Therefore, the words voice, fasting and money [קול צום ממון] all have the same numerical value - 136, and they are [symbolic of] tefilah, tzedakah and teshuvah. The very first part of our parsha Ki Tetze alludes to all the three ingredients of repentance. Even tough the plain meaning is war, the paragraph refers to the ongoing battle between a person and their evil urge. Many of the commentators wrote, regarding the previous portion in Parashat Shoftim on the verse about the siege laid to a city (Deut. 20:19) that this is about the greatest war a person has to fight in this life. The matter is illustrated in the Talmud by the story of the elderly sage who met soldiers of the army of Alexander the Great at the time of his victorious return from a major battle. These soldiers were in a very happy for having conquered such a big city. The sage told them 'you came back from a small battle, get ready for the battle of your lives, against the evil inclination.' This is what the sages meant when they said \"the Torah spoke only against the evil inclination\" (Kidushin 21b). Through this allegory, we can understand the whole reason why these rules are only regarding a permitted war - permission has been given to us and the choice is ours. Once a person makes the first move in this war, then one can be certain that the Holy one of Blessing will help, as our sages say \"were it not for the help of the Holy One, people would not be able to subdue the evil inclination\" (Sukkah 52b) - and this is \"God delivers him to your hand\" (Deut. 21:10). It is significant that the Torah here employs the singular. Behold, regarding war we have a tradition that a nation does not succumb to another nation unless its protective spirit in the Celestial Regions has first suffered defeat. Therefore the text says \"and gave him\" - him is the protective spirit. And this is also regarding the other war [the personal] because a person has many enemies, which are the negative forces created by one's evil deeds - from every sin a destroying angel is created, and they are all presided by the evil inclination, which is Samael, Satan, the Angel of Death, etc. (Baba Batra 16a). And this is the meaning of  \"Ad-nai your God will deliver him into your hand and you will take him captive\" (Deut. 21:10). Taking this enemy prisoner is possible only with the help of Torah study and mitzvot, as it is written about Torah: \"You went up to the heights, having taken captives\" (Ps. 68:19)."
