Then he [should] use all of the these traits [of the Crown] - to open the Highest Sources. As if he focuses his concentration on the lights of the Crown in his prayers, but he acts the opposite with his actions, how will he open the Source of the Crown? And behold, he actually pushes It off with his actions. And behold the things are an a fortiori argument (<i>kal vechomer</i>): If the Crown does not dwell in the Highest Sefirot (divine emanations) that intensify holy judgments and holy anger, is it not even more so that the Crown and Its light will not dwell upon a person who is intensifying external anger - even if it is for the sake of the Heavens?

And when he constantly toils to reach this trait, all the other traits will be dragged after it.

Likewise, [should] a person make himself [to be an] actual nothing; and he [should] think of his disappearance, as much better than his existence.

And the Holy One, blessed be He, created the world widely open to the side of evil and sin. There is no side that does not have physicality, the evil impulse and defect - like a type of portico. It does not have fences but rather has a large breach, open towards the side of evil, to the bottom side.

However a small fence will not suffice for the sinner that sinned and repented. Rather, he needs to fence himself with several difficult fences, since he already breached the small fence once.

And the reason for this practice is the secret of \"And the goat carries upon him all of their iniquities to a desolate land\" (Leviticus 16:22). And its explanation is that it carries the actual sins. But this is very difficult: And shall Israel sin and the goat carry [it]? Rather [this] trait is like this: A person confesses [sins], and his intention in the confession is to receive purification upon himself; like the matter that David stated (Psalms 51:4), \"Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.\" And so, in our saying, \"Purge [me] in Your great mercy,\" [one] is only praying that the afflictions be light, such that there not be a hindrance of Torah [study]; and this [is also the intention of] that which we say, \"But not through bad (harsh) afflictions.\" And so, in his saying, \"And You are righteous about all that happens to me\" - he intends to truly accept afflictions with a pleasant countenance, in order to atone; as there are iniquities that [only] afflictions purge or that [only] death purges.

And about this thing it is fitting that [just] like the Highest Wisdom does not disgrace anything in existence and everything was made from There, as it is written, \"You made all of them with Wisdom\" - so [too, should] the mercy of a person be over all of the His creations, may He be blessed. And for this reason was the holy Rebbe punished. Since he did not pity the young calf that was hiding with him, and he said to it, \"Go - you were created for this,\" afflictions came upon him (Bava Metzia 85a). As they were from the side of judgement; since behold, mercy protects from judgement. And when he had mercy on a weasel and said, \"It is written (Psalms 145:9), 'and His mercies are over all of His creatures,'\" he was saved from the judgement - since the light of Wisdom was spread over him and the afflictions withdrew. And upon this way, he [should] not disgrace anything in existence from that which exists, as all of them are with Wisdom. And [so] he should not uproot a plant except for a need, and not kill an animal except for a need. And [then] he should chose a nice death, with a checked knife, to have mercy in as much as is possible."

As this is the will of the Holy One, blessed be He - in the way that the faithful shepherd stated (Numbers 11:12), \"Did I conceive all this people, that You should say to me, 'Carry them in your bosom.'\" And in this [way], he [should] carry all of the people of God 'as a nurse carries an infant' - 'with his forearm he gathers the lambs, with his bosom carries, leads the nurse-mothers.' He [should] remember the hidden, seek the young, heal the broken, sustain the needy and return the lost.
