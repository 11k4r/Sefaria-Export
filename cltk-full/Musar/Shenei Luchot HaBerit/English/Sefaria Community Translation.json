Because now he agrees one way and then agrees another way.  The matter of Desire is a secret that reveals the emanation that includes all the changes according to awakenings of awakening.  This is how it continues from the essence and in nature.  The idea is if we sanctify ourselves below, we sanctify Him above in the same nature of the matter that arises.  And if he defiles himself, he defiles him from above in the same nature of the matter that has arisen.  And if he awakens himself and throws of his ways of exile and binds himself in holiness, he is found in nature sanctified.

But they walk in darkness because there can be no change, heaven forbid.  Rather all is one and is only a matter of one desire.  That is to say this inquiry is a matter of faith.  I will also copy what I wrote as a child in my pamphlet, even though it is a little different.  In any event, it all goes together in one place.  These are my words.  Written in section of Godliness in the gate of unity.  And the whole faith of unity is complete; as there is no body nor strength of the body, nor a separate mind, and will not change from thought to thought or from action to action or from one leader to another.  It is a complete intellect and simple and unique in all parts of His names and in all attributes.  And a change in actions on the part of the leadership only exists from the side of the recipients.  Because the one who walks in innocence and straightness, and keeps a good home, receives goodness derived from God Almighty.  And he who perverts his path and distances himself, is distanced from the good derived from God and the opposite is derived from Him.  ",

In the future, the fathers will be responsible for the deaths of their children who are nursing, and have committed no sin, and those who are weaned and have committed no sins, and died from the sickness whose fathers did not take them away [from the city]. Every man who fears god should fear every eventuality. These things that are included in protecting the body are included in the warnings of (Devarim 4:9) 'take utmost care and watch yourselves scrupulously' and this is also the way of the world to take care of one's body since it is the container that the soul is wrapped up in so it will be a throne for the soul."
