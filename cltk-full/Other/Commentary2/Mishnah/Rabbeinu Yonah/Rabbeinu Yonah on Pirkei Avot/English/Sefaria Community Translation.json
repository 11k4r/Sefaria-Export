Since a person ascends the steps of piousness with doing one of these matters they placed the tractate Avot in the order of damages. For they also say to fulfil the words of Blessings which is in the order of Zeraim? Because it speaks of the blessings of seeds and fruits they placed it in that order. Futhermore, since it is the teachings of the Sanhedrin, they placed it in the order of the laws, for all the wise men mentioned here until Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai are from the Sanhedrin. ",
