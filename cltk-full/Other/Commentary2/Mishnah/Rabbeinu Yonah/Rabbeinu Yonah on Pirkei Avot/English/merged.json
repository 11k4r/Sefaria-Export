Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 30a) \"One who wishes to be pious should fulfill the words of Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), and [some] said about it, the words of Damages (Nezikin)\". And since a person ascends the steps of piousness by doing one of these matters, they placed [Avot] in the Order of Damages. And even though they also said to fulfill the words of Blessings (Berakhot) which is in the order of Seeds (Zeraim); because it speaks of the blessings on seeds and fruits, they placed it in that order (Editor's note: See what Midrash Shmuel wrote about this in the name of Rabbi Yosef Nachmias, may his memory be blessed). Furthermore, since it is the teachings of the Sanhedrin, they placed it in the order of the laws (of Damages); and so [too], all the sages mentioned [here] until Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai are all from the Sanhedrin.

                "5": "<b>They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment:</b> They said [this] to teachers of legal decisions and decisors of legal decisions and decisors of judgement; that they should not rely on the first thought, but rather upon great deliberation and incisive investigation, so that they not err in their evaluation. As a man who is quick to make a decision is called a sinner - and even though he thought he was saying the truth, it is not [considered] accidental but rather is [considered] to be close to volitional, since he did not put it into his heart to say, the quick hearts do not understand to know. As error is found in all men, as the rabbis say (Avot 4:13), \" Be careful in study, for an error in study is considered an intentional transgression.\" And about this matter, Shlomo, peace be upon him, said (Proverbs 26:12), \"If you see a man who thinks himself wise, there is more hope for a dullard than for him.\" And it is as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Avot 4:7), \"One who is nonchalant about giving legal decisions is an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit.\" Therefore, it is incumbent upon a man who makes legal decisions to go back and forth on the matter and let his thought ripen and to hold on to it; as the matter that they said (Sanhedrin 35a) [that] we should ripen a judgement, as through ripening and deliberation, he adds reasoning to his reasoning and sharpness to his sharpness, until he judges a completely true judgement. As he will see to say with the second thought that which he did not see with the first. And about this matter, Asaf said (Psalms 73:21), \"As my heart ripened and my kidneys were silent,\" which is to say [that] after my heart has ripened and been sharp with wisdom and with my kidneys, I have been silent and have refined my understanding to know. As without this, I have not known, and this is my portion. (And as) it is after it, \"I was a dolt, without knowledge; I was brutish toward You.\" And the reason [they] said, <b>Be deliberate in judgment,</b> is in order to warn about judgments more than other legal decisions, as they are fundamental in the knowledge of Him, may He be blessed and elevated; and as Yirmiyahu the prophet said (Jeremiah 9:23), \"ponder and know Me, for I am the Lord who makes kindness, justice, and equity in the world; for in these I delight, declares the  Lord.\" And how can a man a ponder and know God, as it is not possible? However with this have we known Him, by dong judgment and justice, since God does these. And that is what is stated (Jeremiah 22:16), \"He judged for the poor and needyâ€” then all was well. That is truly knowing Me, declares the  Lord.\" And it is is written in another place (Michah 6:8), \" And what does the Lord require of you? Only to do justice and to love kindness,\" since judgments are a pillar of the Torah. And from them the world is made firm, as is said in the Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 30 3), \"It is written in front of The Ten Commandments, 'and they will judge the people at all times' (Exodus 18:22). And after the Ten Commandment, it is written, 'And these are the laws' (Exodus 21 1). There is a parable [about this] concerning a matron that was walking along the way and her armed guards were walking in front of her and behind her.\"",

And [some of] the prophets of the Second Temple were in that group, as they said in Yevamot 16a, \"Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said, 'When Chaggai said these three things, he was sitting on this mortar.'\" Hence the prophets of the Second Temple were there after the destruction, since Haggai the prophet was there. And the men of the Great Assembly transmitted it to the men of their generation. And the sages [transmitted it] to their children after them in each and every generation. And the transmission was from one sage to another, until all of the sages of Israel gathered and a suggestion was given from all of their mouths to write down the oral Torah. And [so] they wrote and sealed the Talmud, and afterwards nothing was added to it and nothing was taken away from it. And that generation also transmitted it to the Geonim and the transmission was from one Gaon to another, one rabbi to another - until this day. ", 
                "7": "<b>And make a fence for the Torah:</b> like the matter that is stated (Leviticus 18:30), \"And you shall guard My guarding\"; which is to say, make a guarding for my guarding. And a fence is a great thing and it is praiseworthy to make a fence for the commandments so that the one who fears the word of God not stumble in them. Hence one who observes the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed - which are the fences for the commandments of the Torah - has shown more love for [this] fear than one who does the commandment itself. As the doing of the commandments does not prove fear like the one who observes the fences, since he is careful from the start not to come to error. However, the one who does the commandment but does not observe the fence shows us that if it is good in his eyes to do the commandment, [yet] it is not bad in his eyes if he errs in it; and that he is not concerned about the fear that he will make a breach in it, and 'one who makes a breach will be bitten by a snake.' Behold that the words of the sages, may their be blessed, are pillars and 'trees' in the fear of Heaven; which is a foundation of the world and a fundamental principle of virtue. And all of the commandments are appetizers for it, as they said in the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1), \"'For your love is more delightful than wine' (Song of Song 1:2) - the words of the scribes are more beloved than the wine of Torah.\"", 
                "6": "<b>Raise up many disciples:</b> like the opinion of Beit Hillel.

They said [back] to him, 'Yes.' One of his students said to him, 'All of them are here except the smallest one.' He said to them, 'Let the small one come, who the generation in the future will follow.' And they brought Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai. Behold that one should not push off the small ones for the bigger ones, since the kids will become goats.\" And about this matter the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Yevamot 62b), \"'Sow your seed in the morning, and donâ€™t hold back your hand in the evening' (Ecclesiastes 11:6), - if you have raised disciples in your youth, raise disciples in your old age.\" Behold that the multiplication of disciples is a very good thing and a merit to the teacher."
