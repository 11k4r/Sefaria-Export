The word ‘in the tree’ teaches that the place was a forest and there were trees there, it is the place known as “the house of the forest of Lebanon” (Kings I 7:2) This is what David said regardingthe Divine Presence “…we found it in the fields of the forest.” (Psalms 132:6) Behold, it is in the portion of Benyamin, of which it is written “Benjamin is a wolf, he will prey…” (Genesis 49:27)",

The intention of the verse is that he defiles the Tabernacle and that Sanctuary as well, which is Knesset Yisrael, the Holy Temple above. On this the Rav (Ramban) wrote: “Because he defiled the Tabernacle of the Lord,” this is a hint to the Sanctuary of the Sanctuary. That is to say, to Knesset Yisrael which is the Sanctuary of the Sanctuary below and rests there. Or to Knesset Yisrael which is the Sanctuary to the Sanctuary above, which is the special name. Because the sanctuary below is aligned with that above, therefore it says Tabernacle and Sanctuary. So too it is written “I have surely built You a house to dwell in…” (Kings I 8:13) A House which is aligned with zevul. And we find an explicit verse regarding this “The built-up Jerusalem is like a city that was joined together within itself.” (Psalms 122:3) This is the linguistic secret embedded in the name Jerusalem (Yerushalayim) which is plural, like eyes (einayim), ears (oznayim) and the like. And the letter yud which is missing (in how the name Yerushalayim is written in the Bible) is the Holy Temple above, she is the last letter hey in the Divine name. Therefore you find Yerushalayim written in full (with the yud) five times in the Bible to hint to us that the hey is connected to her at a time of wholeness."

This is not happenstance but by complete design.  Through these [differences] Moshe taught us the ways of prayer and supplication –how a person who is praying should pray and how one who is beseeching should beseech, in order to be favoured by one’s Master. This is the reason why the thirteen attributes [of mercy] which were taught to him at Sinai were not [fully] mentioned here, but only six, with seven missing. He did not mention, “Hashem, G-d, merciful and compassionate,” because those apply only for ‎one who is primarily meritorious, and at this point, the majority of Israel were sinners.‎ He did not mention, “Hashem, G-d, merciful and compassionate,” because those apply only for ‎one who is primarily meritorious, and at this point, the majority of Israel were sinners. ‎He did not mention “and truth”, because truth would have found [the nation] liable, for [truth] is ‎the attribute of strict judgement, as taught by our sages: “Regarding truth, G-d does not go ‎beyond the law [to forgive].” (Avodah Zarah 4b). They believed the words of the spies, which ‎eliminated faith, and it was cut off from their mouths.‎‏ ‏He did not mention “granting kindness to ‎thousands [of generations]” because this time Moshe was not praying in the merit of the ‎ancestors, as they had just rejected the land that the ancestors had chosen. For the same reason, ‎he did not say, “Remember Avraham and Yitzchak,” as he had done following the making of the ‎golden calf, when he prayed for them in this trouble.‎‏ ‏And he did not mention “[forgiving of ‎accidental] sin,” because they had acted with intent.‎‏ ‏It was necessary [for Moshe] to include ‎‎“Hashem” in his prayer, as this was the first Name G-d mentioned to him in the thirteen attributes.‎",

This is similar to Tehillim 145:9, “Hashem is good to all, and His ‎mercy is upon all His creations.” But here “Hashem” is only mentioned once, and this is the ‎reference to “Hashem” [forgiving] after a sin, for here they were sinners who had not returned. ‎The meaning of “Hashem [forgiving] after a sin” is that there is not a change or activation after a ‎sin, as there is before a sin, which is not the case for a flesh and blood king."

If you say ‎that he had (the ability to effectively curse), how is it possible that flesh and blood could change a ‎decree of the Creator? For if the Creator decreed on Israel, \"For they are blessed (Bamidbar ‎‎22:12),\" how could (Bilaam)'s curse change what was already decreed? And if you will say there is ‎no substance in his curse, then why did G-d stop him, as it says, \"You shall not curse the nation ‎‎(Bamidbar 22:12)\"? Let Bilaam curse all day as long as G-d blesses (the Jewish people), like the ‎passage, \"They curse, and you bless (Tehillim 109:28)\"! ‎ The answer to this is that Bilaam did not have any power at all in his speech to effectuate a ‎blessing or curse. There is proof that the curses he expressed did not have power, from the fact ‎that the blessings he expressed did not have power. If he had power in his speech to bless, then ‎when it became clear to him that it was not the will of G-d to curse Israel as Balak had commanded ‎him, why didn’t he bless Balak and his nation? This would have completed the intent of Balak that ‎Israel should not rule over him. And why did he push himself into being rented for the silverv and ‎gold of Balak? Let him bless himself that he should become a great king over all the other kings, ‎and he wouldn’t need his (Balak‟s) silver and gold. Indeed, we find explicitly that he (Bilaam) ‎blessed himself in saying \"May my soul die the death of the upright (Bamidbar 23:10)\", and his ‎blessing was not fulfilled  – rather, his end was terrible and his hope turned into frustration, for he ‎died an abnormal death as it is written, \"And Bilaam the son of Beor the sorcerer, they killed with ‎the sword (Yehoshua 13:22).\"‎‎ We see that he did not have the power in his speech to curse through his words. However, in his ‎wisdom he knew how to figure out the time that G-d would become angry, and he definitely had ‎the power in his speech to curse.‎ Nonetheless, the question still stands in its place: We know that Hashem did not get angry in those ‎days (Brachot 7a), so all of his words and wisdom were nullified, the strength of his speech and ‎wisdom collapsed… So why didn’t (G-d) leave him to curse them? Why did He say to him, \"Do not ‎curse the nation (Bamidbar 22:12)\"?‎ The answer is that G-d knew of the plague that was to occur (see the end of the Parshat Balak), ‎and lest they say that the plague was because of Bilaam’s curse, He prevented him from cursing. ‎But, certainly, Bilaam did not have any power from the side of his speech to bless or to curse, only ‎from his wisdom in identifying the time when G-d would be angry.‎",

It need not even be mentioned that Israel in the wilderness knew this place through the forefathers, as the binding of Yitzchak took place there. In the Guide to the Perplexed (3, 45) the Rambam gave three explanations of why the text called it simply ‘the place’ and did not explicitly name it as Mount Moriah, famous and known to all. First - if the nations had known that there prayer is received and offerings find favor, each nation would have wanted to seize it, causing great struggle and bloodshed between the nations. Second – since the Canaanites dwelling in the land knew that in the future Israel would inherit their land and serve Gd and offer sacrifices in that place, they would have destroyed it to the extent that they could. Third – the tribes would have argued with each other, each one seeking that this place be included in his portion of the land. This would have caused dissension among them just as the desire for the priesthood did. Therefore the Torah hid this place and simply called it ‘the place.’ There is no need to mention that it was hidden from the nations, but rather even from Israel, because even though everyone knew the greatness of Mount Moriah they did not know that it was the place which the Lord would choose."

The idea of this Midrash is that all the creation in their entirety were creation at their request and desire, and the Holy One B\"H informed them in the beginning of the creation all of their [related] matters and all that would befall them in the future. And also informed them of the days of their lives and deaths, and how they would occur. And how they would sustain themselves if with spirit or difficult, if independently or with the aid of others. And so our Rabbis have explained that all of the process of creation was performed with its knowledge and with its characters it was created, as it says \"and all his legions\", and they accepted and desired all; and accordingly they [the Rabbis] said 'he was apportioned to fall from the time of the six days of creation'. And Nevertheless their is a great punishment for those that [surround?], and so we make a guardrail on our roofs.",
