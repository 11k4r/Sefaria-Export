He met one of the idolaters of the city where he arrived and said to him: \"how completely blind and ignorant you are to worship idols!\". The idolater asked him: \"And what do you worship?\". The ascetic answered \"I worship the Creator, the Omnipotent, the Sustainer of all, the One, the Provider of all, which there is none like Him\". The idolater countered \"your actions contradict your words!\" The ascetic asked \"How so?\", the idolater said \"if what you say were true, He would have provided a livelihood for you in your own city, just like He provided for you here, and it would not have been necessary for you to trouble yourself to travel to a faraway land like this.\" The ascetic, unable to answer, returned to his city and reassumed his asceticism from that time on, and never again left his city.",

(5) The difference between one who trusts in G-d in earning a livelihood and one who does not. (6) Obligation to refute those who promote delaying the service of G-d until reaching sufficient material prosperity. (7) Things that damage one's trust in G-d, and a summary of the matter of trust.", 
                "43": "Another benefit, peace of mind and body, due to sparing oneself from pursuing grueling jobs, and wearying occupations, avoiding work of kings - mingling in their culture and dealing with their corrupt servants.", 
                "24": "(3) The alchemist does not trust anyone with his secret due to fear for his life. But one who trusts G-d does not fear any man on account of his trust, just the contrary it is a source of honor, as King David said: \"in G-d I trusted, I will not fear, what can a man do to me?\" (Tehilim 54:12).", 
                "25": "(4) The alchemist must either prepare one large quantity of gold and silver for long term needs or must prepare small batches for short term needs. If he prepares a large quantity, all his days he will fear for his life that perhaps all the gold and silver will be lost in any number of ways (and he will be left penniless), and his heart will never quiet, nor will his mind be at peace due to fear of the king and of the people (finding his big stash of gold).If he makes small batches for short term use, it is possible that he will not successfully perform the procedure at a time of great need, due to a failure in one of the means. But one who trusts in G-d, has strong peace of mind that G-d will provide for him at any time He wishes and in any place, just like He sustains the fetus in its mother's womb or the chick inside an egg, which has no opening to enter anything from the outside, and birds in the air, or fish in the sea, and the tiny ant despite its weakness, while the mighty lion some days cannot obtain food, as written \"Young lions suffer want and are hungry, but those who seek the L-ord lack no good\" (Tehilim 34:11), and \"The L-ord will not starve the soul of the righteous\" (Mishlei 10:3), and \"I have been young, and now am old; yet I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread\" (Tehilim 37:25)", 
                "26": "(5) The alchemist is under anxiety and fear of everyone, from the greatest to the lowest of people as a consequence of his work, but one who trusts in G-d will be revered by great men and honorable people, even animals and stones seek to do his will (i.e. do not harm him - TL) as written in the entire Psalm \"He who sits...\" (tehilim 91), and \"In six troubles He will save you, and in the seventh no harm will touch you.\" (Iyov 5:19), until the end of the matter.", 
                "27": "(6) The alchemist is not immune from sickness and disease which hinders his joy in being wealthy, and prevents him from benefiting from what he has and enjoying what he has acquired. But one who trusts in G-d, is immune from sickness and disease except as an atonement or to increase his reward, as written \"Now youths shall become tired and weary, and young men shall stumble\" (Yeshaya 40:30), \"those who hope in G-d will renew strength\" (Yeshaya 40:31), and \"For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the L-ord supports the righteous\" (Tehilim 37:17).", 
                "20": "And he will be similar in his peace of mind, tranquility of heart, and few financial worries to the alchemist, one who knows how to transform silver to gold and copper or tin to silver through skill and procedures. ", 
                "21": "And the one who trusts in G-d will have the following 10 advantages over the alchemist:", 
                "22": "(1) The alchemist requires special materials to perform his operation, without which he cannot do anything. These materials are not found at all times and in all places. But for one who trusts in G-d, his sustenance is assured and can come through any means of all the means of the world, as written \"[And He fed you with manna, which you knew not, neither did your fathers know]; That He might make known to you that man does not live by bread alone...\" (Devarim 8:3). For at no time and in no place are the means of obtaining his livelihood withheld from him, as you know already from the story of Eliyahu and the ravens, or with the widow and the cakes and water (Melachim 17:9), or the story of Ovadia with the prophets, where he said \"I hid among the prophets of G-d, 100 men, 50 in each cave, and I fed them bread and water\" (Melachim 18:13) , and \"Young lions suffer want and are hungry, but those who seek the L-ord lack no good\" (Tehilim 34:11), and \"Fear the L-ord, His holy ones; for there is no want to those who fear Him\" (Tehilim 34:10).", 
                "23": "(2) The alchemist must perform actions and follow procedures without which he cannot successfully complete his goal. It is even possible that the fumes and odors will cause his death, along with the long work and great effort with them day and night. But one who trusts in G-d is secure against mishaps, and his heart is assured against future (potential) bad things. Whatever comes to him from G-d, he will accept with joy and gladness and his livelihood comes to him peacefully, quietly, and happily, as written \"He causes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters\" (Tehilim 23:2). ", 
                "46": "Another benefit, joy in whatever happens to him, even if it is something difficult and against his nature, because he trusts that G-d will do only what is good for him in all matters, just like a mother has compassion on her baby in washing it, diapering it, and tying or untying it against its will, as David said \"Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child\" (Tehilim 131:2). ", 
                "47": "Since I have clarified the benefits of trust in G-d for religious and secular matters, I will now clarify seven topics on the matter of trust:", 
                "44": "But one who trusts G-d, selects among the different occupations one which is easy on his body, allows him to earn a good reputation, does not consume his mind, and is best suited for fulfilling his torah obligations and the principles of his faith, because the choice of occupation will neither increase nor decrease the income he will earn unless G-d decreed so, as it says \"For it is not from the east or from the west, neither from the desert does elevation come. But G-d judges; He lowers this one and elevates that one.\" (Tehilim 75:7), and \"He causes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters\" (Tehilim 23:2).", 
                "45": "Another benefit, minimal aggravation in one's business dealings. If one's merchandise does not sell, or if he is unable to collect his debts, or if he is struck by illness, because he knows that the Creator is in charge of his life and knows best what is good for him, as written \"Only to G-d should you hope, my soul, for my hope is from Him\" (Tehilim 62:6).", 
                "28": "(7) It is possible that the alchemist will not be able to buy food with his gold and silver due to no food being available in the city at times, as written: \"they shall cast their money in the streets\" (Yechezkel 7:19), and \"neither silver nor gold will be able to save them\" (Tzefania 1:18), but for one who trusts in G-d, his sustenance will not be blocked at any time or in any place, as written \"in famine He redeemed you from death\" (Iyov 5:20), and \"the L-ord is my shepherd, I shall not lack\" (Tehilim 23:1), and \"They will not be shamed in time of calamity, and in days of famine they shall still be satisfied\" (Tehilim 37:19).", 
                "29": "(8) The alchemist does not linger in one place too long due to fear that his secret will be discovered. But one who trusts in G-d feels secure in his land, and has peace of mind in his place, as written \"Trust in the L-ord and do good; dwell in the land and be nourished by faith\" (Tehilim 37:3), and \"The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell forever in it\" (Tehilim 37:29).",

[It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves stay green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit]\" (Yirmiyahu 17:8).",

                "3": "If he places his trust in his wisdom and tactics, physical strength and industriousness - he will toil for nothing, his strength will weaken, and his tactics will fall short of accomplishing his desire, as written \"He traps the wise with their own cunning\" (Iyov 5:13) , and \"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race does not belong to the swift, nor the war to the mighty; neither do the wise have bread, [nor do the understanding have wealth, nor the knowledgeable, favor for time and chance happens to them all]\" (Koheles 9:11), and \"Young lions suffer want and are hungry, but those who seek the L-ord lack no good\" (Tehilim 34:11). ", 
                "2": "Among them, peace of mind, and trusting in G-d as a servant must trust in his master, because if one does not place his trust in G-d, he will place his trust in something else, and whoever trusts in something other than G-d, the Al-mighty will remove His providence from such a person, and leave him in the hands of the one he trusted, and he will be as it was written: \"For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the spring of living waters, to dig for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that do not hold water\" (Yirmiya 2:13), \"They exchanged their Glory for the likeness of an ox eating grass\" (Tehilim 106:20),\"Blessed is the man who trusts in the L-ord; the L-ord shall be his refuge\" (Yirmiya 17:7), \"Praiseworthy is the man who made the L-ord his trust, and did not turn to the haughty and those who turn to falsehood.\" (Tehilim 40:5), \"Cursed is the man who trusts in man, who makes flesh his strength and whose heart turns away from the L-ord\" (Yirmiya 17:5).

And it is possible that the money will be the cause of his destruction (in this world) and ultimate downfall (in the afterlife) as written \"There is a grievous evil that I saw under the sun; riches kept by their owner for his harm.\" (Koheles 5:12).

They would ask him \"what is dispersion of the mind?\" He would answer: \"to own property at the head of every river and the center of every town.\" And this is what our sages referred to in saying: \"the more possessions, the more worry\" (Avos 2:7), and they said: \"who is wealthy?

And likewise, the way of punishments for hidden and revealed misdeeds, is similar to the way of reward.  ",

This is explained in parsha Bechukosai \"If you will go in My ways..\" (Vayikra 26), and likewise, for visible sins, visible and swift punishment in this world, because the masses understand only that which is visible not that which is hidden, as written: \"the hidden things belong to G-d, but the revealed things belong to us and to our children, forever\" (Devarim 29:28). And the verse says \"if the people will turn their eyes away from the [evil] acts of this man and his family, I will turn My face to this man and his family\" (Vayikra 20:4). Hence, the reward and punishment for the fulfillment or transgression of the duties of the heart belongs to the Creator. Therefore, Scripture omitted an explanation of their reward and punishment in the next world. (see Tov Halevanon for more details)",

Rather he is deemed by G-d worthy of it due to two things besides his good deeds. (1) That he teaches other people the service of G-d, and guides them to do good, as written \"they who bring merit to the public shall be as the stars forever\" (Daniel 12:3). And also, \"to them that rebuke shall be delight, and on them will come the blessing of the good\" (Mishlei 24:25). And when the industrious man will combine the reward for those who he brought merit, with the reward for his own good deeds, and the reward for the faith in his heart and patient acceptance [of G-d's will] - he will be deemed by the Creator worthy of the reward of Olam Haba. (i.e. if he also brings merit to others in addition to his own piety, then certainly he is worthy of the reward, as written: \"to them that rebuke shall be delight\" - ML) ",

He will think little of the sweetness of pleasures which he had earlier been so eager to run towards. This kind of education was a kindness toward him. (i.e. this conduct to motivate him initially through sweet things, etc. as before, was due to the father's mercy on him - PL) ", 
                    "101": "Similarly, the Creator encouraged his people with promises of rewards and threatened them with punishments that would come soon [i.e. in this world - PL] because He knew that after they would be strongly established in the service, their foolishness regarding reward and punishment here on earth would shed (i.e. that which they served primarily for reward in this world [would shed] - PL) and their intent in the service would be to Him, and they would direct their conduct for Him. And in this way, we can explain all of the physical forms ascribed to the Creator in scripture. ", 
                    "106": "Another reason, is that good deeds are of two categories. (1) Those concealed from others, and visible only to the Creator, like the duties of the heart, and other similar duties.",

                    "104": "The reason for this, is that even if a man's good deeds are numerous like the sand of the seashore, it would not weigh enough to cover even one favor the Creator had bestowed on him in this world. All the more so, if he has committed any sins, because if the Creator will hold a man strictly to account for his obligation of gratitude, all of his good deeds would be cancelled and wiped out by even the smallest favor the Creator has done for him, and that which the Creator owes him will not amount to anything. Hence, that which the Creator rewards a person for his good deeds is to be regarded as a Divine grace to him. ", 
                    "105": "The punishment in both worlds, however, is through truth and justice, and it is a debt a man must pay.

Rather, he should thank the Creator who provided for him after his labor, and that He did not make his work and struggle result in nothing, as written \"If you eat the toil of your hands, you are praiseworthy, and it is good for you\" (Tehilim 128:2).",

Then, when a farmer must plow his field, clear it from weeds, and to sow it, and water it, when rainwater is not available, let him trust in the Creator to make it fertile, and to protect it from plagues, to increase and to bless the crops.

If he is a stranger, let his companionship be with G-d during his time of loneliness, and trust in Him during his period of being a stranger. And let him contemplate that the soul is also a stranger in this world, and that all people are like strangers here, as the verse says \"because you are strangers and temporary residents with Me\" (Vayikra 25:23).

As to your noticing that we separated ourselves from women and children, know that we prepared for them a village near here. When one of us needs something from them, he goes to them and after obtaining his wants, returns to us. This we did because we saw how much distraction of the heart, great loss, and great exertion and strain there was when they were among us, and the great peace of mind from all of this, in separating from them, to focus on matters of the afterlife and to be repulsed by matters of this world.

One day he inquired to the scribe: \"how are things?\" He answered \"good, as long as my hand is still in good shape.\" Then, that evening his hand was crushed, and he could not write with it for the rest of his life. This was his punishment from G-d, in that he placed his trust in his hand. (to atone for him. Note that he must have been at a very high level of piety, therefore G-d paid him in this world even for minute sins so as to spare him from any punishments in the next world) ", 
                    "13": "(7) If his knowledge of G-d strengthens more, he will put his trust in G-d in matters where he has some plan, such as avoiding earning a livelihood through dangerous means or exhausting occupations that wear down the body, and trusts in G-d that He will provide for him through a lighter occupation.", 
                    "12": "(6) But when his wisdom grows and he realizes their lacking and their need for the Creator, he will then move his trust to G-d, and rely on Him for things beyond his own control and which he cannot escape submitting to the decree of G-d, such as the falling of rainwater on the crops, or (safely) traveling through the sea, or crossing a barren desert, floods, outbreak of a plague among the living, or the like among matters which human beings have no plan whatsoever, as written \"In the time of their trouble they will cry out: 'arise and save us' \" (Yirmiyahu 2:27).", 
                    "15": "(9) If his knowledge of G-d strengthens more regarding His mercy on the created beings, he will accept with heart and mind, outwardly and inwardly, the decrees of G-d. He will rejoice in whatever G-d does to him, be it death or life, poverty or wealth, health or sickness. He will not desire other than what G-d has chosen for him, and desire only what G-d has chosen for him. ", 
                    "14": "(8) If his knowledge of G-d strengthens more, he will put his trust in G-d in all the means, whether difficult or easy, and while occupied in them, his intent will be directed to serve G-d and guard His commandments. ", 
                    "17": "(10) When his knowledge of G-d strengthens more than this and he understands the true intent why he was created and brought to this fleeting world, and he recognizes the exaltedness of the eternal, next world, he will think lightly of this world, and its means. With mind, soul, and body, he will flee from this world and surrender himself to the blessed Al-mighty, and delight in remembering Him in solitude. He will feel desolate when he is not (capable of - MC) meditating on His greatness. ", 
                    "16": "He will give himself over to G-d, and surrender his body and soul over to His judgment. He will not prefer one matter over another and will not choose anything other than his current situation, as one who trusts in G-d said \"I never resolved to do a thing and desired something else\". ", 
                    "19": "This is the highest of the levels of those who trust in G-d, reached by the prophets, pious ones, and treasured, pure men of G-d, and this is what the verse refers to in saying \"Even [for] the way of Your judgments, O L-ord, have we hoped for You; for Your Name and for Your remembrance is the desire of [our] soul directed.\" (Yeshaya 26:8), and \"my soul thirsts to the Al-mighty, the living G-d; [when shall I come and appear before G-d?]\" (Tehilim 42:3).", 
                    "18": "If he is among a crowd of people, he will long for nothing else than to do His will, and yearn only to come near to Him. His joy in his love of G-d will distract him from the pleasures worldly people have for this world, and even from the joy of souls in the next world. "
