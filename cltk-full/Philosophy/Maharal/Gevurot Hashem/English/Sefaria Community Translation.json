            "0": "...Author's introduction",
            "1": "...First Introduction: \"It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a matter\" (Proverbs 25:2). We find in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabba, Ch. 9): Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Chama bar Chanina said: From the beginning of the book of Bereshit until \"and he completed\" it is the glory of God to conceal a thing.\" Concerning the remaining parts of the Torah, \"search a matter out.\" Since a person's understanding is subjective, (relative to the person) the concept being studied cannot be completely unrelated to the subjective world of the student. Were a perception completely unrelated to the human being, it would not be fit for human analysis. For this reason the Torah does not openly speak of the world to come or the immortality of the soul. If the Torah were the work of a ruler of flesh and blood concerned to warn his subjects not to disobey his commands, no doubt these things would be mentioned. The concepts 'world to come' and 'garden of Eden' would be used as incentives to ensure that his will is followed. Those who obey him would be guaranteed-a share in the 'garden of Eden' and those who disregard his will would be threatened with dire punishment. However the Torah work of the living God transmitted to us by the prophet. therefore the topics dealt with are relative to the comprehension of the prophet. 'The world to come' and 'immortality' are Nivdal. set apart from corporeal man and having no existence within, the world presently accessible to him; consequently any concepts we can formulate about them must be remote and apart from human comprehension; and a prophet cannot consider anything that is beyond human reach. In this respect, there is a difference between wisdom and prophecy. The scholar comprehending through intellect can grasp the most abstract and esoteric concepts. The prophet on the other hand is called a \"seer\" or \"man of vision\". Since his prophecy shares its characteristics with his external vision and viewpoint, he must have some experiential connection with the object of his prophecy.",
            "2": "Therefore our sages have taught (Baba Batrah 12a) a sage is better than prophet. And the explanation is that prophecy is like seeing in the eye whereas the object is outside, and even though the prophecy isn't tangible feeling, it's still like feeling related to the object, the prophecy power of the prophet, which is visioning power or other power of accepting the prophecy, is related to the object the prophecy is about."

                "6": "And the Shabbat before Passover is called Shabbat haGadol, and many words have come about this, but none explain it except that we read as a haftara that day \"And they will be pleasing to haShem\" (Malachi 3:4-24) and there it says (Malachi 3:23) \"before the coming of the great [haGadol] and the awesome day of haShem:\" For this reason it is called Shabbat haGadol. And the explanation that the Exodus from Egypt was called great on account of the greatness of God's awesome acts that God did and acted when they left Egypt, and in the future, in the world to come, Israel will aquire even higher levels, and the Holy Blessed One will do even greater deeds than all the great deeds, and even more awesome than all the awesome deeds. And as Israel merited the level of the Exodus from Egypt when great deeds were done with them, they will merit an even higher level and and deeds will be done in the n world to come. And thus the Shabbat before Passover is called Shabbat haGadol, for every Shabbat is a source and remembrance of the world to come which is called Shabbat as well, and thus the Shabbat preceding Pesach is a remembrance of the great Shabbat that will be the \"great and the awesome day of haShem.\" And thus the Shabbat before the Day of Atonement is called Shabbat Tshuvah [repentance/returning], and this is because the Day of Atonement is a day of repentance/returning, for all return to their original inheritance by the forgiveness of the Holy Blessed One who forvices them, and they return to haShem and this is known, and thus the Torah determined the jubilee on the Day of Atonement for all return to their original inheritance, and the day of Atonement is similar to this, for they repent/return from the iniquities that were upon them and return to haShem, and in the future when every day will be Shabbat all return to haShem at the diminishing of thus world, and this will be by the merit of the Day of Atonement that they now return to haShem, thus they will merit to repent/return on that Shabbat to haShem. And since every Shabbat is a source of the world to come and a remembrance of it, thus the Shabbat preceding the Day of Atonement is a source for the Shabbat on which all will return to haShem, and obviously it's the Shabbat before and not the Shabbat after, for that Shabbat is first and higher. And since the Shabbat of the future of the world to come belongs to the Day of Atonement as we said, our Shabbat is an allegory for it belonging solely to the Shabbat before it, and not the Shabbat after the Day of Atonement for the Day of Atonement has already passed and this is clear. And thus for the matter of Shabbat haGadol, and look, it is made clear that the Shabbat before Passover we can call it Shabbat haGadol for Passover is great, as above, and the Shabbat relying on it is the Shabbat even more magnified and blessed, for it is all the more the great and awesome day, and understand well that this is correct and there is no doubt for understanding it."

                "4": "5 And furthermore you should know, that when the Holy One brought the plagues upon Egypt, he struck them in all divisions of the world, for just as we have said that the plagues came upon them from below, above, and in the hollow (on the surface) of the world, so too they came upon them in all the divisions of the world. There are ten divisions to the world and they are the ten divisions that the Holy One created in the six days of creation. Each division had its own statement and these are the ten statements with which the world was created, for \"Bereishit\" was also a statement as is stated in Masechet Rosh Hashana (32a). Even though the plagues did not come upon them in the order fo the statement with which the Holy One created the world for each one has its own order, that is because with regards to the plagues, each plague was always more severe than the previous on for you wouldn't make one severe plague followed by one that is not as severe. Therefore they went from least to most (severe) and this is what causes the change in the order of the statements. Still, you will find clearly that all of these plagues corresponded to the ten statements. Because of this you will find in the final statement (Bereishit 1:29) \"And G-d said, Behold I have given you all seed bearing herbs... to eat.\" This is the tenth statement that G-d gave living beings their sustenance and food since food upon consumption becomes blood, and when they become blood, the animal is sustained. G-d altered this statement by making the river blood for just as this statement would have been nullified if the creation of blood, their sustenance, had been removed, so too it is considered lost and destroyed when there is an increase in blood for all addition and all subtraction are equal. The second plague, Frogs, corresponds to the statement \"\"Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures.\" This nullified the statement \"swarming of living creatures\" for there was addition here and addition and subtraction are equal for it is called striking it when there is a departure from the order (created by) of the statement and here was a change from the natural order. The third plague, Lice, that the dirt became lice struck at the statement \"\"Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear,\" and now the dry land was struck that the dirt of the land turned to lice. \"Afar\" (dirt) (of the land) refers to an area fit for habitation. The rest of the land is called \"Eretz\", but \"Afar\" refers to inhabited land is clear in Perek Kisuy Hadam (Chullin 88b). Wild Animals corresponds to \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures,\" that G-d altered this statement to the point that they became completely destructive. Pestilence corresponds to \"\"Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens.\" It is agreed upon by researchers that renewed pestilence comes from sparks from the stars that become renewed in their visibility. From them come changes in the air and thickness from star sparks - so say the researchers. Therefore, the pestilence that came upon strikes at the statement \"Let there be luminaries.\" Boils was a plague against \"Let us make man in our image,\" for we have already explained earlier that boils was a plague that attached itself to man and we don't fine any that attached themselves to man except this one. And since it is written, \"Let us make man in our image - in the image of G-d He created man,\" and with the plague of boils their form and mold was changed, that they no longer had their shape and visage because of the boils attached to them, for the boils destroyed the image of the person that they no longer had a shape and form. For this reason, the sorcerers were embarrassed to stand before Moshe and Aharon when the boils came upon them. Hail corresponded to \"Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water.\" With this statement, an additional action occurred in the sky and hail came from it in an unnatural way. This was a change in the statement \"Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water,\" for from the skies came hail. Locusts corresponded to \"Let the earth sprout... fruit trees producing fruit,\" for the locusts were a destruction of this statement specifically, for locusts are more capable than any other insect in destroying fruit as is written (Devarim 28:38), \"The field will produce much seed, but you will gather little for the locusts will consume it,\" and it also says, \"All your trees and fruit of your land will be inherited by locusts.\" From here you see that Locust are specific in their ability to destroy tree and fruit. Even though the hail also struck the trees of the field, it wasn't specific to the trees of the field for it also struck animals and people. But the locusts were specific to the trees and fruit. Darkness struck at the statement, \"Let there be light.\" The Plague of the Firstborns corresponds to the statement of \"Bereishit,\" for a firstborn is the first of those that come after it and it corresponds to the statement of Bereishis which was the beginning of creation as well. They are both beginnings. Just as the plague of the firstborns was equal to all the other plagues, so too, the statement of \"Bereishis,\" was equal to all the other statement - so we find in the Midrash.
