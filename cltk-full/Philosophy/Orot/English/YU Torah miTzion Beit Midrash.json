[It is possible] only through the ‎Divine spirit which rests upon the nation as a whole, a natural spiritual imprint within the Israelite ‎soul, sending forth its radiance in natural colours through all of the paths of healthy sensation, and ‎shining its higher illumination according to that higher sacred spirit which fills with life and higher ‎beauty the hearts of those of holy conception and deep Israelite thought.‎",

This foundation is rotten, compared to the sacred strength of the Land of Israel. True ‎strengthening of the Jewish idea in exile will only come via deep embedding in the Land of Israel; ‎via yearning for the Land of Israel, [the Jewish idea] will continually receive all of its independent ‎traits.‎",
