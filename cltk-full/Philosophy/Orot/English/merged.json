It is only through the divine spirit which is on the nation as a whole, through the natural spiritual nature which exists in the soul of Israel, which spreads out through ",

This foundation is rotten, compared to the sacred strength of the Land of Israel. True ‎strengthening of the Jewish idea in exile will only come via deep embedding in the Land of Israel; ‎via yearning for the Land of Israel, [the Jewish idea] will continually receive all of its independent ‎traits.‎",

This is a disaster against which we must battle, with counsel and understanding, with sanctity and with might.\n"

The belief of God affirms human beings only as the same degree that divine greatness is explored and learned from that important part of them, which it deserves. Then the soul shines from the upper light by joining love and a complete view of life, and all feelings, opinions and actions are noted.
