Rather, the light is wrapped within [this manifestation of holiness] and [clings] to it like a garment. The noble strands that emerge from these [rectifications are] practical details directed toward the rectification of the state and [of each individual’s physical] health, in the form of Godly commandments. These may be compared to <i>tzitzit</i>. And the culture as a whole may be compared to the <i>tallit</i>. The <i>tzitzit</i> bring forth a holy revelation of all of the light hidden in the entire <i>tallit</i>, with [the light’s] great revelation and manifestation. [Similarly, the] deeds of Godly commandments and holiness that make [their particular] mark in the totality of human action, [deeds] directed toward rectifying [man’s] life – communal and individual –actualize the light hidden in the depths of all the structures of human culture. They bring the revelations [of that light] to the place fit for [the light] and make visible the light of eternal life that gives life to everything, including temporary life."

But the <i>ruach</i> is much more perfected in those who fear God and who keep the Torah and the commandments, even though an intrinsic sensitivity and impulse to act in matters concerning the whole of Israel are not yet as strong in them as they are in those in whom a spirit of transgression fouls their heart to such a degree that they connect themselves to foreign perspectives and to deeds that pollute their physicality and prevent the light of the <i>ruach</i> from being rectified [in them]. As a result, the <i>nefesh</i> [of these sinners] too suffers from their blemishes. The rectification – which will come about via the light of the Messiah [and] which will be greatly aided by the spreading forth of the teaching of the secrets of the Torah and the revelation of the lights of the wisdom of God in all of its forms that are worthy of being revealed – is that Israel will come together in one bond. And [then] the <i>nefesh</i> of those who are [God-]fearing, who keep the Torah, will be rectified by means of the perfected <i>nefesh</i> of the sinners, who are good in regard to matters of the entire [community] and [in regard to] the hopes, material and spiritual, that can be understood by human awareness and sensitivity. And the <i>ruach</i> of the sinners will be rectified by means of the influence of those who fear God, who keep the Torah and who are great in faith. And thus a great light will come to both [groups]. The manifestation of complete <i>teshuvah</i> will come to the world, and then the people of Israel will be prepared for redemption. The supernal <i>tzadikim</i>, the masters of the <i>neshamah</i>, will be the unifying conduits through which the abundant flow of the light of the <i>nefesh</i> will pass from left to right and the abundant flow of the light of the <i>ruach</i> from right to left. And the joy will be very great. “Your priests will don righteousness and Your pious ones will sing joyfully” (Psalms 132:9). And this will be accomplished through the power of the light of the Messiah, who is David himself, who “lifted up the yoke of <i>teshuvah</i>” (Moed Katan 16b). “For the sake of David Your servant, do not reject the face of your anointed one” (Psalms 132:10)."
