Rabbi Aha bar Hanina reports that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The halakhah is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai. [The Gemara continues] There are those who teach that the statement of Rabbi Aha bar Hanina that in a baraita Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai says according to Rabbi Akiva sometimes a man reads the Shema two times in the day, once before the sunrise and once after the sunrise and fulfills his obligation for the day and the night [reading of Shema]. Rabbi Aha bar Hanina says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi that the halakhah is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai. Rabbi Zera says: as long as he does not say Hashkivenu  - all of this is halakhah. Rabbi Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai that fulfilling the obligation until dawn is bedieved and if he willfully reads the Shema before the dawn he has fulfilled his obligation even though this is not permitted.

If sleep catches him, he will sleep the entire night. Rather, a man should come from the field in the evening and go to the beit knesset or to the beit midrash. If he is used to reading the Torah, he should read it and if he is used to learning, he should learn. And after he recites the Shema and prays. All who disregard the words of the Sages are liable for the death penalty. This is what Rabbi Shimon said about the times that a man recites the Shema of the evening before sunrise is only in cases of duress, such as one who was drunk or ill. ",
