However, in the Yerushalmi it says, if you want to be stringent, we don't let him. Therefore, it appears to say, one does not bless and one is not permitted to bless, and the Yerushalmi explains why, and says because of Kavod HaMeit (respect for the dead). Alternatively, because he doesn't have anyone who will carry his burden. We ask a question: but isn't it taught in a Braita: exempt from netilat lulav. And should you think we are dealing with Yom Tov, and there he is not too busy to carry the burden, and we teach that it is referring to Chol, meaning Chol HaMoed [because he could potentially bury on Chol]. But isn't it taught in a Braita: 'Exempt from the blowing of the shofar'. It should have said on a weekday and not on Yom Tov. And that's a question. And we answer: Rav Chanina said, since he needs to prepare the casket and the shrouds [which the dead wear], as it is taught in a Mishnah: \"you may violate the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds\" its as if he is carrying the burden. Consequently, the implication is that on shabbat and yom tov you are not permitted to make blessings and pray since you are busy violating the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds. But there is a question from the end where it says \"on shabbat you make blessings and a mezuman. "

                "0": "If he erred and did not pray mincha on Friday etc.; He erred and did not pray mincha on shabbat he prays at arbit twice.  This is to say, on Saturday night, and he says havdalah in the first, etc.   Rabeinu Yehuda wrote that if he erred and did not mention Rosh Chodesh at mincha he should not pray an extra time in the evening, for what will this accomplish? He already prayed mincha, he just forgot to add [yaaleh ve'yavoh for] Rosh Chodesh. If so, he does not gain anything if he prays an extra time in the evening after Rosh Chodesh has ended, since he will not mention Rosh Chodesh [in the extra prayer], and he has already prayed Amida. And this is different than the case here, where one erred and did not pray mincha on shabbat [at all], where in the evening he prays an extra time using the Amida of a regular evening, since here he did not pray at all so at least he gains the extra amida when he prays after shabbat ends in the evening, even though he is not mentioning shabbat.  And if you will ask, isn't he praying more than required since on shabbat there were only seven blessings and he will pray 18? There is no reason to worry about this, since even on shabbat it would be appropriate to pray all 18, but this was not required because of the extra effort it would require. We find, then, that he gains the full extra prayer. But when he erred and did not mention Rosh Chodesh, he has already prayed, so praying an additional time on Saturday evening will yield nothing.  And similarly, if he prayed a regular weekday amida at mincha on shabbat, and did not mention shabbat, it would seem that he should not pray again Saturday evening since he already said the amida. However, Rav Alfas [the Rif] does not seem to maintain this position, and in this case even though he does not gain anything he requires an extra prayer. To quote him: \"With regard to the statement 'make havdalah in the first one and not in the second one, and if you did not say havdalah in the first one but did say havdalah in the second one, the second counts but the first does not count', since he needed to say the second one first; since he did not say havdalah in the first one but said havdalah in the second one, he has shown his intention that the second one should be his normal prayer. Therefore, he must pray again another time for his make-up prayer so that the obligatory prayer precedes the make-up.  And if he said havdalah in both of them, even though he was not required to do so, he does not need to repeat. And if he did not say havdalah in either of them, we do not make him repeat, as we learn in a braita 'if on erred and did not say havdalah in He Who grants us wisdom, we do not make him repeat since he can say havdalah on the cup of wine'\".  Therefore, we require him to pray again even though he will not gain anything additional the second time. This is what Rabbi Moshe Malavar concluded from the words of Rabbi Alfas. "

But in chapter Hakometz it says, \"if he did not talk he says one blessing, if he talked he says two blessings.\" Rashi explained that it says so on both Tefillin, that he says one blessing on both of them if he did not talk in between them, but it is difficult to say that the two blessings of \"to lay\" and \"concerning the precept\" were only needed when he talked and did a transgression. Therefore Rabbeinu Tam explained that on that of the head, which is the finishing of the commandment and the main part, because it has four compartments and the letter Shin, he says on it (an additional blessing of) \"on the precept,\" and this is (how it appears) in Shimusha Rabba, authored by the Ge'onim. And according to the explanation of Rabbeinu Tam regarding \"if he talked he says two blessings,\" (it refers to) if he puts on that of the head alone, since they (the two Tefillin) do not hold back each other  (from letting the wearer fulfill a commandment from it), he says two blessings. And this that the Gemara doesn't mention that on that of the head he says two blessings, it is because it is not at all common to place one without placing the other, since Tefillin by one with an obligation is common. And Rabbeinu Tam explained like this in his Responsa, and Rabbeinu Elchanan, in his \"Order of the enactment of prayer,\" wrote like this."
