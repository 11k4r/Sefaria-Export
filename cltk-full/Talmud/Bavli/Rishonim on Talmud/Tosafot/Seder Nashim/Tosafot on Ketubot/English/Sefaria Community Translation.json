The principle of justice is lacking here! Rather, what Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi must mean is that each of the dinars that they are owed have equal power. Therefore, the estate of the deceased is divided into six. The one owed one hundred takes one part, the one owed two hundred takes two parts, and the one owed three hundred takes three parts. Each of them claims according to the money owed to her until they come as close as possible to being payed. This is justice, and this is what he must have meant. "
