Judah may still be of the opinion [that partners in a sacrifice must perform laying on of hands] but he derives the cases both of the sacrifice of a gentile and a fellow's sacrifice from the one text. There is left over therefore one text, from which we derive that partners in a sacrifice must perform laying on of hands. ",
