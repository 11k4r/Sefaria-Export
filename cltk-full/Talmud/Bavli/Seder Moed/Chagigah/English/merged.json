            "17": "The Gemara proves that it is acceptable to borrow vessels from an <span class=\"it-text\">am</span> <span class=\"it-text\">ha’aretz</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class=\"it-text\">Eduyyot</span> 1:14): <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">An earthenware vessel </span>of an <span class=\"it-text\">am</span> <span class=\"it-text\">ha’aretz</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shields </span>all kinds of items from the ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. There are two applications of this fact: If there are objects or foods inside a tightly sealed earthenware vessel located inside a room containing a corpse, the vessel prevents the impurity from reaching the items inside it. Also, if there is a corpse in the first floor of a house and food or vessels are located in a second story of the same building, with an opening such as a skylight in the floor between the two stories, an earthenware vessel plugging up the opening will prevent the ritual impurity from spreading to the second story. This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the statement of Beit Hillel. Beit </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shammai say: It shields only food, drink</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and earthenware</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> vessels, </span>but not utensils of metal, wood, cloth, etc.", 
            "16": "§ We have established that the reason for leniency with regard to immersing one vessel inside another for <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> is based on the fact that we do not care if the vessels <span class=\"it-text\">amei</span> <span class=\"it-text\">ha’aretz</span> use for <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> are improperly purified, since we do not accept <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> from them in any event.

It should therefore be a matter of concern for us if those vessels are not properly purified.", 
            "18": "The mishna continues: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: For what </span>reason do you make this distinction? It is clear that a closed, pure earthenware vessel serves as a barrier, blocking the spread of impurity in a room with a corpse (see Numbers 19:15). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Shammai said </span>to them: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Because </span>the earthenware vessel itself <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is impure on account of </span>its contact with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">am</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ha’aretz</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>The Sages decreed that anything touched by an <span class=\"it-text\">am</span> <span class=\"it-text\">ha’aretz</span> is impure, since such people are not meticulous or sufficiently knowledgeable about the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of purity; therefore his vessels are considered impure. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the principle is that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an impure vessel does not serve as </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a barrier </span>from impurity. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Hillel said to them: But </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">didn’t you declare the food and drink inside </span>the earthenware vessel to be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pure? </span>If the vessel of an <span class=\"it-text\">am</span> <span class=\"it-text\">ha’aretz</span> cannot serve as a barrier, why do you say that some items inside it are pure? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shammai said to them: When we declared the food and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">drink inside it to be pure, </span>",

The Gemara answers: It is referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to something that would</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not last until the </span>next <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pilgrimage Festival, </span>but which would spoil beforehand.

The examination referred to in the mishna, then, is referring to ascertaining whether a particular <span class=\"it-text\">beit</span> <span class=\"it-text\">haperas</span> has been trodden or not. The reason for this leniency is that the impure status of a <span class=\"it-text\">beit</span> <span class=\"it-text\">haperas</span> is only a rabbinical decree, and the Sages <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not uphold their words </span>decreeing the field to be impure <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in a place </span>where this affects one’s ability to perform a mitzva involving <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">; </span>and failure to bring a paschal offering is punishable by <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>.",

A <span class=\"it-text\">beit</span> <span class=\"it-text\">haperas</span> is a patch of ground with a grave in it that was subsequently plowed over. The Sages were concerned that there might be small pieces of human bone scattered in the field, which would impart impurity to anyone moving them with his foot. Therefore, they decreed that whoever traverses such a field becomes impure. However, the Sages allowed one to pass through the field while maintaining his purity if he blows on the ground as he goes, the assumption being that any small pieces of bone would thereby be blown out of his path. This is the examination to which this mishna refers.
