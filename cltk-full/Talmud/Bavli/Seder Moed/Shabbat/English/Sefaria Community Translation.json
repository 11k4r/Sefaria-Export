He who is born under the constellation of the sun will be a distinguished (bright and handsome) man: he will eat and drink of his own and his secrets will lie uncovered; if a thief, he will have no success. He who is born under Venus will be wealthy and unchaste [immoral]. What is the reason? Because fire was created therein. He who is born under Mercury will be of a retentive memory and wise. What is the reason? Because it [Mercury] is the sun’s scribe. He who is born under the Moon will be a man to suffer evil, building and demolishing, demolishing and building. eating and drinking that which is not his and his secrets will remain hidden: if a thief, he will be successful. He who is born under Saturn will be a man whose plans will be frustrated. Others say: All [nefarious] designs against him will be frustrated. He who is born under Tzedek [Jupiter] will be a right-doing man [tzaddik] Rabbi Nahman ben Isaac observed: ‘He who is born under Mars will be a shedder of blood. Rabbi Ashi observed: Either a surgeon, a thief, a slaughterer, or a ‘mohel’ (a performer of ritual circumcision). Rabbah said: I was born under Mars.

Shall we say, without one virtue? Surely Rabbi Ashi said: I was born on the first day of the week! Hence it must surely mean, one vice. But Surely Rabbi Ashi said: I and Dimi ben Kakuzta were born on the first day of the week: I am a king (head of the academy) and he is the captain of thieves! Rather it means either completely virtuous or completely wicked. [What is the reason? Because light and darkness were created on that day.] He who is born on the second day of the week will be bad-tempered. What is the reason? Because the waters were divided thereon so will he be estranged from other people through his temper. He who is born on the third day of the week will be wealthy and unchaste. What is the reason? Because herbs were created thereon. (Herbs multiply very rapidly and also continually intermingle with other herbs.) He who is born on the fourth day of the week will be wise and of a retentive memory. What is the reason? Because the luminaries were suspended [thereon]. He who is born on the fifth day of the week will be generous. What is the reason? Because the fish and birds were created thereon. [Which are fed by God’s loving kindness.] He who is born on the eve of the Sabbath will be a seeker. Rabbi Nahman ben Isaac commented: A seeker after good deeds. He who is born on the Sabbath will die on the Sabbath, because the great day of the Sabbath was desecrated on his account. Raba son of Rabbi Shila observed: And he shall be called a great and holy man.",

You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised....\" [Habakkuk 2:16]: \"You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor\": That is Nevuchadnezzar. \"You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised\": That is Tzidkiyah [and since he caused Nevuchadnezzar to be punished, he is considered \"uncircumcised\"]. First of all, the whole verse is referring to Nevuchadnezzar! And furthermore, what should the righteous Tzidkiyah have done for him? For Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: \"When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man\" [and thus, he was forced to punish him]! Rather, [Rav Yaakov's source is] from here, \"Punishment to the righteous is not good\" [Proverbs 17:26], \"not good\" can only mean \"wicked\", [and this applies to the righteous who punish others], and it is written, \"For You are not a God Who desires wickedness; evil does not abide with You\" [Psalms 5:5].
