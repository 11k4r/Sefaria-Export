Why does bearing the weight of the bundle disqualify the red heifer? The Gemara explains: The <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to the red <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">heifer is different, as we learn </span>by a verbal analogy between the word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“yoke” </span>used with regard to the red heifer and the word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“yoke</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">”</span> used with regard <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">heifer </span>whose neck is broken that any labor disqualifies the former.",

However, since the verse states with regard to the heifer whose neck is to be broken: “That has not been worked with [<span class=\"it-text\">bah</span>]” (Deuteronomy 21:3), this indicates that labor is disqualifying only for “<span class=\"it-text\">bah</span>,” a heifer whose neck is to be broken, but not for a red heifer.",
