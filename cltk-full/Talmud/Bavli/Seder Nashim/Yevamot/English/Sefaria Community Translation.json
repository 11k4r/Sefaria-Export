Yochanan replied: Scripture stated, And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Avner, the captain of the host: ‘Avner, whose son is this youth’? And Avner said: ‘As thy soul liveth, O King, I cannot tell’. But did he not know him? Surely it is written, And he loved him greatly; and he became his armour bearer! He rather made the inquiry concerning his father. But did he not know his father? Surely it is written, And the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken in years among them; and Rab or, it might be said, R. Abba, stated that this referred to the father of David, Jesse. who came in with a large group and went out with a large group. It is this that Saul meant: Whether he descended from Peretz, or from Zerach. If he descended from Perez he would be king, for a king breaks for himself a way and no one can hinder him. If, however, he is descended from Zerach he would only be an important man. ",
