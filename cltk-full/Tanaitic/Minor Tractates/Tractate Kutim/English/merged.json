            "1": "The Samaritan is on the same footing with the Israelite in respect to all damages laid down in the law. The Israelite who slays a Samaritan, or a Samaritan who slays an Israelite, if unintentionally, is to go into exile [i. e., to a city of refuge] ; if intentionally, he is to be slain. If the ox of an Israelite gore the ox of a Samaritan it goes free. But in the case of an ox of a Samaritan, if it is its first offence, it is to pay half the damage. If a subsequent offence, the full damage. Rabbi Meir says: \"The ox of a Samaritan which gores the ox of an Israelite, whether it be the first offence or the second, is to pay the full damage and at the highest appraisement\". ", 
            "0": "We do not buy meat from a Samaritan except that of which he himself eats, nor strings of birds unless he first puts them into his mouth. We do not buy offhand what he would give to Israelites, for they have been suspected of giving Israelites flesh of ritually unclean carcasses. ", 
            "3": "The priests of Israel may share the priestly dues with the Samaritan priests in the territory of the latter, because they are thus, as it were, rescuing the Samaritans from their priests; but not on Israelite territory, lest they should have a presumption on our priesthood. If a Samaritan priest, when he is unclean, eats and gives of his food to an Israelite, it is permitted; if he is clean, the Israelite is forbidden to eat of his food. ", 
            "2": "Their cheeses are allowed. R. Simon b. Eleazar says: \"To wit, the cheeses of householders, but those of dealers are forbidden\". Their pots and presses in which they are accustomed to make wine and vinegar are forbidden. ", 
            "5": "Formerly they said ; The wine of Kador is forbidden because of [the proximity of] Kephar Pansha. This they changed to the effect that wherever the people are suspected of mingling with the Gentiles, wine that is open is forbidden; that which is sealed is allowed. R. Meir said: \"All their wine is allowed except that which is open, if it is in the market\". But the Sages said: \"That which is open in any place is prohibited, that which is sealed is allowed; that which is bored into and then sealed is as though sealed\". Their jars if new are permitted, if old are prohibited. ", 
            "4": "We do not buy bread from a Samaritan baker after Passover until after three bakings, nor from householders until after three Sabbaths, nor from villagers until after three makings. When does this apply? When they have not celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread at the same time with Israel, or have anticipated it by a day; but if they celebrate the feast with Israel, or are a day later, their leaven is permitted. R. Simon forbids it [in general], because they do not know how to observe the feast like Israel. ", 
            "7": "When shall we take them back? When they renounce Mount Gerizim and confess Jerusalem and the resurrection of the dead. From this time forth he that robs a Samaritan shall be as he who robs an Israelite. ", 
            "6": "Why are the Samaritans forbidden to marry into Israel ? Because they are mingled with the priests of the high places. R. Ishmael said: \"They were genuine converts at first. Wherefore were they forbidden? because of their bastards, and because they do not marry the brother's widow\". "

            "11": "These are the things we may not sell them: carcasses not ritually slaughtered, or animals with organic disease; unclean animals and reptiles; the abortion of an animal; oil into which a mouse has fallen; an animal that is mortally ill, or a foetus, although Israelites eat them both, lest the sale lead them into error. And as we do not sell these things to them, so we do not buy them from them, as it is written: \"For thou shalt be a holy people to the Lord thy God. As thou art holy, thou shalt not make another people holier than thyself (Deuteronomy 14:21)\". ", 
            "10": "A Samaritan suffers the <i>halitzah</i> from his sister-in-law, and gives a divorce-writ to his wife. He may be relied upon to bring a divorce-writ from a foreign city to an Israelite. ", 
            "12": "A Samaritan may be relied upon to say whether or not there is a tomb [in a field], or whether an animal has had its firstborn or not. The Samaritan is to be relied upon concerning a tree whether it is four years old or is still unclean, and concerning gravestones, but not with regard to the cleanliness of overhanging boughs or protruding boughs; nor concerning the land of Gentiles, nor concerning the <i>bet peras</i> because they are open to suspicion in all these things. This is the principle: they are not to be believed in any matter in which they are open to suspicion. ", 
            "1": "We do not accept from them the bird-offerings of men or women having issues, nor the bird-offerings of women after child-birth, nor sin-offerings or guilt-offerings. but we accept from them \" vows and freewill-offerings.\" ", 
            "0": "The usages of the Samaritans are in part like those of the Gentiles, in part like those of Israel, but mostly like Israel. ", 
            "3": "We do not sell them large cattle, even if they are maimed, nor ass-foals, nor calves; but we may sell them that which is maimed so it cannot be healed. ", 
            "2": "We do not give them possession of immovable property, we do not sell them sheep for shearing, or crops that are to be harvested, or standing timber; but we may sell them cattle for slaughter. ", 
            "5": "We do not give them wives, nor do we take wives from them.  But we do lend or borrow on usury with them.", 
            "4": "We do not sell them weapons, nor anything that can do damage to people. ", 
            "7": "A Jewess may not deliver a Samaritaness, nor suckle her son; but a Samaritaness may deliver a Jewess and suckle her son in her [the Jewish woman's] quarters. ", 
            "6": "We give them the gleanings and the forgotten sheaf and the corner of the field ; and they have the custom of the forgotten sheaf and the corner, and so may be relied upon concerning the gleanings and the forgotten sheaf and the corner in the proper time, and also concerning the tithe for the poor in its year. But their produce is forbidden as untithed, as in the case of the Gentiles. They invalidate the <i>eruv</i> even as the Gentiles. ", 
            "9": "We may lodge a beast in a Samaritan inn, or hireA Samaritan to go behind our cattle, or entrust our cattle to a Samaritan herdsman. We commit a boy to a Samaritan to teach him a trade. We associate and converse with them anywhere, which is not the case with the Gentiles. ", 
            "8": "An Israelite may circumcise a Samaritan, and a Samaritan an Israelite. Rabbi Judah says: \"A Samaritan is not to circumcise an Israelite because he circumcises him in nothing else than the name of Mount Gerizim.\""
