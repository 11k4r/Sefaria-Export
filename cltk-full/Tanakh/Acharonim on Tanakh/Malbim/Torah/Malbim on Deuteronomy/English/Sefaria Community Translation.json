And [Moshe] did not mention that which they said (Numbers 13:28), \"However, the people who inhabit the country are powerful\" - as this was not an answer, since they were not sent about this... So [the people] should not have paid attention to this, since they gave a positive answer to that which they were sent about. And regarding that which they said, \"the people are powerful,\" they were not sent about it."

And there is a difference between \"casting away\" and \"driving away\" in three things: A) In that one who casts [something] away and throws [it] makes the thing distant from him; B) that by being cast away, the thing spoils; and C) he shows that he does not want to know where it lays. But one who drives [something] away needs to be close to the thing the whole time he is driving it away; and by driving it away, the thing does not spoil; and he knows the place of that thing. So it is possible to explain, \"and you shall take it to heart amidst the various nations\" - when you dwell among the nations, you shall put into your heart, \"that which the Lord your God has driven you out\" - that He has driven you out to a special place. It is like someone who drives something from one place to another until he finds a place where it can rest properly. And this is a proof that the eyes of the Lord your God are upon you for the good."
