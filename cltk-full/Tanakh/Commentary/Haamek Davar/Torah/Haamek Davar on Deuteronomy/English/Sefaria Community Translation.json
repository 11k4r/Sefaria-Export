Which is to say, God had a hand in your travels specifically. Any time the Torah says \"knew\", this is positive, as it says in the Sifri in parshat Behaalotcha, God only remembers for a blessing, as it says \"God remembered us for good.\" And \"knowing\" is similar."

                    "0": "It is known according to the Midrash Shemot Rabbah perek 41 that every time the Torah uses the word Hashkafa, it has negative connotations. In this case, the word is used to show how great the strength of people who take ma'asrot that they can turn negative language into positive. It is surprising why use negative language and reverse it. What would be lost if the pasuk just used the world \"hibitu\" [which has a positive connotation]. The language of \"From your holy dwelling place, from the heavens\" should also be examined since the p'shat is repetAlthough in Chagiga (12) a \"ma'on\" (dwelling place) is called \"shamayim\" (heavens), as it quotes [our pasuk] \"from your holy dwelling place, from the heavens.\" The repetition is because of the word \"min\" (from). The pasuk does not say \"from your holy dwelling place the heavens.\" This teaches two things: The heavens are a place of the planets and stars that emanate blessing onto Earth. Additionally, the gemara in Chagiga (12) explains that me'on is the place where the heavenly angels dwell. And the Maharsha already discussed this in his Chiddushe Aggadot. But the explanation of this verse is that the person who brings bikkurim is glorified in his actions that he did everything to the best of his abilities. He therefore comes to ask for heavenly mercy that God should bless Israel and their land. In truth, a person can not be so certain in his or her deeds that his or her prayers will be heard from on high. For without a doubt this person has made some mistake. Therefore, this prayer was established with the words hashkifa mime'on kodhecha. An explanation: Look down (hashkifa) negatively upon the malachei hasharet. And find in them mistakes. Therefore, look down upon us from the Heavens and bless etc. And, in your mercy, do not focus on any mistakes that were made. In this way everything becomes clear: this is why it is reasonable to say hashkifah etc. But it could have said hashkifah meme'on kodshecha vehabitah min hashamayim, like in Tehillim 102. Instead, it is written as is to teach that \"someone who brings ma'asrot\" etc. "

                    "1": "<b>\"Like all the nations that are around me\":</b> This is not discussing laws (<i>mishpatim</i>), since it is forbidden for us to go away from the laws of the Torah. And about this was the Holy One, blessed be He, upset with the Jews in the days of Shmuel, when they said, \"'and our king will judge us like all of the nations, etc.'\" And [it is] also not [concerning] the matter of war with the nations of the world, since also [about] this did the Holy One, blessed be He, get upset: And he said to Shmuel that (I Samuel 8:7), \"'not with you did they get sick but rather with My being king over them have they gotten sick'\" - the explanation [is that] they did not intend [it] concerning the matter of laws that concern Shmuel, but rather regarding the matter of war; as throughout the days of the Judges they were without a permanent supervisor for the needs of the group regarding the matter of war with the nations of the world, [but it was only addressed] when the word of God came through the Judge; and they wanted that a king should supervise this, and about this did the Holy One, blessed be He, get upset. But rather the explanation of our verse,  <b>\"'like all the nations that are around me'\"</b> is concerning the administration of the state, and as I have written (above): that in regards to this, there are different opinions among people as to which (form of government) functions better. And because of that, the agreement of the state is required; that they say, \"'I will surely, etc.'\"", 
                    "0": "<b>And you shall say, etc.:</b>  The explanation of \"saying\" [here] is not like its simple meaning, but rather like [its] usage in the phrase (Deuteronomy 12:20), “and you shall say,' I want to eat meat'” and in similar [instances]. However according to this usage, it is implied that this is not an absolute commandment to appoint a king, but rather optional, as in the case of “and you shall say, 'I want to eat meat,' etc.” And behold it is known in the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed, that it is a commandment to appoint a king. But, if so, why is it written, \"and you shall say, etc.?\" And it appears that it is because the government of a state depends upon whether it is run according to the opinion of a monarchy or according to the opinion of the people and its representatives: and there are states that cannot support the opinion of the monarchy and there are states that without a king are like a ship without a captain. And [so] such a thing cannot be done according to the coercion of a positive commandment, since a matter that is relevant to the government of the public touches upon mortal danger (<i>sakanat nefashot</i>) which pushes off a positive commandment. For this reason, it is impossible to absolutely command the appointment of king so long as it is without the consent of the people to support the yoke of the king as a result of their seeing states around them functioning more properly [with a king]. And then [only when they do so] is it a positive commandment for the Sanhedrin to appoint a king. And behold, it is certainly impossible to explain that there is no positive commandment here at all, but rather it is like, “and you shall say, 'I want to eat meat,' etc. and you shall slaughter from your cattle, etc.” which is only a negative commandment that comes out of a positive [statement], not to eat without ritual slaughter (<i>shechita</i>); [and that] here too, we would say that this is its explanation - \"Surely place upon yourself a king that He will choose, etc., you may not, etc.,\" [meaning] specifically \"that He will choose.\" But it is impossible to explain like this, as if so, what is it saying, \"and you will possess and you will settle\" and not before? Behold, even before the possession, it is permitted to [establish] a king, as behold, Yehoshua was like a king, as is written by Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 1:3 and 3:8, see there, and Sanhedrin 19. But rather perforce, it is a commandment; yet regardless the Sanhedrin is is not commanded [to act upon it] until the people say that they want the administration of a king. And it is for this reason that for all of three hundred years, while the Tabernacle was in Shilo, there was no king; because it was lacking the people’s agreement. "
