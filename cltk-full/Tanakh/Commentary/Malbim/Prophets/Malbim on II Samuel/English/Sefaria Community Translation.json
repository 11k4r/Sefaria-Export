And on this, it is written AND DAVID, C) that all of Israel joined with him, as it is written, AND DAVID AND ALL OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL BROUGHT UP THE ARK OF HASHEM, WITH TRUMPET-SOUNDS AND THE CALL OF THE SHOFAR, to awaken happiness and joy.

And the Maha\"ri says that Shaul was punished with three punishments: 1) for not having kept the word of Hashem in Gilgal, he was punished such that his kingship would not continue to his sons after him, 2) for having had compassion on Agag, he was punished such that his kingship was torn [from him] during his lifetime and that his days would be cut short such that David would be anointed in his stead, and 3) for having killed the Kohanim of Gd that were in Nov he was punished such that he and his sons would die in battle and not be buried and eulogized as would be befitting. And due to Israel not having protested in his hand, many among Israel were also killed with him, and regarding the killing of the Giv'onim he was not ... and Israel was also punished with a famine because they did not protest, and the fact that the punishment was delayed 22 years is due to it being from [among] the deep judgments of G-d and His thoughts, and just as children are punished for the sin of their fathers because, with respect to the judgments of Heaven, such is conceivable if they hold onto the act of their fathers in their hands; rather his words are abbreviated. And I say, because after the Giv'onim that were found at that time in the city of Nov were killed, because regarding this [the text] said \"that he killed the Giv'onim,\" Shaul spilled like fire his anger also on the rest of the Giv'onim that were found in the [other] cities of Israel, and commanded to destroy them or to expel them from the land, since he suspected them, because their hands were with the rebellious Kohanim, because they were among those who served the Altar and the Kohanim of G-d, and ", 
                "0": "(1-14) The questions: When did Shaul kill the Giv'onim? First it says \"that he killed,\" and afterward it says \"and Shaul sought to strike them,\" implying that Shaul only sought to do and and didn't [actually] do [so]. Why does [the text] not say \"because he killed Nov the city of Kohanim,\" which is a graver sin? Why did the punishment not come during the days of Shaul, who was the one who sinned, and why was it delayed until the generation of David? Should it be that one man would sin and He would be angry regarding the entire congregation - for [in] what did [the nation of] Israel sin? What would the Giv'onim gain from  striking the children of Shaul, who did not sin against them at all? How could such things be done that go against the laws of the Torah in three ways: 1) that they killed the children for the transgression of their fathers, 2) that they killed seven [individuals] in one day, and 3) that they hung their carcasses on the tree/gallows for many days in contradiction to the law of the Torah of Moses? That which is written, \"We have no [claim of] silver... with Shaul, and we have no [claim on a] man to kill [him] within Israel\":  what did they want with this? Behold, it was explained that [the nation of] Israel did not sin with respect to their lives! Why did David then go and take the bones of Shaul and his sons and buried them in the Grave of Kish and had not done this until then? And why does [the text] double its words [as follows]: \"And David went and took...\" (21:12), and then it says a second time, \"And he brought up from there...\" (21:13)? And what is this that is written, \"and they did everything that the king commanded\" (21:14) [after which Gd responded to the plea of the land, i.e., the famine came to an end"
