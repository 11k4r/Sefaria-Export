If being a King is work, and the leprosy caused him to lived alone, then he was free from the work of being a king. Therefore, it was called a House of Freedom. Alternatively, the sages said this 'house of freedom' was a cemetery as it says in the verse (Psalms 88:6) \"...among the dead who are free\"."
