The explanation of Rabbi Yehuda Ben Betira is that he may be with his wife, and there is a doubt as to whether she is a Niddah and he would become impure in the seven days before Yom Kippur. There was another reading that he was taken to Lishkat Barvatan.",
            "1": "..All the chambers in the Beit Hamikdash were exempt from mezuzah aside from Lishkat Parhedrin because it was a residence for the Kohen Gadol seven days a year. Rabbi Yehudah said if it wasn't a living space there, all living spaces are obligated..",
            "9": "It happened that two priests were running to go up the ramp. One pushed his fellow into the four cubit space. He took a knife and stabbed him in the chest. R. Zadok came and stood on the steps leading up the Ulam and said, \"Hear me my Israelite brothers. Behold it says, (Deuteronomy 21) 'When one finds a dead body...and the elders and judges shall go out and measure...' Let us measure who should bring the calf, the sanctuary or the courtyards.\" Everyone groaned and cried. Afterwards the father of the young [priest] came and said, \"My brothers, I am your atonement. My son's pulse is still beating and the knife has not yet been defiled.\" This shows that the impurity of the knife was more difficulty for Israel than bloodshed. And so it says, \"Moreover, Manasseh put so many innocent persons to death that he filled Jerusalem [with blood] from end to end.\" From here they said, \"Through the sin of bloodshed the Shekhinah departs and the Temple is defiled.\"  "

And even though one did viduy before eating and drinking, one [also] needs to do viduy after eating and drinking lest they did something disgraceful during the meal. And even though one did viduy after eating and drinking, one [also] needs to do viduy during the night service. And even though one did viduy during the night service, one [also] needs to do viduy during the morning  service.
