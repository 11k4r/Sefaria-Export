            "There was a man in the city of Babylon, and his name was Jehoiakim.",
            "He took for himself a woman, Susanna the daughter of Hilkiah; and she was beautiful and feared God",
            "because her parents were righteous and directed her in the paths of the Torah of Moses.",
            "Jehoiakim was very rich and he had a desirable garden by his house; and everyone gathered unto him because he was the most respected of the men of the city. ",
            "In that year, two elders of the city became judges of the nation.",
            "They were among the men about whom the LORD said, \"from Babylon there went out wickedness, and from her elders, the judges of the nation.\"",
            "They came everyday to Jehoiakim's house, and if a person had a concern, he would come to them.",
            "In the afternoon[s], when every person had gone his way, Susanna would go to swim in her husband's garden.",
            "The elders saw the woman walking every day in the garden and they lusted.",
            "Their hearts were turned and instead of turning their eyes to heaven, they turned their eyes toward her; and they did not remember the Torah of the LORD or his judgments.",
            "Even though both were overcome with passion, the men did not reveal their love to each other because they were embarrassed.",
            "Every day they rushed to the door of the garden to see her.",
            "The men said to each other, \"let us return to our houses because it is near time for lunch.\"",
            "After they went and after the men separated from one another, each one turned back and returned to the garden and found themselves together.",
            "And when one questioned the other, saying: \"What is the meaning of this?\". They confessed their evil desire and they took counsel together and set a time to ambush her when she was by herself.",
            "On that day, they were lying in wait and Susanna came as she was accustomed, to wash in the garden during the heat of the day. With her were her two handmaidens. ",
            "And there was no man in the vineyard other than the two old men who hid to ambush her...",
            "And Shoshana said to her daughters, Buy me oil, and a pitcher, and shut the vineyard, until I am washed...",
            "And the girls would do as she requested and close the door in her flock",
            "And they did not see the men because they were hiding",
            "The two old men came out of the hiding place and ran over Shoshana and said:...",
            "Behold, the vineyard is locked, and there is no one here to see, and our soul desires you. So let us come and come to you:",
            "And if you will not listen to us, we will testify that we have seen a man with you in the vineyard, and therefore you sent the girls from you:",
            "And Shoshana sighed and said to him, \"Because I am narrow and clenched,...",
            "If I do what they want, I am the daughter of my own death, and if I cease, who will save me from their hand?...",
            "It is a good thing for me to fall into cleanliness as in the hands of a man who sins to God:",
            "And Shoshana raised her voice and cried out, and the old men shouted at her:...",
            "And one ran to the door and opened it;...",
            "And the people of the house heard her cry and ran to the vineyard to see what was doing:"
