            "There was a man in the city of Babylon, and his name was Jehoiakim.", 
            "He took for himself a woman, Susanna the daughter of Hilkiah; and she was beautiful and feared God", 
            "because her parents were righteous and directed her in the paths of the Torah of Moses.", 
            "Jehoiakim was very rich and he had a desirable garden by his house; and everyone gathered unto him because he was the most respected of the men of the city. ", 
            "In that year, two elders of the city became judges of the nation.", 
            "They were among the men about whom the LORD said, \"from Babylon there went out wickedness, and from her elders, the judges of the nation.\"", 
            "They came everyday to Jehoiakim's house, and if a person had a concern, he would come to them.", 
            "In the afternoon[s], when every person had gone his way, Susanna would go to swim in her husband's garden.", 
            "The elders saw the woman walking every day in the garden and they lusted.", 
            "Their hearts were turned and instead of turning their eyes to heaven, they turned their eyes toward her; and they did not remember the Torah of the LORD or his judgments.", 
            "Even though both were overcome with passion, the men did not reveal their love to each other because they were embarrassed.", 
            "Every day they rushed to the door of the garden to see her.", 
            "The men said to each other, \"let us return to our houses because it is near time for lunch.\"", 
            "After they went and after the men separated from one another, each one turned back and returned to the garden and found themselves together.", 
            "And when one questioned the other, saying: \"What is the meaning of this?\". They confessed their evil desire and they took counsel together and set a time to ambush her when she was by herself.", 
            "On that day, they were lying in wait and Susanna came as she was accustomed, to wash in the garden during the heat of the day. With her were her two handmaidens. "
