Therefore when a certain thing breaks or is lost he should not worry at all, for he has elevated what was relevant to him and therefore it broke; and when it is lost and comes to another [person’s possession], presumably that thing also contains holy sparks that are also relevant to that person. Therefore when he has elevated from this what he needed, the thing came to another [person’s possession] for him to elevate what is relevant to him.” And see also in Vayikra, p.40b."

Let there rather be two people in one room, each secluding themselves with their Creator. Sometimes, when one is truly cleaving to Gd, they can seclude themselves even in a house full of people. See further on in section 47-48 which say that there should be no one present when wants to cleave to God."
