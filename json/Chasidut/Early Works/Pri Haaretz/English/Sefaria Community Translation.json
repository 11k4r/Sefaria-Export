            "\"And these are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham\". Rashi of blessed memory explains \"Jacob and Esav, those mentioned in the Section.\"", 
            "The matter is according the response Hillel have to the convert who came to be converted on the condition that [Hillel] teach him the entire Torah on one leg. He received him and taught him \"that which is hateful to you do not do to another...\". Rashi of blessed memory explains, this is the Commandment \"Love your neighbor as yourself\". See the Maharsha who objects [and wonders] why [Hillel] did not phrase this to him as the positive commandment which it is in the Torah, even in a translated manner of some kind such as something in positive form like 'have mercy on another'. But he said it in a negated form, as if a negative commandment - 'what is hateful to you do not do to another'.", 
            "However, the matter is as they stated, may their memory be for blessing: \"With Ten Utterances was the world created and they are juxtaposed to the Ten Commandments, as out Sages of blessed memory stated, that He looked into the Torah and created the world. For the matter of the creation of the world is known to have begun from a state wherein He and His Name were in one simple unity without any perceptibility, comprehension or bounds whatsoever, for it is infinite. And when it arose in His simple will create, He constricted Himself, as is known. Now the matter of simple unity and infinity is the utterance \"I am\" and all the [corresponding] positive Commandments, the constriction (TzimTzum), which is limitation (Gevurah), and the [corresponding] utterance \"You shall not have\" along with all the details are the negative Commandments which [when taken together] is the entirety of the Torah through cause and effect to each and every detail. And all of the roots and branches in general and her details, which have source above, manifest [into] fruits below in the form of the performance of the Commandments, which is our holy Torah with all of its Commandments, Decrees and Laws. ", 
            "And behold they of blessed memory stated \"'Inasmuch as Abraham obeyed me and kept my charge...\" to teach us that our father Abraham, peace be upon him, kept even [the mitzvah] of Joining the Cooked Foods\" which on the surface is confusing for how could he have known to do so? And if we say that he perceived [himself] the actions of the Commandments and the Laws to which the [human] intellect can bind, nevertheless its difficult [to understand] how he could have perceived the Decrees which have no reasoning [behind them] to which the [human] intellect cannot bind, like the Red Hefer and other such Decrees. Our discussion will be understood according the the words of our blessed Sages who stated, \"to you I will reveal the reason behind the Red Hefer and the others will be Decrees (without reason)\" for all the Decrees do [in fact] have a reason and a source above in the order of the creation, for the creation occurred in accordance with the Torah, its just only that 'no mind can contain it' - and [this is the meaning of] \"...the others will be Decrees\". However, the Torah does not speak to the great ones such as Moshe or our father Abraham, peace be upon them, before whom nothing stood as a Decree [without reason]; rather all the Decrees to them were Commandments in their understanding and they perceived their reasoning and source. ", 
            "However, without [first] nullifying the Commandments to [the point that] they would no longer need apply to him, it is impossible for [the great man] to convert the Decrees into Commandments. For example, all the negative Commandments like do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal - warnings which are not applicable to him in relation to breaking of his lustful pursuit of all the physical attributes which he'd never use for his personal needs whatsoever, [rather] only for God. All actions for his personal needs are abhorrent to him as mud and feces from which we need not warn any man to distance himself for he will in any case do so out of disgust. In this vein, King David, peace be upon him, said \"and my heart is void within me\". For a person of this ilk, for whom the Commandments need not apply, to him is revealed the reasoning of the Decrees and the Decrees thus become as Commandments. And this is what they of blessed memory meant that in the days of the Messiah the Commandments will be nullified \"for the Land will be filled with Understanding of God\", and they will possess a 'different Torah' - from the Decrees which will become as Commandments. And when a person goes from strength to strength, higher and higher, until he reaches and stands before the root of the whole Torah and Commandments which is \"I am HaShem your God...\", simple unity and infinite, he then crimps the wings of all the Commandments and Decrees, and they are all nullified. And this is the nullification of the Evil Inclination and elevation of it [back] to prior to the beginning of creation. For from where [else] does the Evil Inclination come? In truth, in the beginning and prior to the creation is the positive [Commandment(s)] \"I am HaShem your God...\" and [only] afterward the negative [Commandments]. But in [human] perception of the Commandments [the order] must be reversed - in the beginning to 'abandon evil' (negative commandments) and then 'do good' (positive commandments). For a man in his beginning is [in the aspect of] \"a wild ass is born a man\" - his [spiritual] level is very low and he needs to add from the mundane onto his holiness, higher and higher, until [he reaches] \"I am HaShem your God...\" And this is [the meaning] of the convert who came to be converted and wanted to learn the whole Torah [standing] on one leg. Meaning, [the whole Torah] in one self-sustaining construct. And in truth his lesson [should have been] that indeed the source of all is \"I am HaShem your God\" (as above). But the convert could not have understood the apprehension of [the positive] \"I am...\" if not by way of the negation prior (\"And you shall not have\"), in order that it be on his level, which begins very low. And this is why he said \"The rest is commentary. Go study\"; for the [actual] Commandment is [the positive form] \"Love thy neighbor...\" and the negated [form] \"that which is hateful to you, do not do to another\" - they are the Commandments \"I am...\" and \"You shall not...\", [respectively]. And in accordance with Rashi's understanding, this is \"And these are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham\" for it is the order of creation and the meaning is that Isaac, who is the constriction (TzimTzum) and the boundaries (Gevurot), is the son of Abraham who is loving-kindess (Chesed) and simple unity. And from these, they propagated to the entire world. And this is what Rashi of blessed memory explained in that 'the generations are Jacob and Esav who are spoken about in the Section'. For as Rashi explained about Esav \"he was made and fully developed with hair\" on the day he was born. And as the Zohar states on the verse \"When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born\", immediately upon the day it is born it is called an Ox, in contrast to a Man. Although in reality [only] a man's materialistic attributes are [in fact] fully developed on the day he's born, as is said 'Sin couches at the door...of the elderly king and the fool'. And so on the day of his birth he was called Esav. Afterward Jacob's hand held onto Esav's heel, the meaning of which is that 'his hand' is [Jacob's] perception which is Lower Wisdom [represented by the letter] YuD - and this is YaDo/Hand. And afterward, from [the Lower Wisdom] he reaches Upper Wisdom and the Commandment \"I am...\" which is the simple unity. He who is of understanding will understand. "

            "The passuk reads \" The riffraff in their midst felt a gluttonous craving...they cried for their families\"", 
            "Rashi comments z'l \"on account of the family affairs...\" And the notion that [Moshe] spoke strongly \"Why have You dealt ill with Your servant... If You would deal thus with me, kill me rather, I beg You, and let me see no more of my wretchedness!‚Äù", 
            "This idea is in accordance with the saying of the Sages z'l in Ethics of our Fathers, \"Each day a heavenly voice emerges from mount Horeb and declares...\" For it is known that there are six hundred thousand souls in Israel, accordingly the same [number of] letters in the Torah; as is known the the Torah, The Holy One, and Israel are all one, and Israel is the body of/for the Torah, and it is known that through the Torah The Holy One created the world which is letters. And there can be nothing in the world without the letters which bring life to it for they are the speech of The Holy One and if the letters disappeared and weren't perceptible, the speaker prior to his speaking what can be said of his speech(?) - that the letters are in potential and not perceptible - it is a general principle is that the life force of each thing are the letters within it. And if a man sins God Forbid, the letters which are the life-force enter Evil and give power to Evil, and also it doesn't appear in the eyes of the flesh that the truth is known. And thus he gives a confession of [these] things in saying 'I sinned' with bitterness of heart on account of his Awe of God combined with Love of God. And through this the letters which were providing life-force to Evil leave and the Evil is left without the life-force and is consequently nullified. ", 
            "And so a person [must] remember [this] and take care during his learning the Torah how he speaks the letters of the Torah, for with them was the world created, and by himself attach the letters to their root letters in the Torah, which was given like this to the world through 'thunder and lightening' in order that 'the fear of God should be upon you and you will be without sin', as explained. In any case, if 'awe' and 'fear' befall a person in 'thunder and lightening', its seems apparent that he would not sing, God forbid. For how could there be the possibility of sin with all that. And this is the idea of the 'heavenly voice which goes forth', they are the letter of the Torah inside every person who recalls and declares them daily. And he who doesn't not hear the heavenly voice [and for whom] it is as if he did not declare, 'woe unto him...for insulting the Torah' which is inside of him. And this is the meaning of 'for anyone who does not involve himself in the Torah' meaning - who is not inscribed in the Torah, \"he is called \"rebuked\"'; for this is the idea of rebuke for a person which changes his 'face to redness'", 
            "Our Rabbis of holy memory said that all the souls of Israel until Moshiach stood at Sinai and received the Torah, which are the letters of their roots whose 'remembrancers take no rest'. IT is known that Moshe is the Knowledge of all of Israel who are the six hundred thousand souls. And the Manna was on account of Moshe's merit in order to enliven Israel with bread from Heaven which since it was spiritually flavored, any desired taste, which is the life-force itself without any rain because Moshe was separated from his wife which is the aspect of physicality, so thus Israel was provided sustenance - and this is 'the Torah wasn't given except to those who ate Manna' for it is the life-force which are the letters which is not the case in regards to physical eating which is a \"whisperer [which] separateth familiar friends\". This is why we must be careful in regards to eating the heart of an animal on account of the soul which depends on it. And so upon Israel eating the Manna, the shed their [physical] filth and did not desire a single [animalistic] urge or love of physicality only for God himself. ", 
            "But the 'Rabble-rousers' who were not of Israel, but who also were refined upon eating the Manna and ought not have desired any physicality, nonetheless they had such urges. Meaning, that they desired to love of physicality [again], because they were not of Israel, and it was impossible for them to exist entirely with their life-force being Knowledge, and thus they asked to eat meat.

            "\"And HaShem blessed Avraham with everything.\" In the Midrash \"Because of the Tithes, and it says 'and he gave him tithes from everything'.\"", 
            "And the matter is in accordance with the words of the Zohar on \"And Avraham was old, advanced of days\" (see there). In order to explain the matter lucidly, as the Rabbis told in regards to Barzelai the Geladite who was eighty years old and said \"Can I tell the difference between good and bad? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks?\" And the Rabbis said \"He removes the speech of men of trust and takes away the understanding of the aged\"", 
            "Behold, in truth in regards to all the inclinations of the world it may be said that 'the way of the adulterer is to try and \"satisfy his hunger\".'", 
            "And so the Sages said \"Man does not die with half his inclination still in his hand\" and therefore they 'age' the understanding of Man so that his understanding is never calm and constantly lusting. And as the text says the \"craving of a lazy man kills him\", and the statement \"hope deferred sickens the heart...\"", 
            "And in accordingly with we may find in the service of God that \"the word of the Lord is rare\" and its impossible to settle for anything else. For all who are greater than his friend perceive a great depth which is concealed from his friend, and his friends perceptions are as nothing in his view, and as it says \"wisdom, from nothing is found\", for the Blessed one is without end and so all his perceptions are without end. But the core of service is connecting to Him in each and every attribute and in every way which Man is overcome, for the Inclination of Man overcomes him daily. And if yesterday Man knocked him (the Inclination) down and overcame him, and then the spirit of God rested on him in order to connect to him through that attribute, nevertheless the inclination will attack him tomorrow in a different and more harsh manner. And even if he is successful everyday 'in the shade of God' and 'the cover of the Supernal', nevertheless the Inclination will forever strengthen itself against him in order to make him fall into his trap, unless the Man strengthens himself greatly to the point that he liberates and  frees that attribute from the the any selfish use whatsoever - and he shall not derive any pleasure from its use except if used in the service of his blessed Creator. As King David of blessed memory said \"and my heart is void within me\" and thus the Inclination withdraws from him, for what would be captured if the Man receives no pleasure at all from using the attribute for his own selfish purpose, and on the contrary, the Man would feel sorrow! As our Rabbis said \"The good of the Evil Doers is evil to the Righteous\"", 
            "In this manner we refer to this as \"Redemption\" and \"The Building of the Holy Temple in his Days\", for \"days\" are the \"attributes\" as is known, and presently we redeem this attribute from the harsh servitude of the Inclination. And so long as there is no redemption, his Inclination will continue to attack him, and it will make no difference whether one, two or a hundred such instances. And if, God forbid, his sins trap him even one in ten or in one hundred of the instances, in any case the \"previous period shall be void\". Meaning that all which he overcame against the Inclination with the 'Hidden Mind' and 'Holy Spirit' up until that instance, all of it enters the Kelipah upon that instance, and he does not remain fortified by the original thought and effort with which prior he [successfully] stood against the Inclination with that very perseverance and divine guidance. For now, after knowing its greatness and ingenuity, and bringing upon himself the governance of the Inclination and heeding it, those (divine guidance and effort) holy sparks now also enters the Kelipah; for how could a rejuvenating remedy be extracted out of that very same guidance itself. As the Sage of blessed memory say \"every generation for whom the Temple is not built in their days, its as if it is destroyed in their days\", and the meaning of the unbuilt Temple is as explained above, for since it was not built (fully) and the Inclination toppled it, it is in any case destroyed - that the sparks of holiness have entered the Kelipah; meaning to say - in the Inclination's overcoming of the holy lifeforce which rested on him yesterday and the day before that in order to save them (the sparks) from it. ", 
            "And inasmuch as [the Inclination] overcame him at that time, he in any case needs to search for and strengthen himself through a different method, guidance and effort, for the battle. For the Inclination will not be suppressed by the divine guidance of yesterday or the day before it. The general rule is that Belief in what the eye cannot see, the ear cannot hear, and no mind can apprehend - 'the Lord alone shall be exalted'. And subsequently, the strengthening of Awe which in any case follows from the Belief, for the two are really one thing in simple unity. It is this which brings connection to Him, may he be blessed, through each and every attribute, since these things stand at the height of the world and break every lust and Kelipah. And when these (Belief and Awe) overtake him \"all the evildoers are scattered\"...\"as wax melts before fire\" and \"to have self-control to conquer\".", 
            "And this is \"Avraham was old advanced in days\". Meaning, through his attributes he came to 'age'; and the meaning of 'age' is the abrogation of childhood and futility which is the way of the material world. From the abundant use of his senses all his days, in his age he nullified them. And all use them more, the more age overtakes them. For this is the way of the divine. Once he takes over his attributes to use them in order to serve Him, may he be blessed, and for no selfish benefit whatsoever, he releases from the attributed and nullifies in constant connection with Him, may he be blessed, without and interruption at all.", 
            "...And this is \"And the Lord blessed Avraham in everything\", because the connection is called \"everything\", for it combined two into one, as it says \"Everything that is in Heaven and on Earth\", as is known; and the Midrash says \"for the Tithes as it says 'he gave tithes from everything'. For it is known that Awe is called Tithe, which is the final 'Hey' and his the Tithe from Everything - meaning, Tithe from the connection as is known, and from the Awe and Belief he merit the connection, as per above.

        "Sh'lach": [
            "In the passuk of Sh'lach Lecha: Rashi z'l explains that The Holy One did not consent rather only did not protest against then, and said 'if you want, send'.", 
            "And the concept is related to the Sages z'l who said \"Three goodly gifts did the Holy One give to Israel, and all were on account of suffering, Torah, the Land of Israel, and the World to Come\", and they explained them all from what it written.", 
            "The concept it - it is known that our Sages z'l said \"Through the Torah the Holy One cared the world\", and these are the letters of the Torah as is known, and it is expounded in the Sefer Yetzirah and affixed in the mouth that the letters were affixed regularly in the mouth, and the illumination of the letters awaken all the worlds from the [supernal] attributes and downward, for they are the origin of the worlds and their revelation, in this aspect of 'I will build the world from loving-kindness', and there's nothing desirable which will be beyond the attributes rather [he merely need] call-out [to him]. This is recalled by the Zohar by 'a loud depth' which is upward - for it is the depth of the heart, which cannot be garbed in the letters.", 
            " It is known that the truth and nature of the creations is to gravitate toward their root, 'the passage's purpose is to drag' - It is the way of the Inanimate to sprout and elevate from its place, and the way of the Animate things to grow in order to enter the life of the Speaking things. Though they know nothing [of it] they are imprinted [to be this way] naturally. And if so, it is appropriate to [therefore] refer [this to] the letters of the Torah which through them was the world created in order to gravitate toward its source. For the attributes precede the creation of the world by two thousand years, are the entire physical creation extended from [them] from its origin, for there is nothing without the attributes. And they are the [thing which] stands up the body from the lower and its life-force to the ever higher. So separating the life-force from the body until its nullification from emotion [to the point wherein] there would be no difficult suffering from it, as it known by those who investigate that all the sufferings of the body come from the the powers of the heart, and every suffering is a separation from cleaving [to the divine]. And this is the concept of all weakness, may God have mercy, as is known from the concept of the separation of the soul from the body which is from the seven judgments, as is known.", 
            "Indeed in this case there is no separation, for their remains an imprint from the perspective of the concealed spirituality. Nevertheless, it is understandable that sufferings increase until the body remains standing without any life-force, as is known from the Prophets and Writings of Daniel and his successors, who were truly sick from their nullification of their feelings.", 
            "Our Sages z'l bring forth the saying 'blessed is the man who God torments and learns from his Torah', and we can explain this in a few ways. 1 - It is known that [the divine name] YH is half of the name [HVYH], and all the defects of man are a result of separating the letters of God('s) [name] as is known.  There are people of unrefined bodies who do not suffer except by bring hit or trampled, for the fool will understand from the rebuke of these blows a hundred [times as much], for he is tortured by [these] things, which would not work without these torments for he is unrefined. This is not the case in regards to the freedom of one who has the Torah, inscribed on the tablets. And our Sages z'l explained freedom, as is known, as the 'world of freedom', that he understands and is wise, which is known that they are [the] two thousand years and are higher than the attributes, he suffers from things which are the letters gravitating toward their source which is the Torah.", 
            "And this is as the Sages z'l explained with the words \" 'And teach him from your Torah' we learn from an a fortiori inference from the law of 'an eye and a tooth' through which the salve attains his freedom; suffering that cleanses a person's entire body all the more so...' And the abrasions refine the physicality and nullify the evil completely. For he had involved good and evil in all his attributes and could not return in the state he was, like 'tooth and eye' which cannot [ever] be returned. And in this this we can resolve the difficulty that the world is beset with suffering - and the body to its strength. And a person that \"understands\" is tormented by these things - attaining understanding of the separation of the letters which occurred by his hand God forbid. And this is \"Happy is the man God {YH} torments\"; meaning, the Wisdom and Understands which are Y and H. And this is \"teach him from your Torah\" which are the bodies of the Torah, accordingly he gifted the Land of Israel through suffering.", 
            "But this requires a bit of explanation. As is known in relation to the concept of the Manna that it was a bread from heaven, and was one a level above the Earth and as spiritual as is known. This is seemingly difficult for how is it possible to misuse something divine from God for [evil] urges, and for it to be spiritual food as it was divorced from evil?", 
            "But the concept is as is known from the statement of the Zohar \"Even an angel that desires to be seen in this world needs to dress in garments of this world\". And this is the way of all spiritual simplicity - that is conforms in its descent to the manner and way of the vessel in which is dresses, as is known from the analogy of water which conforms to the shape of the vessel whether circular or square. And thus even the simple spiritual in its descent into Man and its entry, changes in accordance with the man, if he is good or bad will come to fruition. For all will come to fruition according to what the Man is. In the scornful person the spiritual causes all the more evil, because much of the spiritual life-force is thin in the shell {k'lipa} and a scornful person resultantly becomes more and more [evil]. God's intention in giving the Land of Israel to Israel was to sustain them with the sustenance of the Land of Israel which is in the quality of the Manna, and \"absorbs water from the rains of heaven\", which is the Holy one himself and not via a ministering [angel], and as is explained in the sefer Chesed L'Avraham, which is therefore why the eating of Manna ceased upon going to the Land [of Israel], because they did not require it. This is per the first idea [above].", 
            "This is as we've already learned that everything is according the the way of the person, and God forbid is can further actualized as referenced [above], because everything depends on preparation and the how one invites [the process]. The rule is accordance with why he eats - if [he eats] in order to resist then he is more spiritual and thin, and [if he eats] in order to actualize physicality then he becomes that way. Ad its explained \"the two that ate the Paschal offering\" where our Sages z'l said of them \"and the just walk in them and sinners stumble over them\".", 
            "If it is a man's intention to polish [spiritually], his purpose and gaze is entirely on spiritual life-force, but this is not the case in regards to a person who's desires rule his purpose and gaze in accordance with 'the physical desire among you'. Therefore, God said 'I swear that I will give them now an opportunity to fall into error' - I gave them free will and anyone who desires to err it is open to him. In this way it is possible to explain the passuk \"Indeed, of Zion it will be said    'This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her.‚Äù The one born in her and the one who awaits to see her, the Sages z'l said \"the place in which the penitent stand, the completely righteous cannot stand' as explained by the Rambam z'l that the remorse of the penitent must be the same in this manner - that he regrets his existence in the world in general as chooses with truthful heart. For it is better not to be in the world and do evil, and this is utter self-sacrifice and higher than the attributes.",

As is known to us through the concept and knowledge revealed to us. For the concealed things are to God our Lord, but it is explained in the book of the Torah \"And he said let there be light\", \"and there was a firmament\", and so all the creation of the heavens and earth and pooled waters and animals and birds, and after them all \"and He created man\" who encompasses the upper and lower worlds, as Rashi z'l explains.",

And via the spirit of Man which ascends ever high in order to cling to Him who is blessed or the spirit of Man and Animal which descends very low God forbid, and all the worlds and creations follow him inasmuch as they are all included with him, as is known that the animal soul in Man is the soul of desire, and all the creations accordingly. And if Man pursues his animal soul (desires), he becomes an animal in the form/appearance of man, and in the thing which he spoiled he must rectify, as its explained in relation to the sacrifice of the Sotah - where she acted as an animal, her offering feeds an animal. And this is the conception of all sacrifices/offerings \"from an animal...from cattle...from sheep\". Apart from the hidden things which are the God our Lord, the idea is to rectify his animal action and return to God as the priests will instruct him when he brings his sacrifice.
