            "1 The statement is asked \"He who calculates his ways in this world will be worthy to behold the salvation of the Holy One, blessed be He; as it is said: To him that ordereth his way will I show the salvation of God\"", 
            "2 This is expounded in the words of Rashi z'l \"What has the matter of the Sabbatical year to do with Mount Sinai that Scripture fell compelled to expressly state where it was commanded? Were not all commandments given on Sinai? Etc...\"", 
            "3 And our Sages of blessed memory said \"With ten utterances was the world created, but behold with one utterance wasn't it able to be created?...But to bring goodly reward...Ten generations from Adam...Ten generations from Noah to Abraham...He received the reward of them all.\"", 
            "4 It is a puzzle that the \"world is upon ten utterances and could have been on one..\" and does God 'deal imperiously with his creations'? Insofar as he was able to create with a single utterance why did he create with ten utterances - in order to interpose punishment in the ten utterances? But in truth the concept of the ten utterances are ten instances of \"And he said\" as are written in the order of creation, in which each \"And he said\" was a different specific creation. As is known to us through the concept and knowledge revealed to us. For the concealed things are to God our Lord, but it is explained in the book of the Torah \"And he said let there be light\", \"and there was a firmament\", and so all the creation of the heavens and earth and pooled waters and animals and birds, and after them all \"and He created man\" who encompasses the upper and lower worlds, as Rashi z'l explains.", 
            "And our Sages of blessed memory said \"the end of an action begins in thought\", that all were only created for the sake of Man. And our Sages of blessed memory said \"The whole world was not created except for this [Man]\". And so the entire world behaves in accordance with Man as its says \"And have dominion over the fish of the sea...\", And has King David peace be upon him said \"You made him have dominion over the works of his hand all which you put under his feet\". And as the concept is in the lower worlds, so to it is in the upper worlds which were created with Man over them all. As our Sages of blessed memory said \"There is not a blade of grass below which does not have an Angel above...which tells it to grow\", And once Man existed to rule over everything below, also he rules over the angels and their superiors and the upper worlds which were created for him, for he is King over all. 'With this the world(s) ascend and with this they descend'. And via the spirit of Man which ascends ever high in order to cling to Him who is blessed or the spirit of Man and Animal which descends very low God forbid, and all the worlds and creations follow him inasmuch as they are all included with him, as is known that the animal soul in Man is the soul of desire, and all the creations accordingly. And if Man pursues his animal soul (desires), he becomes an animal in the form/appearance of man, and in the thing which he spoiled he must rectify, as its explained in relation to the sacrifice of the Sotah - where she acted as an animal, her offering feeds an animal. And this is the conception of all sacrifices/offerings \"from an animal...from cattle...from sheep\". Apart from the hidden things which are the God our Lord, the idea is to rectify his animal action and return to God as the priests will instruct him when he brings his sacrifice. And through this all the lowest creatures are elevated up high and those which "
