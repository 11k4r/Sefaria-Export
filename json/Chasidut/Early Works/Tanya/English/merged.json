                "It was taught at the end of Yoma: There are three categories of atonement and repentance is with each one: If one violates a positive mitzva and repents, he is forgiven before he moves from his place. If one violates a prohibition and repents, repentance suspends [his punishment] and Yom Kippur atones. (To clarify: regarding their fulfillment, positive mitzvos are greater in that they supersede prohibitions, this is because divine light and sustenance is drawn into the supernal worlds from the Blessed One's Infinite Light through the fulfillment of positive mitzvos (as in Zohar, \"The 248 commandments are the 248 limbs of the King.\") as well as on the divine soul of [the performer] as in \"Who sanctifies us with His commandments\". but when is comes to repentance, even though one can be absolved of punishment over his rebellion against the Blessed One's Kingship, by not acting in acordance with the King's word, still the divine light is missing, and so on. As in the verse, \"Mistakes cannot be corrected.\" i.e. \"He who neglected reciting the evening and morning Shema\" and so on. even if he would begin to always be scrupulous to recite the evening and morning Shema, his repentance is cannot correct the one time that he neglected. ", 
                "If one commits a transgression that warrants excision or death from the earthly court, repentance and Yom Kippur suspend [his punishment], and suffering absolves (i.e. completes the atonement. and completes the atonement, as it is stated: “Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes” (Psalms 89:33)."

However, the beginning and foundation of the mitzvah of repentance is to return to truly G-d with a complete heart and it is necessary to explain this well and at great length, beginning with a quote from the holy Zohar in explaining the word \"Teshuva-repentance\" in the manner of mysticism: \"Teshuv-hey. The lower hey - the lower teshuvah, the higher hey - the higher teshuvah.\" "

Was there ever such a thing, and where did you find this custom in all of the books of the Sages of Israel early and late to have the custom and decree to ask material advice about what to do in the issues of the material world, even from the great sages of Israel, the early ones like the Tanaim and Emoraim to whom no secrets were held back and the path of heaven was lit up for them, but only the prophets themselves, who were before Israel, like Samuel the visionary who Saul went  to to ask God about the asses that his father had lost!", 
                "For in truth, all of the issues of the human except for the words of Torah and the fear of heaven are only attainable through prophesy, and the sages do not have bread as our Rabbis said, \"Everything is in the hands of heaven except the fear of heaven,\" and \"Seven things are hidden... A person does not know how they will make a living... and when the kingdom of David will be restored...\" Behold they held these things equal to each other. And what it says in Isaiah \"A counselor and skilled artisan,\" and  also what our Rabbis said, \"and they benefit from them with counsel and insight,\" this is referring to words of Torah which are called \"insight.\" As our Rabbis said, \"a counselor, this is one who knows how to extend the years and fix the months...\" For the secret of the extension is called counsel and secret in the language of the Torah as it says in Sanhedrin 87, see what Rashi says there.",

For love distorts the line, and it is a covering for the eyes so that they will not see truth because of the great love they have of the life of the body for the sake of heaven to serve God with it in the flash of the fire and the great flame from the love of their souls for God. And therefore, they are rightly angered by the pain of the body (God forbid) and they are not able to accept it at all until they can pass them from their minds by pounding their legs from city to city to ask advice from afar and they do not pay attention to God, to return to Him with a lowly spirit and a subdued body to accept His rebuke with love for the one that God loves..."

        "Introduction": [
            "Being an Epistle sent to the Communities of our Faithful. May the Almighty guard them. To you, O men, do I call. Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, who seek the Lord; and may G‑d hearken to you, both great and small, all the faithful in our land and those adjacent to it. May each in his place achieve peace and eternal life, for ever and ever. Amen. May this be His will.", 
            "Behold, it is known as a saying current among people— all our faithful— that listening to words of moral advice is not the same as seeing and reading them in books. For the reader reads after his own manner and mind, and according to his mental grasp and comprehension at that particular time. Hence, if his intelligence and mind are confused and wander about in darkness in G‑d's service, he finds difficulty in seeing the beneficial light that is concealed in books, even though the light is pleasant to the eyes and [brings] a healing to the soul.Apart from this, the books on piety which stem from human intelligence, certainly have not the same appeal for all people, for not all intellects and minds are alike, and the intellect of one man is not affected and excited by what affects [and excites] the intellect of another. Compare with what our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said with reference to the blessing of the \"Wise One in Secrets\" (חכם הרזים ) upon beholding 600,000 Jews, because their minds are dissimilar from one another, and so on. As also Rabbi Moses ben Nachman, of blessed memory, [explains the reason for this blessing] in Mikhamot, elaborating on the commentary of the Sifre concerning Joshua who is described as \"a man in whom there is spirit,\" \"who can meet the spirit of each and every one,\" and so on.But even the books on piety, whose basis is in the peaks of holiness, the Midrashim of our Sages, of blessed memory, through whom the spirit of G‑d speaks and His word is on their tongue; and [although] the Torah and the Holy One, blessed be He, are one and the same, and all the 600,000 general [souls] of Israel with their individual [offshoots] down to the \"spark\" in the most worthless and least estimable members of our people, the children of Israel, are thus bound up with the Torah, and the Torah binds them to the Holy One, blessed be He, as is known from the holy Zohar— this [bond] pertains [only] in a general way to the community of Israel as a whole. [As for the individual] although the Torah was given to be interpreted, in general and in particular down to the minutest detail, to [apply to] each individual soul of Israel, which is rooted in it [so that these books pertain to every person], nevertheless not every person is privileged to recognise his individual place in the Torah.", 
            "[A further difficulty is the complexity of Torah interpretation.] Even in the case of the laws governing things prohibited and permitted, which have been revealed to us and to our children, we find and witness differences of opinion among Tana'im and Amora'im from one extreme to the other. Yet \"these as well as these are the words of the living G‑d.\" The plural is used as a reference to the source of life for the souls of Israel, which are generally divided into three categories — right, left, and centre, namely, kindness (chesed), might (gevurah), and so on, so that the souls, whose root originates in the category of kindness, are likewise inclined towards kindness in the leniency of their decisions, and so forth, as is known. All the more, a minori ad mains, in the case of those things which are hidden [yet revealed only] to the Lord onr G‑d, these being the awe and love that are in the mind and heart of each and every one according to his capacity, i.e. according to his heart's estimation, as explained in the holy Zohar on the verse, \"Her husband is known in the gates (she'arim), . . .\""

                "We learned [in Niddah, end of chapter 3 (30b)]: \"An oath is issued to him, be righteous, and be not wicked, and even if everyone in the world tells you 'you're righteous,\" view yourself as (someone who's) wicked.'\" But one has to understand this. For have we not learned, \"Do not consider yourself wicked.\"! What's more, if one will be wicked in his own eyes he will feel embittered and deppressed, and he will be unable to serve G-d with joyful and a glad heart. And (even) if he will not be grieved by this at all, this could lead to frivolity, G-d forbid!", 
                "So the matter is as follows: We find in the Talmud five different types of people. A righteous person [tzaddik] who has good, a righteous person [tzaddik] who has evil; a wicked person [rasha] who has good, a wicked person [rasha] who has evil; and a intermediate person [beinoni]. ", 
                "And the sages explained in the Talmud, that the 'righteous person who has good' is the perfectly righteous person [or the perfect tzaddik]; the 'righteous person who has evil' is a person who is righteous but not completely [or the imperfect tzaddik]. And in Raya Mehemna he explains, that [in the description of] 'a righteous person who has evil' [not that there is something evil about him, rather] - that any evil within him is completely mastered by his goodness, etc.", 
                "And in the Talmud: \"The righteous [tzaddik] are judged by their good inclination etc., the wicked [rasha] are judged by their evil inclination, while the intermediate person [beinoni] is judged by both inclinations etc. Said Raba, 'For example, I am an  intermediate person [beinoni].' Said Abaye to him, 'Our master has left no life for any creature.'\"", 
                "So to understand all of this clearly. and also to understand a statement of Job's, \"Master of the Universe, You have created righteous men and You have created wicked men.\" [how can this be correct] when righteousness and wickedness are not predestined?", 
                "Also, we need to understand what is the true nature of this intermediate person [beinoni]. For certainly he is not someone whose deeds are half meritorious and half sinful [that he spent half his life doing good and half his life doing evil] for if that were the case how could Raba mistake himself for an intermediate person [beinoni]? It is known that his lips never ceased reciting words of Torah, to the extent that even the Angel of Death could not overwhelm him. Then how would he make such a mistake to consider himself [an intermediate person [beinoni] unless 'intermediate' means fully righteous in behavior and not] half sinful? ", 
                "Additionally, [an intermediate person cannot be one who is half sinful, for] in the moment that one sins he is considered completely wicked [complete rasha]. (If afterwards he returns to righteousness [he repents from his sin]  he is considered completely righteous.) Even someone who violates a minor rabbinic prohibition is considered wicked [rasha]", 
                "This being  so, we must conclude that the Beinoni is not even guilty of the sin of neglecting to study torah. This is why rabbah mistook himself for a Beinoni.",

ChaBaD [the intellectual faculties] are called \"mothers\" and source of the middot, for the latter are \"offspring\" of the former.", 
                "The explanation of the matter is as follows:", 
                "The intellect of the rational soul, which is the faculty that conceives any thing, is given the appellation of chochmah—כ\"ח מ\"ה— the \"potentiality\" of \"what is.\" When one brings forth this power from the potential into the actual, that is, when [a person] cogitates with his intellect in order to understand a thing truly and profoundly as it evolves from the concept which he has conceived in his intellect, this is called binah. These [chochmah and binah] are the very \"father\" and \"mother\" which give birth to love of G‑d, and awe and dread of Him.", 
                "For when the intellect in the rational soul deeply contemplates and immerses itself exceedingly in the greatness of G‑d, how He fills all worlds and encompasses all worlds, and in the presence of Whom everything is considered as nothing— there will be born and aroused in his mind and thought the emotion of awe for the Divine Majesty, to fear and be humble before His blessed greatness, which is without end or limit, and to have the dread of G‑d in his heart. Next, his heart will glow with an intense love, like burning coals, with a passion, desire and longing, and a yearning soul, towards the greatness of the blessed En Sof. This constitutes the culminating passion of the soul, of which Scripture speaks, as \"My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth,.. .\" and \"My soul thirsteth for G‑d,...\" and \"My soul thirsteth for Thee....\" This thirst is derived from the element of Fire, which is found in the divine soul. As students of natural science affirm, and so it is in Etz Chayim, the element of Fire is in the heart, whilst the source of [the element of] Water and moisture is in the brain, which is explained in Etz Chayim, Portal 50, to refer to the faculty of chochmah, called \"The water of the divine soul.\" The rest of the middot are all offshoots of fear and love and their derivations, as is explained elsewhere.", 
                "Da'at, the etymology of which is to be found in the verse: \"And Adam knew (yada) Eve,\" implies attachment and union. That is, one binds his mind with a very firm and strong bond to, and firmly fixes his thought on, the greatness of the blessed En sof, without diverting his mind [from Him]. For even one who is wise and understanding of the greatness of the blessed En Sof, will not— unless he binds his knowledge and fixes his thought with firmness and perseverence— produce in his soul true love and fear, but only vain fancies. Therefore da'at is the basis of the middot and the source of their vitality; it contains chesed and gevurah, that is to say, love with its offshoots and fear with its offshoots.\n"

And this name Elokim is a shield and a covering for the name Hava'ye, to conceal the light and life-force which flows from the name Hava'ye and brings creation into existence from naught, so that it [the light and life-force] should not be revealed to the creatures, who thereby would become absolutely nullified.", 
                "This quality of Gevurah and Tzimtzum is also a quality of Chesed for through it [Tzimtzum and Gevurah] the world is built. And this is the quality of Gevurah A which is included in Chesed.", 
                "From the inclusion of the attributes one in the other, it is evident that \"He and His attributes are One,\" for since they are in a complete unity with Him, they therefore unite with each other and are comprised of each other. As Eliyahu said, \"And You are He who binds [the attributes] together and unites them...; and aside from You there is no unity among those above ...\"", 
                "This, then, is the meaning of that which is written \"And take unto your heart that Hava'ye is Elokim\"— that is, these two names are actually one, for even the name Elokim, which contracts and conceals the light is a quality of Chesed, just as the name Havaye. For the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, unite with Him in a complete unity, and \"He and His Name are One,\" for His attributes are His Names. Since this is so, you will consequently know that \"In the heavens above and on the earth below, en od— there is nothing else [besides G‑d].\" This means that even the material earth, which appears to the eyes of all to be actually existing is naught and complete nothingness in relation to the Holy One, blessed be He. For the name Elokim conceals and contracts [the light and life-force] only for the lower [creatures], but not for the Holy One, blessed be He, since He and His Name Elokim are One. Therefore, even the earth and that which is below it are naught and complete nothingness in relation to the Holy One, blessed be He, and are not called by any name at all, not even the name od (else) which is an expression indicating a secondary, subordinate status, as the statement of our Sages of blessed memory, \"Yehudah v'od likrah;\" [unlike] the body which is subordinate to the soul and life-force within it [and is referred to as od]. [And this is the meaning of the verse: \"I will praise Hava'ye with my life (soul) and will sing to Elokim b'odi\" (with my body). For the soul is derived from the name Hava'ye and the od, which is the body, the subordinate (of the soul), from the name Elokim.] For the soul does not bring the body into existence ex nihilo, [hence it can be called od in relation to the soul], but the Holy One, blessed be He, Who brings everything into existence ex nihilo— everything is absolutely nullified in relation to Him, just as the light of the sun [is nullified] in the sun.", 
                "Therefore, it was necessary for Scripture to warn, \"And know this day and take unto your heart...\", so that it should not enter your mind that the heavens and all their host and the earth and all therein are separate entities in themselves, and that the Holy One, blessed be He, fills the whole world— in the same way as the soul is invested in the body— and causes the flow of the \"vegetative force\" into the earth, and the force of motion into the celestial spheres, and moves them and directs them according to His Will, just as the soul moves the body and directs it according to its will. In truth, however, the analogy bears no similarity whatsoever to the object of comparison since the soul and the body are actually separate from each other in their very sources. The source of the body and its essence comes into being not from the soul, but from the seed of his father and mother; and even afterwards, his growth is not from the soul alone, but through his mother's eating and drinking all the nine months [of gestation], and subsequently through his own eating and drinking. This is not so, however, in the case of heaven and earth, for their very being and essence was brought into existence from naught and absolute nothingness, solely through the \"Word of G‑d\" and the \"Breath of His mouth,\" may He be blessed. And the word of G‑d still stands forever [in all created things], and flows into them continuously at every instant and continuously brings them into existence from nothing, just as, for example, the coming into existence of the light from the sun within the very globe of the sun. Hence, in reality, they [heaven and earth] are completely nullified in relation to the \"Word of G‑d\" and the \"Breath of His mouth,\" may He be blessed, which are unified with His Essence and Being, may He be blessed, as will be explained later, just as the light of the sun is nullified in the sun.", 
                "Yet these are His Restraining Powers, to hide and conceal, through the attribute of Gevurah and Tzimtzum, the life-force which flows into them, so that heaven and earth and all their host should appear as if they were independently existing entities. However, the Tzimtzum and concealment is only for the lower [worlds], but in relation to the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Everything before Him is considered as actually naught,\" just as the light of the sun in the sun. And the attribute of Gevurah does not, Heaven forfend, conceal for Him, may He be blessed, for it is not an independent entity— since Hava'ye is Elokim."

But surely with Him the distinction of \"upper\" and \"lower\" has no validity, for He pervades all worlds equally.

For the change relates only to those who receive His blessed life-force and light, which they receive through many \"garments\" which conceal and obscure His blessed light, as is written, \"For no man shall see Me and live,\" and, as our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have explained it, that even angels, who are called chayyot, cannot see Him....This is the concept of the Hishtalshelut (downward gradation) of the worlds and their descent, degree by degree, through a multitude of \"garments\" which screen the light and life that emanate from Him, until there was created this material and gross world, the lowest in degree, than which there is none lower in the aspect of concealment of His blessed light; [a world of] doubled and redoubled darkness, so much so that it is full of kelipot and the sitra achra which oppose the very G‑dhead, saying: \"I am, and there is nothing else besides me.\" Clearly, the purpose of the Hishtalshelut of the worlds and their descent, degree by degree, is not for the sake of the higher worlds, because for them this is a descent from the light of His blessed Countenance. But the ultimate purpose [of creation] is this lowest world, for such was His blessed will that He shall have satisfaction when the sitra achra is subdued and the darkness is turned to light, so that the Divine light of the blessed En Sof shall shine forth in the place of the darkness and sitra achra throughout this world, all the more strongly and intensely, with the excellence of light emerging from darkness, than its effulgence in the higher worlds, where it shines through \"garments\" and in concealment of the Countenance, which screen and conceal the light of the blessed En Sof, in order that they should not dissolve out of existence. For this purpose, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Israel the Torah which is called \"might\" and \"strength,\" as the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, that the Almighty puts strength into the righteous in order that they may receive their reward in the hereafter, without being nullified in their very existence, in the Divine light that will be revealed to them in the hereafter without any cloak, as is written, \"No longer shall thy Teacher hide Himself (literally: He will not conceal Himself from thee with robe and garment) ... but thine eyes shall see thy Teacher.\" It is also written, \"For they shall see eye to eye,.. .\" and, \"The sun shall be no more thy light by day ..., but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light....\" ", 
                "It is well known that the Messianic Era, and especially the time of the Resurrection of the Dead, is the fulfillment and culmination of the creation of the world, for which purpose it was originally created.", 
                "Note: The receiving of the reward is essentially in the seventh millennium, as is stated in Likutei Torah of Rabbi Isaac Luria, of blessed memory.", 
                "Something of this revelation has already been experienced on earth, at the time of the Giving of the Torah, as is written, \"Unto thee it was showed, that thou mightest know that the Lord He is G‑d; there is naught else beside Him\"— \"It was showed \" verily with physical vision, as is written, \"And all the people saw the thunderings\"— \"They saw what is [normally] heard.\" And the Rabbis, of blessed memory, explained, \"They looked eastwards and heard the speech issuing forth: 'I am,' etc., and so [turning] towards the four points of the compass, and upwards and downwards,\" as is also explained in the Tikunim that \"There was no place from which He did not speak unto them....\" This was so because of the revelation of His blessed will in the Decalogue constituting the epitome of the whole Torah, which is the inwardness of His blessed will and wisdom, wherein there is no concealment of the Countenance at all, as is written, \"For in the light of Thy Countenance hast Thou given us the Law of life.\" Therefore they [the Israelites at Sinai] repeatedly expired out of existence, as the Rabbis have taught that \"At each [Divine] utterance their soul took flight,... but the Holy One, blessed be He, restored it to them with the dew with which He will revive the dead.\" This is the dew of the Torah which is called \"might,\" as the Rabbis have said, \"Everyone who occupies himself with the Torah is revived by the dew of the Torah....\" ", 
                "Later, however, the sin [of the Golden Calf] caused both them and the world to become gross again— until \"The end of days,\" when the dross of the body and of the world will be purified, and they will be able to apprehend the revealed Divine light which will shine forth to Israel by means of the Torah, called \"might.\" And, as a result of the overflow of the illumination on Israel, the darkness of the gentiles will also be lit up, as is written, \"And the nations shall walk by thy light,...\" and, \"O, house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord\" ; again, \"And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see together,...\"; and, \"To go into the holes of the rocks, and into the clefts of the boulders, for fear of the Lord and for the glory of His majesty.\" And as we pray, \"Shine forth in the splendour and excellence of Thy might upon all the inhabitants of the world....\"",

                "At the time the First Temple stood, in which the Ark and Tables [of the Decalogue] were housed in the Holy of Holies, the Shechinah, i.e. Malchut d'Atzilut, that is, the aspect of the \"revealed\" light of the blessed En Sof, dwelled there and was clothed in the Ten Commandments, far higher and stronger, and with a greater and mightier revelation, than its revelation in the shrines of the Holy of Holies above in the upper worlds. For the Ten Commandments are the \"All-embracing principles of the whole Torah,\" which comes from the Higher Wisdom, that is far higher than the world of manifestation. In order to engrave them on material tablets of stone it (the Shechinah) did not descend degree by degree, parallel to the order of descent of the worlds down to this material world. For this material world functions through the garment of material nature, while the Tables [of the Decalogue] are \"The work of G‑d, and the writing is the writing of G‑d,\" beyond the nature of this material world which is derived from the effulgence of the Shechinah in the shrine of the Holy of Holies of Asiyah (\"Action\"), whence issues light and vitality to the world of Asiyah, in which this our world also is contained.", 
                "But the category of the Higher Wisdom of Atzilut, consisting of the totality of the Torah as it is epitomized in the Decalogue, has clothed itself in Malchut of Atzilut and of Beriah alone, and they alone, united as they are with the light of the blessed En Sof that is within them, are referred to as the \"Shechinah\" which rested in the Holy of Holies of the First Temple, through its clothing itself in the Ten Commandments, which were engraved in the Tables [reposing] in the Ark, by miraculous means and by the work of the Living G‑d (this being the \"hidden\" world which nests in the world of Beriah as is known to those familiar with the Esoteric Discipline).", 
                "As for the Second Temple, in which did not repose the Ark and Tables [of the Decalogue], our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said that the Shechinah did not abide there. This refers to the category of the Shechinah which used to abide in the First Temple— which was not of the ordinary descent of the worlds. But in the Second Temple it abided according to the order of gradual descent, of Malchut d'Atzilut vested in Malchut d'Beriah and the latter in Malchut d'Yetzirah, and the latter in the shrine of the Holy of Holies of Asiyah which in turn was clothed in the Holy of Holies of the Temple here below. In it rested the Shechinah, i.e. Malchut d'Yetzirah which was clothed in the Holy of Holies of Asiyah.", 
                "Therefore no man was permitted to enter there, except the High Priest on the Day of Atonement. However, since the Temple was destroyed, there remains to the blessed Holy One but \"The four cubits of Halachah alone.\" Hence each individual who sits by himself and occupies himself in the Torah, the Shechinah is with him, as is stated in the first chapter of Berachot. The phrase \"The Shechinah is with him\" means in the order of the gradual descent and investment of Malchut d'Atzilut in Malchut d'Beriah, and Yetzirah and Asiyah. For the 613 commandments of the Torah are by and large active precepts, as are also those which are fulfilled by word and thought, such as Torah study and Grace after meals and the recital of the Shema and Prayer, for it has been ruled that contemplation has not the validity of speech, and one has not fulfilled one's obligation by contemplation and kavanah alone, until he gives utterance with his lips; and it has been ruled that the motion of the lips is considered an \"action.\"", 
                "The 613 commandments of the Torah, together with the seven commandments of our Rabbis, combine to total the numerical equivalent of כתר (\"crown\") which is the blessed Ratzon Elyon (the \"Supernal Will\"), which is clothed in His blessed Wisdom, and they are united with the light of the blessed En Sof in a perfect union. \"The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth,\" which refers to the Oral Law that is derived from the Higher Wisdom, as is written in the Zohar, \"The Father [chochmah] begat the daughter [i.e. Malchut, the Oral Law].\"", 
                "And this is what the Yenuka meant when he said that \"The Supernal light that is kindled on one's head, namely, the Shechinah, requires oil,\" that is, to be clothed in wisdom, which is called \"oil from the holy anointing,\" as is explained in the Zohar, that \"these are the good deeds,\" namely, the 613 commandments, which derive from His blessed wisdom. Thereby the light of the Shechinah can cling to the wick, i.e. the vivifying soul in the body, which is metaphorically called a \"wick.\" For just as in the case of a material candle, the light shines by virtue of the annihilation and burning of the wick turning to fire, so does the light of the Shechinah rest on the divine soul as a result of the annihilation of the animal soul and its transformation \"From darkness to light and from bitterness to sweetness\" in the case of the righteous, or at least through the destruction of its garments, which are thought, speech and action, and their transformation from the darkness of the kelipot to the Divine light of the blessed En Sof, which is clothed and united in the thought, speech and action of the 613 commandments of the Torah, in the case of benonim. For as a result of the transformation of the animal soul, originating from the kelipat nogah, [a transformation] from darkness to light, and so forth, there is brought about toe so-called \"ascent of the feminine waters\" to draw the light of the Shechinah, i.e. the category of the \"revealed\" light of the blessed En Sof— over one's divine soul [principally dwelling] in the brain of the head. Thereby will also be clearly understood the text \"For the Lord Thy G‑d is a consuming fire\" as is explained elsewhere.",
