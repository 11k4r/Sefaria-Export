                "My beloved brothers and friends, from hidden love and revealed rebuke, let us dispute:", 
                "Remember the days of old, Consider the years of ages past. Was there ever such a thing, and where did you find this custom in all of the books of the Sages of Israel early and late to have the custom and decree to ask material advice about what to do in the issues of the material world, even from the great sages of Israel, the early ones like the Tanaim and Emoraim to whom no secrets were held back and the path of heaven was lit up for them, but only the prophets themselves, who were before Israel, like Samuel the visionary who Saul went  to to ask God about the asses that his father had lost!", 
                "For in truth, all of the issues of the human except for the words of Torah and the fear of heaven are only attainable through prophesy, and the sages do not have bread as our Rabbis said, \"Everything is in the hands of heaven except the fear of heaven,\" and \"Seven things are hidden... A person does not know how they will make a living... and when the kingdom of David will be restored...\" Behold they held these things equal to each other. And what it says in Isaiah \"A counselor and skilled artisan,\" and  also what our Rabbis said, \"and they benefit from them with counsel and insight,\" this is referring to words of Torah which are called \"insight.\" As our Rabbis said, \"a counselor, this is one who knows how to extend the years and fix the months...\" For the secret of the extension is called counsel and secret in the language of the Torah as it says in Sanhedrin 87, see what Rashi says there.", 
                "But I will say the truth to those who will hear me. For love distorts the line, and it is a covering for the eyes so that they will not see truth because of the great love they have of the life of the body for the sake of heaven to serve God with it in the flash of the fire and the great flame from the love of their souls for God. And therefore, they are rightly angered by the pain of the body (God forbid) and they are not able to accept it at all until they can pass them from their minds by pounding their legs from city to city to ask advice from afar and they do not pay attention to God, to return to Him with a lowly spirit and a subdued body to accept His rebuke with love for the one that God loves..."

                "We learned [in Niddah, end of chapter 3 (30b)]: \"An oath is issued to him, be righteous, and be not wicked, and even if everyone in the world tells you 'you're righteous,\" view yourself as (someone who's) wicked.'\" But one has to understand this. For have we not learned, \"Do not consider yourself wicked.\"! What's more, if one will be wicked in his own eyes he feel bad and be sad, and he will be unable to serve God with joy and a glad heart. And if he should not be grieved by this at all, this could lead to frivolity, G0d forbid!", 
                "So the matter is as follows: We find in the Talmud five different types of people. A righteous person [tzaddik] who has good, a righteous person [tzaddik] who has evil; a wicked person [rasha] who has good, a wicked person [rasha] who has evil; and a intermediate person [beinoni]. ", 
                "And the sages explained in the Talmud, that the 'righteous person who has good' is the perfectly righteous person [or the perfect tzaddik]; the 'righteous person who has evil' is a person who is righteous but not completely [or the imperfect tzaddik]. And in Raya Mehemna he explains, that [in the description of] 'a righteous person who has evil' [not that there is something evil about him, rather] - that any evil within him is completely mastered by his goodness, etc.", 
                "And in the Talmud: \"The righteous [tzaddik] are judged by their good inclination etc., the wicked [rasha] are judged by their evil inclination, while the intermediate person [beinoni] is judged by both inclinations etc. Said Raba, 'For example, I am an  intermediate person [beinoni].' Said Abaye to him, 'Our master has left no life for any creature.'\"", 
                "So to understand all of this clearly. and also to understand a  statement of Job's, \"Master of the Universe, You have created righteous men and You have created wicked men.\" [how can this be correct] when righteousness and wickedness are not predestined?", 
                "Also, we need to understand what is the true nature of this intermediate person [beinoni]. For certainly he is not someone whose deeds are half meritorious and half sinful [that he spent half his life doing good and half his life doing evil] for if that were the case how could Raba mistake himself for an intermediate person [beinoni]? It is known that his lips never ceased reciting words of Torah, to the extent that even the Angel of Death could not overwhelm him. Then how would he make such a mistake to consider himself [an intermediate person [beinoni] unless 'intermediate' means fully righteous in behavior and not] half sinful? ", 
                "Additionally, [an intermediate person cannot be one who is half sinful, for] in the moment that one sins he is considered completely wicked [complete rasha]. (If afterwards he returns to righteousness [he repents from his sin]  he is considered completely righteous.) Even someone who violates a minor rabbinic prohibition is considered wicked [rasha]", 
                "This being  so, we must conclude that the Beinoni is not even guilty of the sin of neglecting to study torah. This is why rabbah mistook himself for a Beinoni.",
