                "Another explanation: on Shabbat before Pesach, the Rav prayed Shacharit, and after prayer he removed the tallit and went outside. They thought he needed to use the toilet. When he was in the synagogue courtyard, he saw that they were bringing a bear, and youths were running after it as is usual. And he also went after it. After this, they brought the bear from the gate of the synagogue courtyard to the market. And he also followed. And it was very wondrous in the eyes of the people. And they brought the bear to the judge's house, and after this the bear broke the rope and seemed crazed. All the people who were following it fled because of the fear that it would run through the city and injure people.",
                "And the Rav stood in his place, and the bear ran through the judge's courtyard and entered its antechamber. And it opened the house's door by force, and the Ba'al SHem Tov immediately stood by the window to see what it would do to him. And many men, and the majority of the world, stood by the windows to see what the bear would do. Immediately the bear removed the table from its place, and picked up the floor, and dug in the dirt, until it found a dead mamzer concealed beneath the floor. And it took the mamzer from there in its two arms, and showed him to all. And the Rav cried that they were witnesses in Polish (\"pratest\", פראטעסט). For it was His will to bring forth evil mutterings on the Jews. And he returned to the synagogue to conclude the prayers. "
