                    "In the verse, 'Like the practice of the land of Egypt' etc., 'my judgements' etc., 'to follow/walk in them'. Rashi explains 'you are not permitted to be exempt' from them. As it's written 'like' the practice, not actually 'the practice' of the land of Egypt. Because the Bnei Yisroel were already a holy congregation and what is the relevance to warn them from acting like these sinners? But the explanation (comes to teach us) that there should not be any act of a Jew that is like/similar to the acts of the wicked that all their acts are for worldliness alone. Rather the Bnei Yisroel need to sanctify all their actions to cleave to the source of the life-force and to take from it life-force. Because the action needs to be only for the purpose that man 'walks' in the service of HaShem (may He be blessed) and simple Jews are directed to eat and drink to add strength in their service of the Creator which is also a general (form of) 'walking'. And what also of the righteous that all their actions are for the sake of Heaven, and so too with every commandment that a person does, it needs to be directed (one should perform it with the intent) that through this (the performance of the commandment) he will come to greater holiness that he could add at all times from one (spiritual) level to the next (spiritual) level. Like (the concept that fulfilment of a) 'commandment brings another commandment'. And it won't be that the commandment was done simply to be discharged from the obligation, rather on the contrary, that through the merit of this, one will receive (the opportunity for) other commandments, as it's written, that the reward for (fulfilling a) commandment is (the opportunity to fulfil another) commandment. And this is what it means 'to follow/walk in them' etc., and to take from them life-force as it's written 'and live (by) them' (or possibly, and life is within them)."

And there's a difficulty, that with one expression being said, according to Rashi, 'in this language and in this order'. And perhaps one could say that really these words are for women and those who are lacking understanding. They are only words of encouragement how the Holy One, blessed be He, brought us close and uplifted us. But people that understand, know that this is not a small thing and that they are receiving with this, a great and awesome yoke to serve the Creator of the world and to clarify his kingdom, may it be blessed, in the world. And therefore it says with this expression and in this order that it was revealed before Him, may He be blessed, that with this expression each person will continue according to their path. The women with encouragement. And the men with an awesome undertaking. And in the Gemora we also find a disagreement whether commandments were given to us to derive benefit from. And the law is that they weren't given to us to derive benefit from, as mentioned above. "

                    "\"And Mordechai returned to the gate of the king\" etc. Our sages say, may their memory be blessed, that he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. The explanation for 'and he returned' is that he returned in repentance. This is the way of the tzadik {righteous}, through which he is assisted by HaShem, may He be blessed. He subjugates himself further through the shame from before Him, may He be blessed. And Mordechai regretted that he caused the whole decree. And now HaShem, may He be blessed, did a kindness like this for him. He became further ashamed. And he returned/repented. Because certainly, repentance through the shame is not like that like before {one has shame}. That there are two (ways of gaining) humility. Firstly, through worthlessness {that a person understands that he is worthless}. And the second, through greatness as it is written elsewhere {that a person realises his greatness - who he is and what he has - and  realises that he doesn't deserve  any of it}. And this is the difference between a tzadik {righteous person} and a rasha {a wicked person} as it is written \"and Haman went out etc.\" ... \"happy and with a good heart\" because of the feast. And this was his downfall. But by Mordechai it says 'and he returned/repented' as written above. Furthermore it is apparent that Mordechai knew that HaShem, may He be blessed, will certainly help the Jewish people as it is written \"relief and deliverance\" etc. And so it's written \"and he knew all that had happened\" etc. However through this way, that all tzadikim {righteous}, that even though they know of the salvation, nevertheless they are able to cry out with a truly complete heart as if they didn't know. And someone that isn't {on that level}, the true salvation isn't shown to him. And this is dependent on complete faith that one nullifies his intellect to HaShem, may He be blessed, and he knows and believes that there is no contradiction in any of this, that the salvation arrives through the outcry of man. Even though HaShem, may He be blessed, will not forsake the Jewish people, without question. Nevertheless it is necessary to cry out in a time of distress as it is written \"a time of distress\" etc. and from that, one will be saved."

                    "Rashi quotes \"Rabbi Yitzhak said: The Torah should have started at \"From this very month...\"...the first mitzvah...[because of] 'the strength of His deeds...\". One must understand the solution given regarding all of the Torah portions from Bereshit until \"...this very month\". The interpretation of the matter is that the essence of the Torah is the mitzvot--this is the written Torah--but the Holy Blessed One wanted to clarify that this world and the entire Creation [exists] because of the 'power of Torah', as it says \"B-reishit\": He looked within the Torah and created the world [according to it].\" And this matter [is in contrast] with Oral Torah, which is dependent on human activity. Thus, all the Torah portions concerned with the stories of forefathers [are there] to show how Torah was created by their deeds. This is what is meant by \"the strength of His deeds\"--the power that the Holy Blessed One suffused within Creation. This is why it is called \"the work/deed of Creation\" to declare that the world was created with ten utterances, and the life-force of the world by means of the Torah. The task of humanity, then, is to understand that every deed is a result of the Holy Blessed One's life-force. When a person performs any action, it is [only] because of the power of Torah to fulfill the will of the Creator, thus renewing the light hidden within Creation. This is hinted at in the verse \"I have put my words in your mouth...who laid the foundations of the earth and say to Zion 'You are my people'.\" The sages interpret the verse: Don't read ami/my people--rather immi/with me, as a partner in the work of Creation. The Zohar interprets 'Zion' as the inner point within all things as a imprint and sign to remember that the Holy One is the [the source] all things. This is the life-force which animates all things. The person who clings to this inner point and all of His life-force which flows from this point becomes a partner in the work of Creation. As a result of this ...\"in order that He might give them the inheritance of the nations”--an inheritance without restraints. When a person joins the natural world to its active potential, nature cannot obscure the power of holiness. "

                    "This is really about the Oral Torah. The Kadosh Barukh Hu wants the children of Israel to expand the Written Torah through their deeds--for we know that the deeds of the righteous are “Torah”. Through the deeds of Boaz and Ruth, a scroll was produced by Divine Guidance. ", 
                    "It is written “And Elohim said...saying”, meaning: the children of Israel said words like these to themselves. It’s also written “who gave us a Torah of truth, and within us, planted eternal life”--this refers to Oral Torah,  the unique quality of Torah which is Israel’s. They have a unique intellectual approach to understand secrets within the Torah which are hidden and not explicit within the Torah itself. ", 
                    "This itself is the matter of Boaz, whose name means Bo Oz--strength within him--that is to say, he had deep faith in the words of the Sages who explained “an Amonite--excluding an Amonitess”. He had no doubt in the matter, like Ploni did who said “lest I endanger my inheritance”. On the contrary! He was ecstatic to show that the interpretation of the Rabbis was the Torah given on Sinai. ", 
                    "“Trust in the Sages” is the foundation of Oral Torah, and this is what is meant by “Truth and Trust”. Written Torah is explicitly exoteric. Yet, it is the will of the Divine that in this downcast world, Israel achieve ‘truth’ by way of ‘trust’.", 
                    "The ego gives itself over to remove that trust from a person. It makes it seem in one’s eyes as though they are alienated from Hashem Yisbarakh, and tells them that it is arrogant to even try to seek Hashem Yisbarakh in silent prayer, and the like. But the truth is the exact opposite! Seeking God at all fosters the fear of Heaven. ", 
                    "One should contemplate to see that it is in no way disgraceful to contemplate the trivialities of the world for “the entire world is filled with His Presence”. How could someone be ashamed of pondering that what is His true desire?", 
                    "Now what emerges is the reason that Israel wished to hear the first two commandments from God Himself: to believe the truth of God as the lifeforce of every human being. As it says “I am the Lord your God”--literally, all of your lifeforce. That’s why it is addressed to the second person singular, for the innermost life force of every Jew is is the same point which gives life to all of creation as it is says “You ‘give life’ to all things”. Thus our Sages taught: A person should always see themselves as if the Holy Presence abides in one’s insides.”, for a holy person should be able to uncover the holy presence within themselves. A person doesn’t create something new by some sort of deed, rather she reveals the innermost life force within her as it says “And He breathed into his mouth life breath”. If a person can believe in this life force, to not forget about it,  and always strive to cleave to the root of this life force, they can merit the “truth by means of trust”, mentioned above. ", 
                    "One should believe that as the Holy One said “Let there be light”, that the light can shine one more day. Just as God said “I am the Lord your God”, there is a divine life force in every Jew. \n"
