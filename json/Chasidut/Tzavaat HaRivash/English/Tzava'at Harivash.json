            "Whatever you see, remember the Holy One, blessed be He. Thus [when seeing an aspect of] love, remember the love of God; and with [an aspect of] fear remember the fear of God, as this is elaborated in various sources. Even when going to the privy have in mind “I am separating the bad from the good,” with the good remaining for the Divine service. This is the concept of yichudim (unifications). Likewise, when going to sleep think that your mental faculties go to the Holy One, blessed be He, and will be strengthened for the Divine service. "
