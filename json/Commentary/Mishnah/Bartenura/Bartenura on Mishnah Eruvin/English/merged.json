Anything that has in its circumference three handbreadths, which requires a string of three handbreadths to encircle it around, it is known that it has a width (diameter) of one handbreadth, if you divide [it]. As so do we find with the basin that Shlomo made (II Chronicles 4:2), \"ten ells from its edge to its edge and five ells of height and a line of thirty ells encircling it around.\" Hence for every ell in width (diameter), there are three ells in circumference.
