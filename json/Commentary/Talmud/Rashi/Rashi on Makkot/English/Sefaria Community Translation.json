This is the wording of the baraisa, to say, \"I do not know where one is scriptually warned\", therefore the Torah teaches us, \"he may not proceed etc.\", and the Gemarah was not quiet yet in finishing the matter, rather it proceeded and asked why does it say \"I do not know\"? Why, bodily tumah is explicitly written in the Torah, \"the soul that touched it. etc. may not eat from the holy unless he washed his flesh in water\", and we say in Yevamos, that this verse was said regarding maaser sheni, that he immersed, ascended and eats etc."
