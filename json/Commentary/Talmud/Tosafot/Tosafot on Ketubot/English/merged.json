                "<b>The bride as she is:</b> And if she has a blemish, they are quiet and they do not praise it. And also (another possibility is) they praise her with something pleasant that she has - for example, [he praises her] about her eyes or her hands if they are beautiful. And Beit Hillel says that you praise her altogether, as when we mention that which she has to be praised, it implies that the rest is to be denigrated. "
