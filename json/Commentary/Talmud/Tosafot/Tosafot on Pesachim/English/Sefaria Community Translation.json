                "Mishna - \"On the night of the 14th, we search for hametz\". Rashi explains the reason is so that one does not transgress the Torah prohibitions of seeing and finding hametz. This leads to a difficulty to the position of Rav Yitzchak the Elder - Since he requires \"Bitul\" (Annulment) as it mentions in the Talmud (Pesachim 6B) - \"One who searches for hametz needs to annul.\" From the Torah, annulment is acceptable to avoid the Biblical transgression. ", 
                "Why did the Hachamim require searching at all? It seems to the opinion of Rav Yitzchak the Elder that even though annulment is sufficient, the Rabbis were stringent  to require the searching of hametz and to destroy it so that no person should come to eat hametz on Passover. Another reason - The Torah was stringent on the finding or seeing hametz in your possession, therefore, the Hachamim were stringent on requiring the individual to search and destroy even if he annuled his possession of hametz because one may come to eat hametz."

And similarly, in the Megilla, through Esther, and in Chanuka, through Judith. And it is difficult, since \"even\" implies that they aren't the main thing. And also, the version in the Jerusalem Talmud is \"even they were in that same uncertainty,\" implying in that danger of \"to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish\" (Esther 3:13). And this that we say that they [women] are exempt from [the commandment of] sukka, even though that even they were in that same miracle, is [based on] \"that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths\" (Leviticus 23:43), there, is regarding a positive Torah commandment. However, regarding the four cups, which is rabbinic, they established it also for women, since they were in that same miracle."
