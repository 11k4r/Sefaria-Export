                "The Lord loves the gates of Zion – It says ‘gates’ because the elders and the wise sit in the gates, as it says “…up to the gate, to the elders…” (Deuteronomy 25:7) and so too in the words of Boaz which describe the elders who were at the gate. (Ruth 4:11) Even though God loves all of the dwelling places of Yaakov, as it says “How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!” (Numbers 24:6) nevertheless He lowves the gates of Zion more because there the wise are occupied with the service of Gd."
