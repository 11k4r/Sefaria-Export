                "\"Bechol Levavcha\" according to the midrash (Sifri), the heart is mentioned here because it is the force that desires (lit.), as it is written [in Tehillim 21:3], \"the desire of his heart You gave to him,\" [and also is written in Mishlei 6:25], \"do not covet her beauty in your heart.\" If so, \"bechol nafshecha\" - the \"nefesh\"* is [the organ that] reasons, as it is written [in Shmuel 1 25:29] \"the Nefesh of my master shall be bound up in the binding of life.\" It is also like the words of our sages who expound in the Gemara [in Brachot 54]", 
                "**Note that Nefesh is commonly translated as \"soul\" but is more properly rendered in the original as \"life\". However, the use here in the midrash is referring to what we might refer to as a person's \"mind\" but seems to bring a proof quote referring to David's \"life.\""

                "you shall inquire after His dwelling – You will come to Him from faraway places and ask, where is the way to the House of Gd? A each one will say to his fellow “…come, let us go up to the Lord's mount, to the house of the God of Jacob…” (Yeshayahu 2:3) Just as “They shall inquire of Zion; their faces are directed hitherward…” (Yirmiyahu 50:5) And in the Sifre (Re’eh 8) it says: ‘you shall inquire,’ this means you should inquire from the mouth of the prophet. Perhaps one should wait until the prophet speaks to them? The Torah says ‘you shall inquire after His dwelling and come there.’ Seek and find and afterwards the prophet will say to you, and so you find with David, etc… In the way of true understanding ‘you shall inquire after His dwelling’ means you shall seek His glory, ‘and come there’ to see the face of the Master, the Lord Gd of Israel. It is from here that the Sages employed the word shechina."

                "... In explanation of the plain meaning of the text they said “You shall set a king over you, one whom the Lord, your God, chooses…” (Devarim 17:15) and not one that the Lord your God despises. For he chose Israel, therefore the one who reigns should be from among His chosen and not from among the nations whom He hates. My opinion of the plain meaning of ‘whom the Lord chooses’ is that anyone who rules over a nation is Divinely sanctioned, as it is written “…the Most High rules over the kingdom of man, and to whom He wishes, He gives it.” (Daniel 4:29) The Sages also taught ‘even the superintendent over a well is appointed from heaven.’ (Baba Batra 91b) It says ‘you shall set a king over you,’ that is whomsoever has been decreed from heaven to reign, be he from the smallest tribe of Israel and its youngest family - but a foreigner will never be king over you. This is also the plain meaning of “…the place which the Lord your God shall choose…” (Devarim 12:5) that anywhere which the Holy Temple of God is built is from the will of God.  "

                "So that his heart not become haughty over his brothers: here is hinted in the Torah the prohibition of arrogance, because the Torah restrains the king from arrogance and haughtiness of heart, and how much more so the others that would not be fitting for this--because for one who would be fitting for raising and aggrandizing, it warns him that his heart must be low and humble like all his lesser brothers. Because arrogance is a character trait which is disgusting and abhorrent by Hashem, even in a king, because to Hashem alone is the greatness and highness, and to Him alone is the praise, and only through Him can a man boast, as the topic is explained by Shlomo Hamelech (Mishlei): The abhorrence of Hashem is all who are haughty of heart, and it is written (Yirmiyahu): but only through this should a man boast: of knowing Me..."

                "<b>If the nest of a bird chances to be in front of you:</b> Also this commandment is explained by \"it and its son do not slaughter on one day\" (Leviticus 22:28); since the reason in both of them is that we should not have a cruel heart and [then] not have mercy, or that the verse should not permit us to be destructive to destroy the species, even though it allowed slaughter within that specie. And behold, one who kills the mother and the children on one day or takes them when they are 'free to fly' is as if he cuts off that specie. And the teacher (Rambam) in the Guide for the Perplexed 3:48 wrote that the reason of sending [the mother away from] the nest and the reason of  \"it and its son do not slaughter on one day\" is to prohibit killing the child in the eyes of the mother, as animals have great concern about this. And there is no difference between the concern of a person and the concern of animals for their children, since the love of a mother and 'the appeal of the children of its belly' does not stem from the intellect and the [faculty of] speech, but rather it is from the effects of the faculty of thought that is found in animals just as it is found in man. And if [it is as Rambam claims], the main prohibition of 'it and its son' is only [in the sequence] of its son and it, but [in other circumstances] it is all a distancing [of that main prohibition]. And more correct is [that the reason for the commandment is] so that we will not become cruel. And the teacher said: And don't answer me from the statement of the sages [that comes to explain] (Berakhot 33b), \"We silence the one who says, 'Your mercy reaches the nest of the bird.' [is because this commandment is a decree that has nothing to do with mercy],\" as this is one of two explanations - the explanation of the one to whom it appears that there is no reason for the commandments except for the will of the Creator - but we hold of the second explanation, [according to which] there should be an explanation for all of the commandments. And a further challenge to him is that which he found in Bereshit Rabbah 44:1, \"And so what does the Holy One, blessed be He, care whether he slaughters from [the front of] the neck or slaughters from the back - behold, the commandments were only given to purify the creations through them, as it is stated (Proverbs 30:5), 'Every word of the Lord is purified.'\" And this matter that the teacher asserted is very lucid regarding commandments that have a reason, as there is in each one a reason and a purpose and a refinement for the person, besides their reward from their Commander, may He be blessed. And the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, have already said (Sanhedrin 21b), \"For what were the reasons of the Torah not revealed, etc.\" and they expounded (Pesachim 119a), \"'Ancient covering' (Isaiah 23:18) - this is the one who reveals things that were covered by the One of ancient days; and what are they? The reasons of the Torah."

                "Because they met you not with bread and with water we find (Deut. 2:28-29) \"Thou shalt sell me food for money that I might eat and give me water for money that I might drink ... as the children of Esau who dwell in Se'ir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar\" and many say that they did not go forth to them, but Israel bought from them, and this is foolishness, because it is sufficient for the camp that they are sold food when they want to buy it, and also because Israel did enter the border of Moab and the Moabites took out bread and water for them in exchange for money, and the text will tell that the Moabites did as the sons of Esau did, and why should the Moabite be forever banished for this and the Edomite not be so despised, and Rabbi Avraham says (Deut. 2:29) that the reason it says \"as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me\" on the passage through their country on the way (Deut. 2:27) but did not sell them bread and water since they passed Har Seir and Ar, only the king of Edom did not allow them to pass through the land in which he dwells, and this is what it says (Num. 20:18) \"you will not pass through me\" and this too is foolishness because they said to the king of Edom  We will pass through your land and Edom refused to let Israel pass through their borders (Num. 20:21) thus they did not at all enter the border of Edom, and thus it says (Num. 21:4) \"They travelled from Hor Hahar through the Red Sea to circle the land of Edom\" because they needed to return through the Red Sea from Hor Hahar which is on the border of the land of Edom and they did not enter the land of Edom at all, and Yiftach said in his explanation (Judges 11:16-18) \"But when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh; then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying: Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh; Then he walked through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they pitched on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.\" Here it is explicit that they did not enter at all into the land of Edom nor into the land of Moab and if they had entered there they would have been sold bread and water since it is not the custom to allow a people's army to pass through the land and not have bread and water sold to them, and it seems to me that the pasuk distanced these two brothers who recieved kindness from Avraham who saved their father and mother from the sword and cativity (Gen. 14:16) and in whose merit God sent them from the destruction (Gen. 19:29) and they owed kindness to Israel, but they did them an ill turn, the one by hiring Bilam ben Be'or, and those are the Moabites, and the other who did not recieve them with bread and water when Israel approached them, as it says (Deut. 2:18-19) you are passing today the border of Moav, Ar, and approaching Bnei Ammon, and here the verse warns them (Deut. 2:19) Don't harass them and don't contend with them and they didn't welcome them at all, since then the verse would have said \"as the sons of Esau, the Moabites and the Ammonites did\", but the Ammonites are not mentioned since they did not welcome them, and thus Ammon was more wicked than the others, since the sons of Esau and the Moabites, when they knew that Israel would not contend with them, brought out bread and water outside their borders, and Ammon did not deign to do so, and this is the reason for |\"who did not welcome them\", that they did not go forth towards them with bread and water as the others did, and therefore the verse mentioned the \"Ammonite\" first, and mentioned his crime first, that they didn't welcome them, and only then mentioned the \"Moabite\" and their sin. Chazal learned (Yebamot 76) an Ammonite male, and not an Ammonite femal, a Moabite male and not a Moabite female since the way of the man is to go forth, and the way of the woman is not to go forth to bring food outside the borders of the country, and it is also written in the Yerushalmi ( Yebamot perek 8 halacha 3) and in Rut Rabati (4:8) since the way  of the man is to hire, and it is not the way of the woman to hire."

                "The Lord's beloved one shall dwell securely beside Him – Benyamin is called the Lord’s beloved, and it is said of him that he is the beloved of the Lord and will dwell in his land trusting in Gd, and the Lord will protect him all his days and cause His Presence to dwell in his land. Between his shoulders – this hints at what our Rabbis expounded (Zevachim 54b). In the way of truth, the love of Gd will dwell upon Benyamin and this will be Benyamin’s surety, that he “Trust in the Lord forever, for in Yah the Lord, is the Rock of eternity.” (Yeshayahu 26:4) He will protect and shield Benyamin all day and they will not be ashamed in the moment of trouble, and between the shoulders of Benyamin He will dwell forever. It is from here that Shlomo was called “…Yedidiah (beloved of the Lord) for the Lord's sake.” (Shmuel II 12:25) He built His beloved dwelling place (comp. Tehillim 84:2), just as he was also called Shlomo, in order to say that his quality was wholeness in peace and thefeore it was spelled with a Hebrew letter hey at the end. It says in the midrash of R’ Nechunyah be Hakanah: The Holy One said to him ‘since your name is the same as the name of My glory, I will give you my house as it is written “And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom…” (Melachim I 5:26) but it did not explain. Where did it explain? Elsewhere, where it is written “…for they saw that the wisdom of God (was) in him to do judgment.” (Melachim I 3:28) It is correct that these three ‘dwellings’ (shechinot) hint at the three Holy Temples. It is said of the First Temple “…dwell securely beside Him…” (Devarim 33:12) just as it says “…and the glory of the Lord filled the House.” (Divre HaYamim II 7:1) It says regarding the Second Temple “…He protects him all day long…” (Devarim 33:12) because the Presence of Gd did not rest there, but rather only covered and shielded that place. Or perhaps it means literally covering, as is mentioned in the Pirke Hechalot. “…and He dwells between his shoulders.\" (ibid.) This refers to the days of the Messiah, because “At that time, they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord…” (Yirmiyahu 3:17) This is how the verse is expounded in the Sifre.
