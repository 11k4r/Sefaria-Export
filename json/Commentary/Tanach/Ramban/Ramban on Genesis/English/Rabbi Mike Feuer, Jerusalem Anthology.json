                "… and it is already known that the four elements are one continuous solidity. Its unmoving base is the sphere of the land, the waters surrounds the land, the air surrounds the waters and the fire surrounds the air. The Torah describes the land taking form with the fire surrounding the mingled water and dust from above and the wind blowing and entering into the darkness and hovering over the waters. It appears to me that this point (which Gd created out of absolute nothing) in its taking on form and becoming bohu (in it there is) is what the Sages call “the foundation stone” (Yoma 54b) from which the world was founded…"

                "And Malchitzedek king of Shalem – This is Jerusalem as it says, “His Tabernacle was in Shalem…” (Tehillim 76:3) Andin the days of Yehoshua her king was also called “Adonitzedek” (Yehoshua 10:1) because from long ago the nations knew that site was the choicest of all places, located at the center of the settled world. Or they knew its value through received tradition, that it was aligned counter to the heavenly Temple where the Holy One’s Presence dwells, which is called “tzedek” (righteousness). In the midrash Bereshit Rabbah (43:6) is says this place makes its inhabitants righteous (matzdik) – Malchitzedek, Adonitzedek (Yehoshua 10:1). Jerusalem is called righteousness as it says, “…in which righteousness would lodge…” (Isaiah 1:21): It mentions that he is the priest of the Most High Gd to make it know that Avraham never would have given a tithe to a priest of other gods, but since he knew that Malchitzedek was the priest of the Most High Gd he gave him a tithe for the honor of HaShem. The hint to Avraham in this was that the House of Gd would be in that place and there his descendants would bring their tithes and offerings, and there they would bless the Lord. According to the opinion of our Sages who said (Nedarim 32b) that Malchitzedek was Shem the son of Noach, he left his land to go to Jerusalem in order to serve the Lord there. He became the priest of the Most High Gd for them because he was the honored brother of their father, as Jerusalem had always been within the lands of the Canaanites. Rashi wrote above (12:6) ‘and the Canaanites were then in the land’ – they were progressively conquering the land of Israel from the offspring of Shem, Avraham’s ancestor, because Jerusalem fell out in the portion of Shem when Noach divided up the land for his sons (Sifra 126) as it says, “And Malchitzedek the king of Shalem.” And this is not correct, because “And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon…” (Bereshot 10:19) which includes all of the land of Israel and the border of the sons of Shem was to the east of Masa far from the land of Israel. But, if Noach apportioned the land to his sons and gave the land of Israel to Shem this has the force of ‘one who distributes his possessions directly’ (see Mishna Baba Batra 9:7 and Rashi Gittin 14b). Therefore the children of Canaan settled there until HaShem bequeathed it to the seed of his beloved as I recalled above (10:15 )."
