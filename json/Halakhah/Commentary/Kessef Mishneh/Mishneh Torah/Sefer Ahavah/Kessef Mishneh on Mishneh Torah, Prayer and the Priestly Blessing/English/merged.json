It seems to me that he learned this from that which is stated in the teaching of R' Eliezer the son of R' Yose HaGlili, \"'You should fear the Lord your God and serve him': serve him with his torah, serve him with his temple.\" This is to say, pray facing him. And this is what our teacher wrote in his Sefer HaMitzvot.", 
                "In any place where he is.  There are two ways to explain this [phrase, 'where he is']. Either it refers to the people praying, that whether they are in the land of Israel or outside Israel, they should pray facing the Temple.  Or, it refers to the Temple, meaning in any place where the Temple is, whether it is in the desert, or in Gilgal, or in Shiloh, or Nov, or Giv'on, or whether the permanent structure has been built, we should pray facing the Temple in which people serve Hashem, may He be blessed, in any place where the Temple is, that is the direction in which we pray."
