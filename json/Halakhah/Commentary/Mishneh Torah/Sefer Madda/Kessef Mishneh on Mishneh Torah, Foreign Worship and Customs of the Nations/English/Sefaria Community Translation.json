                "Within this prohibition: At the end of the first chapter of Yevamot (13b), if you will ask how can Rambam decide like Abaye against Rava, perhaps you can answer that we only say (as a rule) that halacha is like Rava where they argue according to their own logic, but not where they argue about what someone else said or his logic.  See there.  And Rav David Cohen in a responsum has difficulty with the words of Our Rabbi (Rambam), because when there is in one city a difference of customs, where some have a certain custom and others have a different custom, this creates a situation of two courts.  But they are not truly two courts in every matter and instance.  And it is possible that for this reason he was exacting in his language.  He did not say that two courts in one city should not each practice its own custom, rather he wrote that there should not be two courts in one city, because once they each practice different customs, they are akin to two courts.  It is also possible that there is an error in the text, and it should read 'it should not be _like_ there are two courts', and copyists left out the 'like'."
