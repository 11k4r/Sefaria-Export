I shall explicate their methods and assess their worth. But if my thoughts cannot abide them, I shall humbly take issue with them, and judge as my eyes are given to see, with the clear legal vision given to me. I shall not show favoritism to received teaching. For God grants wisdom in all ages and days, and withholds not grace from those who walk in God's ways. "
