And therefore one should power-up like a lion to stand in the morning to serve Hashem, like you awaken the dawn. No matter what one shouldn't be late to the time of of prayers or the time of saying SHEMA ISRAEL. [The main strengthening  should be in the heart to, to overcome his will to win it, like a powerful man overpowers his hater and wins him and drops him to the earth. This is how one should fight is evil inclination, like a lion, get up from his sleep to server hashem ]. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 57). And never the less, that one who does a mitzvah, he should not be embarrassed from those who make fun of him, and anyway don't quarrel with them and fight the them, in order that he wouldn't get used to the trait of boldness which is very improper. And if his aim is to influence the eyes of the community in the matter of Torah or Mitzvot, and he tried already the way of peace but wasn't successful, then he is allowed to bolden himself to fight with them to defeat their wrong thoughts.",

And everybody who is able to wake up in the middle of the night, he should do it and say \"Tikkun Hasot\". And also, if you remain awake until the middle of the night, try not to sleep until you say Tikkun Hasot, to join with the pain of the Shekhinah in exile. However, when you pray and learn Torah you should be happy. And in any case, if you cry during the prayer, you prayer is accepted more."

A child who understands things should be taught from a young age to dress himself modestly. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 207)."

                "Any person who has a conflict with his fellow, should not permit himself to confidently maintain the justness of his position, because \"one does not see his own wrong\" (Shabbat 119a). Rather, he should put forth his claims with truth and simplicity before an established Rabbi, asking him to rule whether or not he is obligated to return money to his fellow. And even if his fellow is not bringing him to court, he is still obligated to fulfill his obligation towards heaven by asking a Torah scholar who is an expert decision-maker, as it is written (Mishna Avot Ch.1) \"Make for yourself a Rabbi and avoid doubt\". And even if his fellow does not know of the theft that was taken from him, one still has to return what was stolen and appease him. [Yalkut Yosef Moadim pg. 78. Chazon Ovadia on High Holidays pg.240]"
