                "The Torah States: \"You Shall cease activity\" -- Even From Things....  The Ramabam is saying that the Torah prohibits certain melachos, and the Rabanan discuss what they are and what their messures are. And still, a person would be able to toil in things that are not melachos the whole day. Therefore the Torah says \"tishbos.\" And so writes the Ramban in his explanation on the Torah, that the Chachamim assured many things. Alternatively, the Rambam is saying that there is an asmachta to everything that the Chachamim assur on Shabbos from \"tishbos.\" This is the explanation in the braisos in the the mechilta.\n"
