            "It is a positive commandment to pray every day, as it is written: \"You shall worship the Lord your God\" (Ex. 23:25).  By tradition, they learned that this worship is prayer, as it says: \"and to worship God with all of your heart\" (Deut. 11:13)—the sages said what is worship of the heart? This is prayer.  The number of prayers is not biblical, the form of prayer is not biblical, and prayer has no biblically fixed time.", 
            "Therefore, women and slaves are obligated in prayer because it is a positive commandment lacking a fixed time, but the obligation of this commandment is as follows: a person should supplicate and pray every day and relate the praise of God, and afterwards ask for their needs as a request and a supplication, and afterwards give praise and thanks to God for the good that has been bestowed upon them, each person according to their ability.", 
            "If one is accustomed/fluent, he increases in supplications and petitions, and if one has uncircumcised lips, he speaks according to his ability and anytime he likes. And so, the number of prayers is as each to their own abilities. There are some who pray once a day, and there are those who pray many times. And everyone would pray facing the Temple. And this was the way of things from the time of Moses to Ezra. ", 
            "When Israel was dispersed in the days of Nebudchadnezzar the evil, they were in foreign lands and they had children in the foreign lands and their children spoke babble. And everyone’s language was this one and this one and languages were very mixed. And since the speaker was not able to speak all, they needed one language, rather that they should be confused. As it is said: “And half their children spoke in the language of Ashdod, etc” [Nehemiah 13:24]. And none knew how to speak “Yehudit” and spoke the language of the people. And because of this, when one prayed, his tongue was shortened to ask for his needs, or to give praise to the HKBH in the holy language until that their tongues were mixed up. And when Ezra and his Beit Din saw this was, they rose and instituted for themselves the 18 blessings in the order of three first praises to HaShem, and three last thanksgivings, and the middle there were in them requests on all the things that are like the foundations of every person’s desires/needs, man to man. And the needs of the community should be set in the mouths of all and they will learn them. And there will be a prayer, even the stutterers will pray wholly like the prayers of the smooth talkers, because this matter was set, all the blessings and prayers were ordered in the mouths of all Israel so that the whole matter was set in the mouths of the stutterer. ", 
            "And so, they decreed that the number of prayers should be like the number of offerings: two prayers each day, corresponding to the two continual offerings. And for every day that has an additional offering, they decreed a third prayer, corresponding to the additional offering. And the prayer that corresponds to the morning continual offering is called \"the dawn prayer,\" the prayer that corresponds to the afternoon continual offering is called \"the gift prayer,\" and the prayer that corresponds to the additional offerings is called \"the additional offerings prayer.\"", 
            "And so, they decreed that a person pray one prayer at night, as the limbs of the afternoon continual offering would continue to be consumed all night. As it says (Leviticus 6:2), \"it is that which goeth up ...,\" along the lines of what it says (Psalms 55:18): \"Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan; And He hath heard my voice.\" But the evening prayer is not obligatory like the dawn and gift prayers, but even so, all of Israel, in all of their places of residence, are accustomed to pray the evening prayer, and they accepted it upon themselves like an obligatory prayer.", 
            "They also established a prayer after the afternoon prayer, just before sunset, only on the day of the fast [of Yom Kippur], in order to increase in pleading and supplication on account of the fast. This prayer is known as <i>Ne'ila</i> (\"closing\"), that is, [it refers to] the closing gates of Heaven as the sun sets, since it is only ever recited just before sunset. ", 
            "In conclusion, we now have three daily prayers, <i>Aravit, Shacharit and Mincha</i>, and on Shabbat and festivals we have four - the three daily prayers and the additional <i>Mussaf</i> prayer. On Yom Kippur we have five - the four aforementioned prayers and the concluding <i>Ne'ila</i>. ", 
            "One may not subtract from this [number of] prayers, but if one wishes, one may add to them. One can even pray all day long, if one so desires. These additional prayers are comparable to voluntary sacrifices [offered at the Temple], and one must therefore make an innovation in each of the middle blessings [of the Amidah], paraphrasing the [original] blessing. Even if one makes an innovation in a single blessing, this is sufficient to show that it is a voluntary prayer, rather than an obligatory one. Yet the first three and last three [blessings] are never added to or subtracted from, and nothing in them is to be changed. ", 
            "A voluntary prayer may not be recited by a community, just as the voluntary sacrifice was never a public one. Similarly, an individual may not pray the Mussaf prayer twice, once to fulfil his obligation and the other voluntarily, since the Mussaf sacrifice was not offered voluntarily. In addition, some of the Geonim ruled that additional prayers were not to be recited on Shabbat and festivals, since voluntary sacrifices were not offered on those days, but rather only the obligated offerings of that day.

            "Inner mindfulness: how does one attain it? Any prayer for which one is not fully mindful is not considered prayer.  And if one prays without mindfulness, one must go back and pray [again, this time] with mindfulness.  One who is confused or inwardly agitated is forbidden from praying until he settles himself; thus, one who has come in from traveling and is tired or unsettled is forbidden from praying until he settles himself.  The sages used to say that he ought to wait for three days until he has rested and his emotions have cooled, and only afterward may he pray.", 
            "How is intent (achieved)?  A person should turn his heart from all thoughts and envision himself as if he is standing before the presence of God.  Therefore he must sit a while before prayer in order to direct his heart and then he can pray with ease and supplications.  And he should not treat his prayer like one who is carrying a burden and throws it down and moves on.  Therefore he must sit a while after prayer and then take leave.  The early pious individuals would wait an hour before prayer and an hour after prayer and would draw out their prayer for an hour."

            "How must one dress [for prayer]? One begins by making himself smart and honourable, as it says \"Bow to the Eternal in honourable holiness\". One may not stand in prayer in his underwear, and not with a bare head, and not with bare feet - in such a place where one would not stand barefoot before nobility, and would wear shoes. One may not stand holding anything, not tools or money or even Tefillin or a Torah scroll, because they distract one's mind, except on Sukkot when one must hold the Lulav. If one was carrying a load on his head, and the time to pray came, if the load weighs less than 4 kavin it can be draped on one's shoulder, and if it is heavier it should be left on the ground during prayer. The custom of all sages and their disciples is to pray wrapped up.", 
            "Fix the place.  What does this mean?  One should stand in a low place and turn his face to the wall.  One needs to open windows or openings that face Jerusalem in order to prayer facing there, as it is written, \"And his windows were directed toward it in his upper chamber, etc. (Daniel 6:11).\"  One should fix a place for his regular prayer.  One should not pray in a ruin nor behind a synagogue, unless he turns his face toward the synagogue.  And it is forbidden to sit down next to someone praying the Amidah or to pass before him at a distance of less than four cubits.",

            "Bowing, how is it done? The one who is praying bows five bows in each and every prayer. In the first blessing at the beginning and at the end. And in “giving thanks” at the beginning and the end. And when he finishes the prayer, he bows and then takes three steps behind him to take his leave and he says goodbye. He turns his body to the left, and afterward he turns his body to the right, and afterward he raises his head from the bow. And when he bows \"4 bows\" he bows during the Barukh. And he  rises up during the recitation of the Name.  And to whom does all this apply? A layman. But a High Priest, bows at the beginning and at the end of all the blessings. And a king?  Once he bows at the begining, he does not raise his head until the end of his prayer.", 
            "And why do we start saying goodbye toward the left? Because his left side is the right side of Him whom stands before/in front of him. Namely, when he stands before The King, Giving Peace to the right of the King, and afterward to the left of The King. And it was determined that when he leaves from his praying, like leaving the presence of The King..", 
            "And all of the bows, these are done by bowing until your vertebrae separate until it is like a [rain]bow [or a bow as in “bow and arrow”].", 
            "Prostrating, how is it done? After he raises his head from bowing the fifth bow, he sits on the ground and falls upon his face to the ground for Tachanun and the entire Tachanun that he wants [to say]. The Bowing referred to everywhere is upon the knees, The Qeda bow is upon the nose.  Prostration is done with the hands and legs/feet stretched out until you find yourself placed upon the ground.", 
            "When you fall upon your face after prayer, some perform the Qeda bow. And some perform the prostration bow. It is forbidden to prostrate upon hewn stones outside of the Temple, as I have explained this in Laws of the Worship of the Stars.  And an important man should not fall his face upon the ground unless he is sure that he is as holy as Yehoshu'a. But instead he should lower his face but not place it on the ground. It is permitted for a person to pray in one location and to fall upon his face in another location.", 
            "The custom is straightforward in all of Israel (i.e. the entire Jewish people). That they do not fall on their face [or possibly \"That they do not offer Taḥanun (prayers of supplication)\"] during Sabbaths, Festivals, Rosh Hashanna, New Moons, Ḥanukkah or Purim. Nor during afternoon prayers leading up to Sabbath eves, nor afternoon prayers leading to the eves of Holy Days, nor for evening prayers on any day. However, there are those who do fall on their faces during evening prayers. [It is] only on the Day of Atonement that one falls on his face for all of the prayers since it is a day of supplications, requests, and fasts."

            "Someone who says in the appeals, \"He who had mercy on the nest of a bird, that one may not take the mother on the children, or that one may not slaughter [an animal] and its son on one day, He should have mercy on us,\" and the like, we silence him, for the commandments are decrees of the Scripture, and are not mercies. For if they were due to mercy, He would not have allowed us to slaughter at all. Similarly, he should not say many nicknames of  the Name, and say, \"The Powerful, the Great, the Mighty, and the Awesome, and the Strong, and the Brave, and the Staunch,\" for there is no power in a human to reach the end in his life. Rather, he should say what our Teacher, Moses, may he rest in peace, said."

            "It is not proper to read from chumashim in synagogues, in honor of the congregation. A Torah scroll should not be rolled [from one portion to another portion] in the presence of the congregation, because of the burden on the congregation, forcing them to remain standing while the Torah scroll is being rolled. Therefore, if it is necessary to read two separate portions, two Torah scrolls are taken out. [However,] one person should not read one portion from two Torah scrolls, lest people say that the first scroll was invalid and, therefore, they read from the second."
