            "1. When a person composes a bill of release for his slave and gives it to another person to acquire on the slave's behalf, saying: \"Take possession of this bill of release for so and so, my slave,\" the slave is granted his freedom even though the bill of release did not reach his hand. For it is possible to acquire something of benefit to a person outside his presence. If, however, a person said: \"Give this bill of release to my slave,\" he may not retract, but the slave does not attain his freedom until the bill of release reaches his hand. Therefore if a person says: \"Give this bill of release to my slave\" and dies, it should not be given to him after his master's death.",
            "2. When a person composes a legal document saying: \"I made my slave so and so a free man,\" \"My servant so and so was made a free man,\" or \"He is a free man,\" he is released. If, however, the document states: \"I will make him a free man,\" he is not released.",
            "3. When a master states that he released his slave and the slave denies being released, we suspect that the master had another person acquire the bill of release on behalf of the slave. If the master said: \"I composed a deed of release and gave it to the slave,\" and the slave says: \"You neither wrote it nor gave it to me,\" the statement of a principal is considered as equivalent to the testimony of 100 witnesses, and he is considered a slave until he is freed in the presence of witnesses.",
            "4. When a person commands at the time of his death: \"My heirs should not subjugate so and so, my maid-servant,\" she is still considered a maid-servant as before, but it is forbidden for his heir to subjugate her. For it is a mitzvah to fulfill the words of a deceased person. Similarly, if a dying man says: \"Generate satisfaction for so and so, my maid-servant,\" we compel the heirs not to make her perform any tasks other than the ones that she desires to perform. If he commanded them to free her, we compel them to free her.",
            "5. There are six matters in which a bill of release given to a servant is equivalent to a bill of divorce. With regard to other matters, a bill of release is equivalent to other legal documents. These are the six: a) they are not acceptable if prepared by gentile legal authorities; b) they are acceptable if one witness is a kuti, c) they must be written for the sake of the slave who is being freed; d) they may not be written on an article that is attached to the ground; e) the witnesses may sign only in the presence of each other; and f) the same laws apply to a bill of divorce and a bill of release with regard to bringing these legal documents from one place to another.",
            "6. What is implied? All legal documents that are composed by gentile legal authorities are acceptable provided they conform to all the conditions stated in Hilchot Halva'ah with the exception of bills of divorce for women and bills of release for slaves Any legal document that is signed by even one witness who is a kuti is not acceptable, with the exception of bills of divorce for women and bills of release for slaves, provided the kuti is known to be precise in his observance. In the present age, when the kutim are considered as gentiles with regard to all matters, we apply the laws stated with regard to them to the Sadducees. For the Sadducees in the present era are considered like the kutim of the previous era, before it was decreed that they would be considered like gentiles. With regard to a woman's bill of divorce, Deuteronomy 24:1 states: \"And he shall write to her,\" which is interpreted by our Sages to mean: \"for her sake.\" And with regard to a Canaanite maid servant's bill of release, Leviticus 19:2 states: \"Nor was freedom given to her,\" teaching that the bill of release must be written for her sake. With regard to a woman's bill of divorce, Ibid.:1,3 states: \"And he shall write, and he shall give,\" which is interpreted by our Sages to mean that the bill of divorce should be written on a substance that is lacking only to be given. This excludes a bill of divorce that is written while the article on which it is written is attached and afterwards detached. For it is lacking both being detached and being given. Similarly, with regard to a bill of release, it is written: \"given to her,\" teaching that the bill of release should be lacking only being given. Witnesses may not sign bills of divorce for women and bills of release for slaves outside each other's presence. We have already explained that reason for this ruling in Hilchot Gerushin.",
