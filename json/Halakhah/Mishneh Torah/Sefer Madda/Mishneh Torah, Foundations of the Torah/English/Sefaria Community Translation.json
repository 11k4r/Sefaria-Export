            "O princípio fundamental e base da sabedoria é: Saber que há um Ser Pré-existente primordial e este ser é quem causa a existência de tudo quanto há; de modo tal que, tudo o que existe - desde os céus à terra - não existiria senão por meio da realidade da existência deste Ser. ", 
            "E se supuserem que este ser não existe [isto significaria dizer] que todos as demais [formas] existentes não teriam como existir. ", 
            "E se supuserem que [a própria realidade é na verdade] inexistente; este Ser não seria afetado por isso. Pois tudo o que existe depende deste Ser para existir, mas -  este Ser - Bendito seja! - não depende nem sequer de um único [para sua existência].", 
            "Sobre isso declarou o Profeta: \"...e apenas HaShem, vosso Elokim é verdade.\" [Irmiahu 10:10] [quer dizer:] Este Ser é a verdade [absoluta, a própria realidade, e] não há outra concepção de verdade mais absoluta que esta. E sobre isso diz a Torá: \"Não há outro além Dele\" [Devarim 4:35] significando: Não há nenhum ser existente cuja existência seja real, como a realidade da Divindade...", 
            "Esse SER é o [que chamamos:] Elokim [Forças, Poderes] do Universo, [por isso consideramos este Ser como] Senhor [responsável, pela existência] de toda a terra. [E para ilustrar a atuação de Elokim na realidade:] Este ser é quem proporciona o movimento do planeta, [indicando tratar-se de] uma força infinita e incessante; uma força ilimitada, razão pela qual o planeta move-se sempre, sem que seja possível a existência do movimento sem que haja sua causa. Este Ser - Bendito seja! - é o causador [do fenômeno] sendo em Si: Incorpóreo.", 
            "[Além de óbvio] Reconhecer isto é um Mandamento positivo conforme está escrito: \"Eu sou HaShem, teu Elokim...\" [Shemot 20:2; Devarim 5:6.] Todo o que pensa haver outra divindade, fora este Ser, transgride um Mandamento negativo, como está escrito: \"Não terás outro Elokim diante de Mim!\" [Shemot 20:2; Devarim 5:6] Fazer isso é negar um princípio fundamental [da Torá] do qual tudo depende.", 
            "Esta Divindade é [essencialmente] Um. Ou seja, não [é essencialmente] dois ou mais que dois, senão: Um. Deste modo [quando], falamos da Unicidade deste Ser [estamos nos referindo a uma concepção] distinta das demais [formas de entender o termo. A Divindade não é um, de um modo que possamos comparar com algo físico também chamado de] \"Um\" dentre tudo o que existe no universo. [Ou seja, a Divindade] não é \"um\" [no sentido de uma] unidade que seja composta de diversas partes. Também não é \"um\" [no sentido de] um corpo [físico], que dispõe de divisões e de extremidades. O que estamos dizendo é que a unicidade da Divindade é inigualável [a qualquer outro conceito] de modo que não há [nada comparável, no] universo. [Deste modo concluímos que] caso houvessem várias divindades, elas seriam [obrigatoriamente] corpos ou matéria, pois [poderiam ser contadas, sendo compostas; e] tudo o que pode ser contado não pode ser distinguido [para tanto] a não ser pelas propriedades [físicas] sob as quais todos os corpos e a [própria] matéria é sujeita. Caso o Ser Criador, [fosse como] um corpo ou [como] matéria, seria finito e limitado, pois é impossível a existência de um corpo que seja [ao mesmo tempo físico e] ilimitado. E, tudo o que é [físico é] finito, tendo também sua força finita. Quanto a nosso Elokim, Bendito seja! - Seu poder não é finito nem pode ser limitado, pois o planeta movimenta-se continuamente [atestando para o fato de que], sua força não é corpórea. Não sendo Ele [como um] corpo, não se aplicam a este Ser os conceitos aplicáveis aos corpos [ou à matéria]. São estes conceitos materiais que nos permitem [compreender ideias de] divisão, separação, distinção. Portanto, é impossível que [a Divindade seja] outra coisa, a não ser Um. [Apesar de óbvio] Saber isto é um Mandamento positivo, como está escrito: \"..HaShem, nosso Elokim, é um! [Devarim 6:4]", 
            "Encontramos explicado na Torá e nos [livros dos] Profetas que Elokim é incorpóreo e imaterial, como está escrito: \"Pois HaShem, vosso Elokim, é o [único] Elokim nos céus e na Terra...\" [Devarim 4:39; Iehoshua 2:11] e um corpo não pode estar em dois lugares [ao mesmo tempo]. E, está escrito: \"Pois não vistes imagem alguma...\" [Devarim 4:15]. E, está escrito: \"Com quem então, vocês me compararão?\" [Ieshaiahu 40:25]. Caso [a Divindade] fosse um [ser] corpóreo, poderia ser comparado [de alguma forma] aos demais corpos.", 
            "Sendo assim, qual o significado do que foi registrado na Torá \"...sob Seus pés...\" (Shemot 24:10), \"escritos pelo dedo de Elokim...\" (Shemot 31:18; Devarim 9:10),\"...a mão de Elokim...\" (Shemot 24:1; Bamidbar 11:23; Devarim 2:15), \"...olhos de Elokim...\" (Devarim 11:12), \"...ouvidos de Elokim...\" (Bamidbar 11:1; Bamidbar 11:18) e muitos outros casos [assim]? - [estas expressões fazer parte do princípio de que] a Torá se expressa em linguagem comum - [e justamente porque a maioria] não tem senão uma [concepção] corpórea [das coisas], é que a Torá se expressa assim. [Portanto] todos [estes] termos são metáforas [aludindo a outros conceitos], tal como está escrito: \"se eu afiar minha espada flamejante...\" (Devarim 32:41) - E, por acaso Elokim tem [uma] espada para matar com ela? [Obviamente não!] - O sentido é que, [expressões assim são] metáforas [aludindo a outros conceitos]. [Reitero:] São metáforas! [E apresento mais uma] Comprovação disto: Um diz [numa visão profética] que as vestes de Elokim são como a branca neve (Daniel 7:9), e outro o vê como roupas rubras de Bosra (Ieshaiahu 63:1), enquanto que Moshe nosso Mestre mesmo teve a visão [profética sobre a Divindade, ilustrada] sobre o mar como um valente guerreiro, e [novamente] no Sinai [semelhante a] um Shalíach Tzibur (o enviado da comunidade =  o condutor das orações na Sinagoga) coberto com seu manto. [Todas estas variedades de experiências proféticas em visões ] Significam: Elokim não possui nem forma nem imagem, todos os elementos vistos fazem parte [da mensagem na] visão profética. Quanto a esta verdade [essência da realidade da Divindade]: não há capacidade intelectual no ser humano para alcançar ou investigar sobre ela [mesma]. Sobre isso afirma o versículo: Você poderia penetrar nas profundezas de Elohim? Pode descobrir os limites de Shadai?  [Ióv 11:7].", 
            "Qual o sentido então, do pedido de Moshe, nosso mestre? O quê [exatamente] ele buscava alcançar, quando disse: \"...Imploro-te que me mostres a tua Honra...\" [Shemot 33: 18] [O que ele] buscou adquirir foi [clareza no] conhecimento da essência da realidade da divindade, até [um nível tal] que [a compreensão da Divindade] ficasse [tão] marcado em seu íntimo, [que o Conhecimento da Divindade dele fosse] como o conhecimento [que se tem de] uma pessoa conhecida; [quando] a aparência dela fica gravada na memória. [Com este conhecimento ] se é capaz de distinguir tal pessoa [não confundindo-a com] as demais. Este é o modo pelo qual Moshe pediu que [o conhecimento da] realidade da Divindade ficasse em seu íntimo, [de modo tão claro e] distinto [que não houvesse confusão entre este conhecimento e o conhecimento] das demais [formas e possibilidades] existenciais. Até que pudesse compreender a realidade da Divindade como ela é. E o Bendito lhe informou porém, que não há no ser humano força [intelectual necessária] para alcançar a compreensão disto, de forma plena. Por outro lado, lhe concedeu algo que ninguém antes ou depois teve: O  alcance da compreensão da realidade da Divindade, no nível que [tornasse possível] distinguir [o conceito da Divindade] da [concepção existencial] de tudo o mais que existe. Então, assim como no conhecimento de alguém quando vê o [conhecido] pelas costas, [reconhecendo indiretamente] por suas proporções, vestes etc. A [este grau de conhecimento] se refere o verso:  ...e você verá minhas costas; meu rosto, porém, não deve ser visto. [Shemot 33:23]", 
            "Havendo ficado claro [neste ponto] que este SER não é nem corpóreo nem material, é óbvio que não se pode aplicar conceitos físicos e materiais a este ser: nem ligação ou separação, lugar ou proporção, subida ou descida; nem direita ou esquerda, nem adiante ou atras, nem [que está] sentado ou em pé. Este ser também não é temporal, tendo princípio ou fim, nem [se aplicam a este ser a] contagem de anos. Então, este SER não sofre transformação, pois não há nada que possa afetar este SER. Não se aplica a este SER o conceito de vida, nem o de morte; como fazemos com seres físicos. Não se aplica a este SER o Conceito de falta de conhecimento, nem o de sabedoria como fazemos com os Sábios. Nem sono, nem despertar, nem ira, nem riso, nem alegria, nem tristeza, nem silêncio, nem fala como se comunicam os seres humanos. E tudo isso já foi explicado pelos Sábios: \"Não existe acima [de nós] ninguém sentado, ou em pé, de costas ou de frente... ", 
            "Sendo assim, todas estas ocorrências [antropomórficas]  mencionadas na Torá e nas palavras dos profetas são todas parábolas e metáforas [aludindo a outros ensinamentos profundos] como: \"...O que está sentado nos céus se rirá,...\" [Tehilim 2:4] \"...provocaram-me com suas vaidades...!\" [Devarim 32:21] \"...Hashem sentia alegria...\" [Devarim 28:63] e etc. Em todos estes casos disseram os Sábios: \"a Torá fala na língua dos homens.\" E por este motivo lemos textos tais como: \"Por acaso vocês podem me irritar?\" [Irmiahu 7:19]. E, também: \"Eu sou Hashem - não sofro mudança!\" [Malachi 3:6]. Se a Divindade estivesse as vezes irado, outras alegre; então sofreria mudança. [Porém], todos estes exemplos [antropomórficos] apenas são verdadeiros nos corpos densos de natureza inferior; quer dizer, em seres materiais, cujas origens remontam ao pó. Quanto a este SER, Bendito seja! É muito elevado acima e além de tudo isto."

            "It is a mitzvah to love and fear this glorious and awesome God, as [Deuteronomy 6:5] states: \"And you shall love God, your Lord\" and, as [Deuteronomy 6:13] states: \"Fear God, your Lord.\"What is the path [to attain] love and fear of Him? When a person contemplates His wondrous and great deeds and creations and appreciates His infinite wisdom that surpasses all comparison, he will immediately love, praise, and glorify [Him], yearning with tremendous desire to know [God's] great name, as David stated: \"My soul thirsts for the Lord, for the living God\" [Psalms 42:3].", 
            "When he [continues] to reflect on these same matters, he will immediately recoil in awe and fear, appreciating how he is a tiny, lowly, and dark creature, standing with his flimsy, limited, wisdom before He who is of perfect knowledge, as David stated: \"When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers... [I wonder] what is man that You should recall Him\" [Psalms 8:4-5]. Based on these concepts, I will explain important principles regarding the deeds of the Master of the worlds to provide a foothold for a person of understanding to [develop] love for God, as our Sages said regarding love: \"In this manner, you will recognize He who spoke and [thus,] brought the world into being.", 
            "Everything which the Holy One, blessed be He, created within His world is divided into three categories. They include: a) Creations which are a combination of matter and form. They are constantly coming into existence and ceasing to exist; for example, the bodies of man and beasts, plants, and metals.b) Creations which are [also] a combination of matter and form, but do not change from body to body and from form to form as those in the first category. Rather, their form is permanently fixed in their matter, and they do not change as the others do; for example, the spheres and the stars [which revolve] in them. The matter [from which] they [are composed] differs from [a simple conception of] matter, and their form differs from [a simple conception of] form. c) Creations which have form, but no matter at all; for example, the angels, for the angels do not possess bodies or corporeal being, but rather are forms which are separate from each other.", 
            "What is meant by the prophets' statements that they saw an angel of fire or with wings? All these are prophetic visions and parables, as [Deuteronomy 4:24] states: \"God, your Lord, is consuming fire,\" though He is not fire and [the description of Him in this manner] is only metaphoric. Similarly, [Psalms 104:4] states: \"He makes His angels as winds....\"", 
            "Since they possess no body, what separates the form [of the angels] from each other? Their existence is not alike. Rather each one is below the level of the other and exists by virtue of its influence, [in a progression of levels,] one above the other.Everything exists by virtue of the influence of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His goodness. Solomon alluded to this [concept] in his wisdom, saying (Ecclesiastes 5:7): \"Because above the one who is high there is a watcher [and there are others higher than them].\"", 
            "The expression \"below the level of the other\" does not refer to height in a spatial sense as [one might say], he is sitting higher than his colleague, [but rather, in regard to spiritual level]. For example, when speaking about two sages, one of whom is greater than the other, we say, \"one is above the level of the other.\" Similarly, a cause is referred to as \"above\" the effect [it produces].", 
            "The different names with which the angels are called reflect their [spiritual] levels. Thus, they are called: 1) The holy chayyot, who are above all the others; 2) the ofanim; 7) the elohim; 3) the er'elim; 8) the sons of the elohim; 4) the chashmalim; 9) the keruvim; 5) the serafim; 10) the ishim. 6) the mal'achim; These ten names which are used to refer to the angels reflect their ten [different spiritual] levels. The level above which there is no higher level except that of God, blessed be He, is that of the form called chayyot. Therefore, the prophets state that they are below God's throne of glory. The tenth [and lowest] level is that of the form called ishim. They are the angels who communicate with the prophets and are perceived by them in prophetic visions. Therefore, they are called ishim, (“men”), because their level is close to the level of human knowledge.", 
            "All these [spiritual] forms are alive. They recognize and know the Creator with very immense knowledge, each of the forms according to its level and not according to its greatness. Even the highest level is unable to conceive of the true nature of the Creator as He [truly] is, since its intellectual capacity is too limited to know or to grasp [Him]. It does, however, comprehend and know more than the form which is below it. This is true regarding each and every level, including the tenth level. This [level] also knows the Creator in a manner that surpasses the potential to know and comprehend [God possessed by] human beings made up of body and soul. None [of these levels] can know the Creator as He knows Himself.", 
            "All existence, aside from the Creator - from the first form down to a small mosquito in the depths of the earth - came into being from the influence of His truth. Since He knows Himself and recognizes His greatness, beauty, and truth, He knows everything, and nothing is hidden from Him.", 
            "The Holy One, blessed be He, recognizes His truth and knows it as it is. He does not know with a knowledge which is external to Him in the way that we know, for ourselves and our knowledge are not one. Rather, the Creator, may He be blessed, He, His knowledge, and His life are one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Were He to live as life is [usually conceived], or know with a knowledge that is external from Him, there would be many gods, Him, His life, and His knowledge. The matter is not so. Rather, He is one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Thus, you could say, \"He is the Knower, He is the Subject of Knowledge, and He is the Knowledge itself.\" All is one. This matter is beyond the ability of our mouths to relate, [or our] ears to hear, nor is there [the capacity] within the heart of man to grasp it in its entirety. [In expression of this concept, Genesis 42:15] states: \"chay (By the life) of Pharaoh\" and [I Samuel 25:26] states \"chay, (By the life) of your soul,\" but [I Samuel, ibid.] does not say: \"chay, (By the life) of God\" but chai Adonai, “As God lives.” [This shows] that the Creator and His life are not two, as are the lives of living beings or the lives of the angels. Thus, He does not recognize and know the creations in terms of the creations as we know them, but rather He knows them in terms of Himself. Thus, since He knows Himself, He knows everything, for the existence of everything else is dependent on Him.", 
            "The concepts that we have mentioned about the subject matter in these two chapters are like a drop from the sea [when compared to] what is necessary to explain this matter. The explanation of all the fundamental principles of these two chapters is referred to as Ma'aseh Merkavah, (lit. “the work of [G-d’s] chariot.”)", 
            "The Sages of the early generations commanded that these matters should not be explained except to a single individual [at a time]. He should be a wise man, who can reach understanding with his [powers of] knowledge. In such an instance, he is given fundamental points, and an outline of the concepts is made known to him. He [is expected to continue to contemplate] until he reaches understanding with his powers of knowledge and knows the ultimate meaning and depth of the concept. These concepts are extremely deep, and not every [person has] the knowledge necessary to appreciate them. In his wisdom, Solomon described them with the metaphor [Proverbs 27:26]: \"Lambs for your clothing.\" [The root kevas \"lamb\" - also has the meaning \"hide.\"] Thus, our Sages interpreted this metaphor [to mean]: Matters which are the secrets of the world will be your clothing - i.e., they will be for you alone, and you should not discuss them in public. Concerning them, [Proverbs 5:17] teaches: \"They shall be for you and not for others with you.\" [Similarly, the Song of Songs 4:11] states: \"Honey and milk will be under your tongue.\" The Sages of the early generations interpreted this [as a metaphor]: Subjects that are like honey and milk should be [kept] under your tongue."

            "The spheres are that which are called \"sky,\" \"firmament,\" \"Zevul,\" and \"Aravot,\" and they are the nine spheres.  The sphere that is closest to us is the sphere of the moon.  The second that is above us is the sphere within which is the star called Mercury.  The third that is above us contains Venus.  The fourth sphere that is above us contains the sun.  The fifth sphere contains Mars, the sixth sphere contains Jupiter, the seventh sphere contains Saturn, and the eighth sphere contains all the other stars that appear in the firmament.  The ninth sphere is the one that rotates every day from east to west, and it surrounds and encircles everything.  All of the stars appear to be in one sphere even though one is above the other because the spheres are pure and transparent like glass and sapphire.  Therefore, the stars that are in the eight sphere appear to be below the first sphere.", 
            "Each of the eight spheres containing the stars are divided into many spheres, each one above the next like the layers of an onion. Some of them turns west to east and others from east to west like the ninth sphere which turns from east to west and there is no vacuum between them.", 
            "None of the spheres have mass or color, and this that we see them as \"sky blue\" is only a matter of appearance due to the height of the air. Similarly they have no taste nor smell since these qualities only exist in matter that is below them.", 
            "All of these spheres which surround the world are round like a ball and the earth is suspended in the middle. Some of the stars have smaller spheres which they are suspended in, but do not surround the earth. Rather these [smaller spheres] are suspended in a larger sphere which does surround [the earth].", 
            "The number of spheres which encompass the entire universe is eighteen and the number of smaller spheres which do not surround [the earth] is eight. From the movements of the stars and the knowledge of their revolution every day and every hour and from their tilts from north to south and south to north and their distance from the earth we know the number of all these spheres and their motions and how they circle each other and this is the science of calculating seasons and constellations and the Greek sages wrote many books on the subject."

            "The entire House of Israel is commanded concerning the sanctification of this great Name, as it is said, \"And I will be sanctified in the midst  of the children of Israel (Leviticus 22:32).\"  And they are warned  that they not desecrate it, as it is said, \"And you shall not desecrate My Holy Name (Leviticus 22:32).\"  In what manner?  When an idolater stands and coerces an Israelite to transgress one of the commandments that are stated in the Torah or be killed, he should transgress and not be killed, as it says, \"which a person will do them and live by them\" (Leviticus 18:5) - and live by them and not that he should die by them.  And if he died rather than transgress, behold [such a] one is obligated [to pay] with his soul.", 
            "When is this the case? With the other commandments besides idol worship, sexual immorality and murder. But with these three sins, if he says to him, \"Transgress one of them or be killed,\" he should be killed and not transgress. When is this the case?  At a time when the idolater intends it for his own pleasure; for example, if he forces him to build his house on Shabbat or to cook his meal or if he forces a woman to have intercourse, and similar to this. But if he intended it only to have him transgress the commandments, if [the Jew] were by himself and there are not ten [others] from Israel, he should transgress and not be killed. But if he forced him to have him transgress in the midst of ten of Israel, he should let himself  be killed and not transgress. And even if he only had the intention to have him transgress only one of all of the commandments.",

But at a time of [religious persecution] - and that is when an evil king, like Nevuchadnetsar and his colleagues, rises up and makes decrees against Israel to eliminate their religion or a commandment from [all of] the commandments - he should let himself  be killed and not transgress even one of all of the commandments; whether he is forced in the midst of ten or whether he is forced by himself among the idolaters.", 
            "Anyone about whom it is stated that he should transgress and not be killed and he [nonetheless] lets himself be killed and not transgress, behold [such a] one is obligated [to pay] with his soul. And anyone about whom it is stated, that he should let himself be killed and not transgress and is killed and did not transgress, behold [such a one] sanctified the Name. And if it was among ten of Israel, behold,  [such a] one sanctified the Name in public, like Daniel, Chananiah, Mishael and Azariah, and Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues. And these are the victims of the government of which there is no level above their level. And about them is it written (Psalms 44:23), \"Since for you are we killed all the day; we are considered like sheep of the slaughterer.\" And about them it is [also] stated (Psalms 50:5), \"Gather for Me all my pious ones, those have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.\" And all about whom it is stated, let him be killed and not transgress, and he [nonetheless] transgresses and does not let himself be killed, behold, [such a one] is desecrating the Name. And if it was among ten of Israel, behold, [such a one] has desecrated the Name in public. And [such a one] nullified a positive commandment, which is the commandment of sanctification of the Name; and he transgressed a negative commandment, which is desecration of the Name. And nonetheless, since he transgressed under duress, we do not give him lashes - and it is not necessary to say that the court does not put him to death, even if he killed under duress. As we only give lashes and put to death one who willfully transgresses with witnesses and a warning, as it is stated with someone who gives of his seed to Molekh (Leviticus 20:5), \"And I will (give) [set] My face to that man.\" And they learned from tradition that such a one is not under duress and not accidental and not through an error. And if [regarding] idol worship - which is more weighty than everything [else] - the worshipper under duress is not liable for excision, all the more so for the other commandments that are written in the Torah. And with sexual immorality, it states (Deuteronomy 22:26), \"And to the maiden, do not do a thing.\" But if he could spare his soul and escape from under the hand of the evildoer king and he does not, behold he is like a dog that returns to its vomit. And he is called one who worships idols willingly and he is expelled from [reaching] the world to come and he goes down to the lowest level of <i>Gehinnom</i>. ",

And if they specify  to them and say,  \"Give us x or we will kill all of you\" - if he was guilty of death like Sheva ben Bichri, they should give him to them, yet we do not instruct them so, ab initio; but if he is not guilty of death, they should all be killed and not give them one soul of Israel.", 
            "In the same way as they spoke about duress, so [too] did they speak about illness. How is this? One who became sick and is veering towards death and the physicians said to him that his cure is with a certain thing from the prohibitions of the Torah, we do [that prohibition]. And we heal ourselves with all the prohibitions of the Torah in a situation of [mortal] danger, except for idol worship, sexual immorality and murder - as with them, we do not heal ourselves even in a situation of danger. And if he transgressed and healed himself, the court punishes him with a punishment that befits him. ", 
            "And from where [do we know] that even in a situation of mortal danger, we do not transgress one of these three prohibitions? As it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:5), \"And you shall love the Lord, your God, with all of your heart, with all of your soul and with all of your resources\" - even if he takes your soul. And the killing of one soul of Israel for the healing of a different soul or to save a man from rape, is a thing that the mind leans to - that we do not destroy a soul for the sake of [another] soul. And sexual immorality is compared to [killing of] souls, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 22:26), \"as when a man rises against his neighbor and murders his soul, so is this thing.\" ",

A person who is filled with all of these traits [and] is complete in his body - when he enters 'the orchard' and is pulled into the distant great matters, and his mind will be correct to understand and comprehend, and he sanctifies himself and goes and separates himself from the ways of the rest of the people that go in temporal darkness, and goes and hastens himself and trains his soul not to have even a single thought about empty matters nor about the wastes of time and its machinations, but rather his thought is always directed towards the Heavens, tied under the Holy throne, to understand those pure and holy forms, and looks into the entire wisdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, from the primal form to the navel of the earth, and knows His greatness from them; immediately the Holy spirit rests upon him. And when the Divine spirit rests upon him, his soul will be integrated with the stage of the angels that are called <i>eeshim</i> (men) and he will change into a different man, and his mind will understand that he is not like he was, but rather that he has risen to a higher stage than other wise people, as it states with Shaul (I Samuel 10:6) \"and you will prophesy with them, and will have turned into another man.\"",

            "Moshe, our teacher, was not believed in by the Jews because of the signs he performed. For one who believes [in anything] because of signs has a doubt in his heart - since it is possible that a sign was done through trickery and magic. Rather, all the signs that Moshe did in the desert, he did out of necessity; not to bring a proof about his prophecy: It was necessary to drown the Egyptians, [so] he split the sea, and he made them sink in it. We needed sustenance, [so] he brought down the manna [from the sky] for us. They were thirsty, [so] he split the stone for them [and water came forth] for them. The congregation of Korach denied [Moshe's authority, so] the earth swallowed them. And so [too], all the other signs. And because of what did they believe in him? Because of the stand at Mount Sinai - that which our eyes saw and not a stranger's, that which our ears heard and not another's - the fire, the thunder, the lightning, and then [Moshe] approached the fog and the voice [of God] spoke to him and we heard \"Moshe, Moshe, go and say to them such and such.\" And so it states, (Deuteronomy 5:4) \"Face to face did God speak with you\"; and it states (Deuteronomy 5:3), \"The Lord did not make this covenant with our fathers.\" And from where [do we know] that the stand at Mount Sinai alone is the proof to [Moshe's] prophecy that it is true without a doubt? For it states (Exodus 19:9), \"Behold, I am coming to you in the thick cloud, in order that the nation will hear when I speak to you and also that they will believe in you forever.\" This implies that before this [event, the Jewish people] did not have a belief in [Moshe] that would stand forever, but rather it was a belief that [leaves] after it apprehension and [speculation].", 
            "What emerges is that [the Jewish people that Moshe] was sent to, were witnesses to his prophecy - that it was true. And [so] he did not need to perform another sign for them. For both he and they were witnesses to the matter; similar to two witnesses that see an occurrence together - that each one of them are witnesses that the other is speaking the truth and neither of them have to bring proof to his fellow. So was Moshe, our teacher; all of the Jewish people were witnesses to him after the revelation at Mount Sinai, and he did not need to perform a sign for them. This is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him at beginning of his prophecy, at the time [God] gave him the signs that he was to perform in Egypt: And He said (Exodus 3:18), \"And they will listen to your voice.\" Moshe, our teacher, knew that one who believes because of a sign has doubt and is apprehensive and suspects in his heart. And he [attempted to] evade going, saying (Exodus 4:1), \"And behold, they will not believe me,\" until the Holy One, blessed be He, informed him that these signs are only until the exodus from Egypt. And after they leave and stand at this mountain, the apprehension that they have about you will be removed; for I will give you a sign here that they will know that I truly sent you from the beginning, and there will not remain in their hearts any apprehension. This is what the verse [means] when it says (Exodus 3:12), \"and this will be for you a sign that I sent you, when you take out the nation from Egypt you will worship God on this mountain.\" The statement emerges that we do not believe every prophet that arose after Moshe, our teacher, solely because of the sign; so that it would be said, \"If he performs a sign then we will heed anything he says.\" Rather, it is because of the commandment that Moshe commanded in the Torah and said, \"If he gave a sign, 'to him you shall listen' (Deuteronomy 18:15).\" [This can be] compared to the commandment that we decide a case by the [testimony] of two witnesses, even though we do not know if they testified truly or falsely.

Rather, we saw with our eyes and heard with our ears like [Moshe] heard. What is this [false prophet] similar to? To witnesses that testify to a man concerning something that he saw with his own eyes, [but they claim to have] seen something different than what he saw. [And so] he does not heed them, but rather knows with certainty that these are false witnesses. Therefore, the Torah states that [even] if the signs and wonders come [true], \"You shall not heed the words of this prophet\" (Deuteronomy 13:4), as behold, this [false prophet] is coming with signs and wonders to contradict something that you have seen with your own eyes.

And so [too], did we learn from the early sages according to the tradition, that if a prophet tells you to transgress the words of the Torah about anything, like Eliyahu at Mount Carmel - listen to him, except for idolatry. And that is when the thing is temporary. For example, Eilyahu sacrificed a fire-offering outside [of the Temple], while Jerusalem was selected for this, and someone who sacrifices outside is liable for excision. But since he was a prophet, it is a commandment to listen to him - and also about this it states (Deuteronomy 18:15), \"you shall listen to him.\" And if they had asked Eliyahu and said to him, \"How is it that you uproot that which is written in the Torah (Deuteronomy 12:13), 'lest you bring up your fire-offering in every place'\"; he would say, \"It only states that one who sacrifices outside permanently is liable for excision as Moshe commanded, but I [only] sacrificed outside today, by the word of God in order to disavow the prophets of the Baal.\" And in this way, if all of the prophets were to command to transgress temporarily, it is a commandment to listen to them. But if they said that the thing [from the Torah] is uprooted forever, his death penalty is by strangulation, since the Torah stated (Deuteronomy 29:28), \"for us and for our children forever.\" ", 
            "And so [too], if he uprooted something from the things that we learned according to the tradition or if he said about one of the laws of the Torah that God commanded, that the law is like this and the [decision] is according to the words of x - behold he is a false prophet, since the Torah stated (Deuteronomy 30:12), \"It is not in the heavens.\" But [if it is] temporary, we listen to him about everything.

And even if he performed great signs and wonders and said that God commanded him that you worship idolatry only today or only this hour, behold this one 'has spoken that which turns you away about the Lord.' And about this, the verse commanded and stated (Deuteronomy 13:3-6), \"And the sign or the wonder comes true [...] Do not heed the words of that prophet [...], since he has spoken that which turns you away about the Lord, your God.\" As behold, he came to contradict the prophecy of Moshe, and therefore we know that he is certainly a false prophet and everything that he did, he did with trickery and magic - and [so] he is strangulated.

            "Words of adversity that a prophet speaks - for example, if he says that x will die or x year will be [one of] famine or war or similar to these things - if his words do not materialize, there is not a disavowal of his prophecy through this. And we do not say, behold he spoke and it did not come [true], since the Holy One, blessed be He is slow to anger and very kind, and He [may have] relented; or it is possible that [the ones slated for adversity] repented and He forgave them, like the people of Nineveh; or that He suspended it (temporarily), like with Hizkiyahu. But if he promises about the good and says that such and such will be, and the good that he says does not come [true], it is known that he is a false prophet - as anything good thing that God decrees, even on condition, does not [get repealed]. And we only find that He [repealed] a good thing with the destruction of the First [Temple], when He promised that the righteous ones would not die with the wicked and He [repealed] His words. And this is explained in Tractate Shabbat. Behold, you have learned that a prophet is only tested with words for the good - this is what Yirmiyahu said in his answer to Channaniah son of Azur, when Yirmiyah propesied for the bad and Channaniah for the good. He said to Channaniah, \"If my words don't stand, there is no proof in it that I am a false prophet, but if your words don't stand, it will be known that you are a false prophet,\" as it states (Jermiah 28:7-9), \"However, listen now to this thing, etc. The prophet that speaks peace, when the word of the prophet comes [true, it] will verify that he is a prophet that the Lord has truly sent.\" ", 
            "A prophet about which another prophet testifies that [the former] is a prophet - behold, he has the status of a prophet and this second one does not need investigation. As behold, Moshe, our teacher, testified about Yehoshua - and all of Israel believed in him, before he performed a sign. And so [too], for the generations. A prophet whose prophecy is known and whose words were believed time after time, or who a prophet testified about and he is going in the ways of prophecy - it is forbidden to [speculate] about it and to be apprehensive towards his prophecy, lest it not be true. And it is forbidden to test him more than needed. And we should not continually test him forever, as it states (Deuteronomy 6:16), \"You shall not test the Lord, your God, like you tested [Him] at Massah,\" since they [had then] said (Exodus 17:7), \"Is the Lord among us or is He not?\" Rather, since it is known that [such a] one is a prophet, they should believe and know that the Lord is among them, and not be apprehensive and [speculate] about him, as the matter that states (Ezekiel 2:5), \"and they will know that a prophet was among them.\""
