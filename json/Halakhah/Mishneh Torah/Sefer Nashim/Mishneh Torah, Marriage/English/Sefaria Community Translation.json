            "Before the giving of the Torah, it would be that if a man happened upon a woman in the marketplace and they wanted to marry each other, he would bring her into his house and consummate the marriage between them privately, and she would be his wife. Once the Torah was given, Israel was commanded that if a man wanted to marry a woman, he would acquire her first through witnesses, and afterwards she would be his wife, as it says, \"When a man takes a woman and comes (sleeps with) to her...\" (Deuteronomy 22:13).", 
            "And taking a wife as such is a positive commandment of the Torah. And a woman is acquired through three means: money, a contract, or through intercourse. Marriage through intercourse and by contract is from the Torah, and by money is Rabbinical [lit. \"the words of the Scribes\"]. And this acquisition is what is called \"Kiddushin\" or \"Eirusin\" in several places. And a woman who is acquired through one of these three means is called a \"Mekudeshet\" or \"Meureset\"."

            "How is a woman sanctified (for engagement)? If one choses to do so with money (or its equivalent), it can not have less than the value of a \"Peruta\". He says to her, \"Behold, you are sanctified to me\", \"Behold, you are engaged to me\", \"Behold, with this, you are to be my wife\", and he gives her the object in front of witnesses. The man must be the one to say words that have the meaning of an acquisition, and it must be he that is giving her the money. ", 
            "If she gives the money and says, \"I am sanctified to you\", \"I am engaged to you\", \"I am a wife to you\" or any other acquisition term, she is not sanctified. So too if she gives the money and he speaks, she is not sanctified. If he gives and she speaks, this is a questionable sanctification.", 
            "If he sanctified with a document, he writes it on  paper or clay or of earth, or on anything he desires. \"Behold, you are sanctified to me\", \"Behold, you are engaged to me\" and so on (other terms), and gives her the document in front of witnesses. "

            "Men are obligated in procreation (periyya u-reviyya), but not women.  When is a man obligated in this mitzva?  From the age of seventeen.  Once he reaches [the age of] twenty years and has not married, he has transgressed and neglected a positive commandment.  However, if he is involved in Torah and engrossed in it, and he fears that if he marries, he will have to busy himself with supporting a wife and thereby come to neglect Torah study, then it is permissible for him to delay [marriage]; for one who is involved in a mitzva is exempt from another mitzva – all the more so regarding Torah study.",

If it does, he is required to marry even if he already has children, in order that he not come to thoughts of sin.",

He should seem to her like a minister or king, walking in the desires of his heart, and distancing herself from what he hates.  This is how holy and pure Jews behave in their marriages.  These paths should be their pleasant and praiseworthy lifestyle. "
