            "Desire leads to coveting and coveting leads to robbery.  That if owners do not want to sell even if a great deal of money has been offered and pleading by friends, one is lead into robbery as it says, \"They coveted houses and stole them (Micah 2:2).\"  And if the owners stand against them to protect their property or prevent him from theft, he will be moved to shed bled.  Go and learn from the example of Achav and Navot."

            "... What is the case? When the tax collector is like a robber? When the tax collector is an idolater or the tax collector that is standing above him or the one sent by the king, and there is no limit, rather, he takes as much as he wants and gives [to the king] as much as he wants. But the tax established by the king, and is he said he should take a third or a fourth, or any amount with a limit. And [if] he appoints a Jew to collect this part for the king and it is known that this person is trustworthy, and he does not add anything over what the king has decreed, he is not under the assumption that he is a robber, since the law of the king is law. Not only that, but one who transgresses and smuggles from this tax is stealing from the king, whether the king is an idolater or a Jewish king.", 
            "...And so too a king who put a tax over the inhabitants of a city, or over each and every person, a predictable thing of every year; or over a field, something predictable. Or if he decreed that everyone who passes over this thing, all his possessions will be taken to the house of the king. Or that every person who is found in the field at the time of working the threshing floor will pay a tax whether he is or not the owner of the field - and all cases similar: this is not theft, and a Jew that is collecting those for the king is not under the assumption of being a thief, and he is a \"kosher\" person - provided that he does not add, nor change, nor get anything for himself.", 
            "", 
            "The general principle is: Any law that a king decrees to be universally applicable, and not merely applying to one person, is not considered robbery. But whenever he takes from one person alone in a manner that does not conform to a known law, but rather seizes the property from the person arbitrarily, it is considered to be robbery. Therefore, the king's dues collectors and his officers that sell fields with a defined tax on the fields, their sale is valid. But a personal tax is only collected from the person himself, and if they sold the field with a personal tax, behold this is not a valid sale unless the king has decreed that it is."

            "Whenever a person finds an article that appears to have been intentionally placed down, it is forbidden for him to touch it. This applies whether or not it has a mark by which it can be identified. The rationale is that perhaps the owner of the article left it there until he returns. Thus, if the finder takes it he will have ill-treated the owner. If the article does not have a mark by which it can be identified, he has purposefully caused his colleague financial loss, for the article does not have a mark that will enable it to be identified and returned. Even if it has a mark, he has wronged him, for he has troubled him to search for the article and identify it by its marks. Therefore, it is forbidden for the finder to touch it, unless it appears to have fallen. Even if the finder is in doubt and does not know whether the article was lost or placed down, he should not touch it. If he transgressed and took it, he is forbidden to return it to its place. If it is an article that does not have a mark by which it can be identified, the finder acquires it; he is not obligated to return it."
