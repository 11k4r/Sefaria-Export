Not a leader of the military, or a leader of 50 or a leader of 10.  Even to control the division of water to fields.  It goes without saying he cannot be a judge or a prince, who must be Jewish [by birth], as it says \"from amongst your brethren shall you put upon yourselves a king\".

And they do not use his scepter, his crown, or any of his instruments. And when he dies, all of them are burnt before him. And similarly one may not use his slaves or slave-women and servants, unless one is another king. Thus Avishag was permitted to Solomon and forbidden to Adonijah. ",

The wars of the seven nations, and the war of Amalek, and saving Israel from an enemy who comes against them. And after that, he may fight a discretionary war, which means a war fought against any other nation in order to widen Israel's boundaries and increase its greatness and reputation. ", 
            "An obligatory war does not require that he seek permission from the court, rather he may go forth on his own at any time and compel the people to go out, but for a discretionary war he may not bring forth the people except in accordance with the court of seventy one.",

In three places did the Torah prohibit [us] from not returning to Egypt, as it is stated: \"you shall not return upon this path again\" (Deuteronomy 17:16); \"you shall not continue to see it any more\" (Deuteronomy 28:68); \"you shall not continue to see them any more, forever\" (Exodus 14:13).

And we do not give lashes for this prohibition. As at the time of his entering, it was permissible; and if he thinks to settle and to tarry there, there is no act (as lashes are only administered if there is a forbidden act). And it appears to me that if a king of Israel conquers the land of Egypt in accordance with the court, that it is permissible; and [the Torah] only prohibited individuals from returning or dwelling there when it is in the hands of the gentiles, since their deeds are more corrupted than all of the lands, as it is stated (Leviticus 18:3), \"Like the doings of the land of Egypt.\" ",

And so [too] may he go out for merchandise. But to dwell outside the Land is prohibited unless there is intense famine, where the amount of wheat purchasable for one dinar becomes two dinars. To what does these words refer? When money is ample and produce is expensive. However, if produce is inexpensive and money is not ample, and there is not from what to earn [it] and coinage is gone from the pocket, he may go out to any place where he can find relief. And even though it is permissible to go out [in these circumstances], it is not the measure of piety; as behold, Machlon and Khilion were two leaders of the generation and they left because of great anguish, and [nonetheless] they became liable for destruction from the Omnipresent.

And so [too], one who is buried there is absolved, as if it were an altar of absolution, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 32:43), \"and His land will absolve its people.\" And as a punishment, it stated (Amos 7:17), \"upon impure ground you will die.\" And one's reception [by the land] while alive is not the same as one'reception after one's death (the latter being less significant). And nonetheless, the great sages would bring their dead there. Go and lean [this] from our father, Yakov and from Yosef  the righteous.",

As any one who goes out of the land is as if he worships idols, as it is stated (I Samuel 26:19), \"as they have driven me away from clinging to the inheritance of God, saying 'Go worship other gods.'\" And as a punishment, it stated (Ezekiel 13:9), \"and to the ground of Israel they will not come.\" The same way that it is forbidden to go from the land to outside of the land, so [too] is it forbidden to go out from Babylonia to the other lands, as it is stated (Jeremiah 27:22), \"To Babylonia will they be brought and there will they be.\""
