            "To rest on the seventh day of the week is a positive command, for it is written: \"On the seventh day you shall rest\" (Exodus 23:12). Anyone who works on it negates a positive command while transgressing a negative command, for it is written: \"You shall do no work\" (Exodus 20:10). What penalty does he deserve for doing work? If he did it voluntarily, willfully, he deserves <i>kareth;</i> if he acted in the presence of witnesses who forewarned him, he is stoned; if he acted unintentionally, he must bring a standard sin-offering.", 
            "In Sabbath laws, wherever it is stated that someone deserves punishment for doing something, he deserves <i>kareth;</i> if he acted despite the forewarning of witnesses, he deserves stoning; if he committed the transgression inadvertently, he has to bring a sin-offering.", 
            "Anywhere it says that a person who does such is \"exempt\", it means exempt from spiritual excommunication and from stoning and from the sin offering but it is forbidden to perfom such an act on shabbat. The prohibition is of rabbinic origin and meant to prevent (the transgression of forbidden) work. The one who does so anyway is flogged for rebelliousness. And anywhere it says \"don't do such and such\" or \"it is forbidden to do such and such on shabbat\" and a person does so anyway, that person is flogged for rebelliousness.", 
            "And anywhere it says that it is permitted to do such and such - one may do so from the outset. And also, anywhere it says that one \"is not obligated in any way\" or is \"exempt of all\" - that person is not flogged at all.", 
            "Whoever performs a forbidden labor on Shabbat, even though his intention is not for the labor itself, is liable for it. How so? If he extinguished a flame because he wants to conserve oil, or the wick so that it should not be finished or burn out, or so that the earthenware of the candle should not break. Extinguishing is a forbidden labor, and even if he doesn't need the extinguishing itself, and he only extinguished it for the oil or the earthenware or the wick, he is liable. So too one who transports a thorn four cubits in the public domain or extinguishes a coal so that people shouldn't be harmed is liable, even though he does not need the extinguishing itself or the transport itself, but he only does so to prevent harm, he is liable, and so too any similar case. ", 
            "But (on the contrary) if one performs an act which results in a forbidden labour and it is certain that this would be the outcome, even though the person did not intent (this outcome) he/she is liable because it is known that it is impossible not to have this forbidden labour to happen. How so? A person needs the head of a bird as a toy for a child and cuts off the head on shabbat. Even though the ultimate reason was not to slaughter the bird, the person is liable because it is obvious that it is impossible to cut off the head of a living creature and for that creature to survive, rather the bird's death was caused because of the action. And the same applies to similar cases.", 
            "Anyone who performs a (forbidden) labor - even if the person has no need for the actual labor - is liable for it. How  so? Someone extinguished a lamp in order (to save) the oil or the wick from being consumed or from burning or so that the earthenware lampholder would not break. Since the intention was to extinguish the lamp, although not for the purpose of extinguishing as such, but merely for the sake of the oil, the wick or the earthenware, the person is liable. Similarly, a person who moves a thorn four cubits in the public domain or extinguishes a coal so that many people will not be injured by it, is liable. Eventhough extinguishing (of the coal) or moving (ofthe thorn) as such is not important to the person, and the intent was merely to prevent injury, the person is liable. The same applies in other similar situations.", 
            "The one who intents to perform melakhah (forbidden labour) but does instead a different form of melakhah that the person didn't intend to do - the person is exempt from it because the person's intention was not carried out. How so? (The person) threw a stone or shot an arrow at someone or an animal in order to kill it and (the projectile) uprooted a tree instead without killing - that person is exempt. Kal vachomer (all the more so) if one intended to perform a lesser melakhah and instead performed a more serious one. For instance one intended to throw a stone within the  karmelit but it flew into the public domain. He is exempt. The same applies to similar cases. Someone intends to perform a permitted act and instead performs another (not permitted) such as, someone intended to cut produce already dissattached from the ground and cut instead produce that was still attached to the ground - the person is exempt from all. And the same applies to similar situations.", 
            "Someone who intended to pick black figs and picked white figs instead - or someone who intended to first pick figs and then to pick grapes, but instead picked grapes and then figs - is not liable. That persone indeed picked everything wanted, but because he/she did not pick them in the order intended, the person is not held liable, since the person did not act according to his/her intent. The Torah only prohibitted \"purposeful labor\".", 
            "A person had two candles before him and both of them were either burning or extinguished, and he/she desired to kindle or extinguish one, but instead kindled or extinguished the other, that person is liable, for performing the (forbidden) labor originally intended to perform. To what can that be compared? To a person who intended to pick one fig and picked another instead, or to a person who desired to kill one (creature) and killed another instead, because the intended forbidden labour was performed.", 
            "But if the person intended to kindle the first and to extinguish the second candle afterwards but the order was reversed, and instead, extinguished (one) candle first and kindled the second candle afterwards - the person is exempt. If the person extinguished one and kindled the other in a single breath, the person is liable. Although the person did not kindle the first candle before (extinguishing the other), he did not delay (the action), and performed both activities simultaneously and is therefore liable. The same applies in similar cases. Whenever someone performs a melachah casually, without specific intention, the person is not liable.", 
            "Anyone who intended to perform a melacha and performed it more effectively than originally intended, is liable. If [performed] less effectively than originally intended, not liable. How so? A person intended to carry a load suspended behind him and instead, it swung in front of him. He is liable, for his intention was to protect it (the load) in a less effective way, but ultimately it was protected in a more effective way. But, if he intended to carry a load suspended before him, and instead it swung behind him, he is not liable, for his intention was to protect it in a more effective way and, it was ultimately protected in a less effective way.", 
            "", 
            "Any person who wants to perform melacha on the Shabbat, and began doing so, if he performed a shiur (an amount of work sufficient to incur liability), he is held liable, even if he did not complete the work he desired to perform. How so? A person desired to write a letter or a document on the Shabbat. We do not say that he is not liable until he completes what he intended to do and writes the entire letter or document. Rather, as soon as the person is liable as soon as he writes two letters. Likewise, a person who desires to weave an entire garment is considered liable after weaving two strands. Eventhough he intended to complete (the whole garment), he is considered liable on account that he  intentionally performed a shiur. The same applies in similar cases.", 
            "Any labor that one can do alone, and two did it together, whether they each did part of it, for instance: one lifted up the object from a domain, and the second put it down in another domain, or the two of them did it as one from beginning until the end, for instance: they both held the same quill and wrote, or held a loaf together and moved it, they are exempt from punishment.", 
            "And if a single individual cannot perform (the melacha) alone and must be joined by others, such as, two people held a beam and transferred it to the public domain. Since neither one of them had the strength to do this alone and they did it together from the beginning to the end, they are both held liable. The shiur (for liability) is the same for one as for both. One of them had the strength to transfer the beam alone, and the other was not capable to transfer it alone: They join and transfer the beam: the one who is capable is held liable. The second one is considered as offering assistance. A person who (merely) offers assistance is not liable at all. The same applies in other similar cases.", 
            "Anyone who destroys, is not held liable. How so? A person who injures another person or an animal with a destructive purpose, or someone who rips or burns garments, or someone who breaks utensils with a destructive purpose is not held liable. Someone who dug a hole only because he needed the dirt is considered as somone who destroys, and is therefore exempt, eventhough he performed a melacha, he is not held liable because the intention was to destroy.", 
            "Someone who destroys with the purpose of constructing is liable. How so? A person who demolishes (e.g. a building) in order to build (another) in its place, someone who erased for the sake of writing in the place where he erased, or one who dug a hole in order to build a Foundation(for a structure) within, and all similar cases, is liable. The shiur for this is the same as the shiur for creating. ", 
            "Anyone who performs melacha on the Sabbath, in part with intent and in part unintentionally, regardless that he began intentionally but finished unintentionally, or that he began unintentionally but finished intentionally, is not liable. Until he performed the shiur of melacha in its from the beginning to the end intentionally - then he is liable of karet (spiritual excommunication). And if there were witnesses who warned the person, he would be liable to be exectued by stoning. And if someone does a shiur of melacha unintentionally from beginning to end, such a person would be liable to bring a fixed sin offering.  "

            "Like all other precepts, the Sabbath is set aside where human life is in danger. For a person who is dangerously ill everything may be done on the Sabbath at the bidding of a local competent physician.— —", 
            "If it has been estimated on the Sabbath that the patient will require a certain treatment for eight days, we must not say: \"Let us wait till evening, so as not to desecrate two Sabbaths.\" We should rather begin the treatment from that Sabbath day, and desecrate even a hundred Sabbaths for his sake. As long as he needs treatment in the presence of danger or possible danger, we should desecrate the Sabbath for his sake by lighting or extinguishing a lamp, by slaughtering, baking, cooking, heating water for drinking or bathing. The gist of it all is: in consideration of a person who is seriously ill, the Sabbath is like a weekday regarding every thing he needs.", 
            "These things should not be performed by non-Jews, minors, servants or women, lest they consider the Sabbath a light matter; instead, scholars and sages of Israel are to carry them out. One must not put off the desecration of the Sabbath in treating a serious patient, as it is written: \"If a man obeys them he shall live by them\" (Leviticus 18:5), but he must not die by them. From this you may infer that the laws of the Torah are not meant to wreak vengeance upon the world, but to bestow on it mercy, kindliness, and peace.— —", 
            "If one feels pain in his eyes, being inflamed or affected by some disease, and pus, tears or blood flow from them, he is considered seriously ill, and we may break the Sabbath in preparing whatever cure he needs.", 
            "And so too if he is injured in his body cavity-- from his lips and inward, whether in his mouth or his digestive tract or his liver and spleen, or in other in any other places in his cavity-- this is a dangerously ill person and there is no need to assess if his illness is heavy enough. Therefore, we desecrate the Sabbath for him immediately without assessing [its severity]. An injury on the back of the hand or back of the foot is like an injury of the body cavity and there is no need to assess [its severity], and we desecrate the Sabbath for it. A fever that prickles the skin [causes shivering?] is similar an injury to his body cavity and we desecrate the Sabbath for him. And so to for all illnesses that the doctors say is dangerous, even if it is only outside on the skin, we desecrate the Sabbath by their word.", 
            "If someone swallows a leech, we can warm water for him on shabbat and do anything necessary for his healing since he is in mortal danger. And so to someone who is bitten by a rabid dog or by any animal that crawls in the dirt that [is poisonous and] can kill you, even if there is a doubt whether it is poisonous or not, we do anything medically necessary to save him.", 
            "A sick person whose doctors assessed that a fig needed to be brought to him, and ten people ran and brought him ten figs at once, they are all completely absolved [of punishment]. [This applies] even if they brought them one after another, and even if he got better after the first [fig], since they all brought them with permission.", 
            "If a sick person needed two figs, and they only found two figs on two separate branches and three figs on  one branch, we cut the branch that has three even though we only need two in order to not increase the amount of harvesting. Rather, we only cut one and do not cut two; and so too with other similar situations.", 
            "If someone cooks for a sick person on the Sabbath, and the sick person eats, and there are leftovers, it is prohibited for the healthy person to the leftovers because of a decree lest he increase for himself the amount he cooks. But if someone slaughters for a sick person on the Sabbath, it is permitted for the healthy person to eat the raw meat from it since there is no additional action upon which a decree could be made \"lest he increase for himself.\" And so on.", 
            "A sick person who is not in danger, you can do anything he needs through a non-Jew. How is this done? Tell the non-Jew to do for him and he can do it, to cook or to bake or to carry medicine from one domain to another, and so on. And so to he can powder his eyes [for comfort] through the non-Jew on the Sabbath, even though there is no danger. And if there are any non-work actions that need to be done, even a Jew can do them. Therefore we can raise his ears on the Sabbath and raise the cartilage [of his heart], and we can reduce a fracture, and anything along these lines is permitted.", 
            "A pregnant woman who is squatting to give birth is in mortal danger and we violate the Sabbath for her. We call a midwife for her from one place to another and we cut and tie the umbilical cord, and if she needs a candle at the time of her labor pains we can light a candle. And [this is true] even if she is blind, since her mind will be calmed by the candle even if she can't see. And if she needs oil or anything else, we can bring it for her. And anything that can be changed [about the Sabbath violation being performed] should be changed when being done. For example, her friend should bring her utensil tied to her hair; but if she can't, she should bring it as normal.", 
            "We don't birth an idolatress on the Sabbath, even for a fee, and we don't worry about creating bad relations [between the Jews and non-Jews], even if there is no violation [of the Sabbath]. But we birth a non-Jew in your midst [i.e. a non-Jew who does not worship idols], since we are commanded to sustain them, and we don't violate the Sabbath for her.", 
            "A woman in childbirth, from the time the blood starts to flow until the birth, and three days afterwards, one desecrates the shabbat for her and does all that she needs. Both if she says \"I need this\" or if she says \"I don't need this\". And after three days up until a seven days, if she says \"I don't need this\" - one does not desecrate shabbat for her. But if she is silent, and it goes without saying if she says \"I need this\"- one desecrates the shabbat for her. And after seven days until 30 days she is considered like a sick person not in immediate danger and even if she says \"I need this\" - one does not perform melacha (forbidden labour) for her but (be performed) through a non-Jew.", 
            "A fire may be kindled for a woman in childbirth even during the summer because the chill is hard for a woman in childbirth to tolerate in the colder regions. But a fire may not be kindled for other sick for them to warm themselves. But someone who has lost blood and becomes cold one may kindle a fire for him even in the time of Tammuz (the summer). One may wash a newborn baby on shabbat on the day he/she was born after the umbilical cord is cut even if the water needs to be heated on Shabbat. And herbal powder can be applied and his limbs be tied because of the danger to him if not doing so. And likewise he may be washed before circumcision, after circumcision and on the third day after circumcision in warm water that was heated on shabbat because of the danger (of not doing so).",

It is rather a duty, binding on men and women alike; they are obligated to have lamps burning in their homes on Sabbath eve.

Since one is at leisure and at home, he might look about for something to do; the result would be that he would not rest at all, thus disregarding what is written in the Torah, \"that they may rest…\" (Exodus 23:12)."
