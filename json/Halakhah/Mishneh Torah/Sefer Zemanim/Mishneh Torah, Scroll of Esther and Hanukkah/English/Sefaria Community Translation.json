He should drink wine until he becomes intoxicated and falls asleep in his intoxication. And similarly a a person is obligated to send two portions of meat or two types of cooked food or two types of food to his friend, as it says (Esther 9:22) \"and send portions one man to another\" two portions to one man. And all that increase to send to others is praiseworthy.

One should give no less than two poor people one gift each of money or types of cooked dishes or types of food, as it says (Esther 9:22) \"gifts to the poor\": two gifts to to poor people. And one should not be particular about Purim money, rather give to every person who puts out his hand. And one should not change Purim money for another charity.", 
            "It is good for people to increase in their gifts to the poor more than they increase in their meal and the gifts that they send to their companions, for there is no greater or more glorious joy than to bring happiness to the hearts of the poor and orphans and widows and strangers, for he who brings happiness to the hearts of these unfortunate people is compared to the Divine Presence, as it says, \"To revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones\" (Isaiah 57:15).",

Even though all memory of our suffering will be erased…still the days of Purim will not be annulled."

            "How many lights do you kindle on Chanukah?  It is a commandment that one light be kindled in each and every house whether it be a household with many people or a house with a single person.  To exalt the mitzvah, one may kindle light according to the number of people in the household, a light for each and every person, whether they are men or women.  One who wishes to further glorify this and performs the mitzvah in the most choice manner kindles a light for each person on the first night and adds on following nights one light.", 
            "How does this work? Suppose the people of the house were ten. On the first night, one lights ten candles; on the second night, twenty; and on the third night, thirty; until the result is that one lights on the eighth nigh eighty candles. ",

[If] he forgot or intentionally did not light with the setting of the sun, he can light until pedestrians leave the marketplace. And how long is this time? Like a half hour or more. If this time passes, he [may] not light. And he needs to put enough oil in the candle so that it will continue to be lit until the pedestrians leave the marketplace. If he lit it and it became extinguished it, he is not required to light it another time. If it stayed lit after the pedestrians leave the marketplace, he can extinguish it or take it away, if he wants.  ",

Even if one does not have anything to eat except from charity, he borrows, or he sells his clothes and gets oil and candles and lights.",

One gives preference to Hanukkah candles, as they have an additional component of recalling the miracle.",

Great is the peace for all of the Torah was given in order to make peace in the world as it says; her ways are the ways of pleasantness and all her paths are that of peace. "
