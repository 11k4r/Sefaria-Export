                    "And so we find that the sages said about Avraham our Father, who worried about getting out of Haran and abandon his father Terach on his old age, and God said to him \"Go forth from your native land and from your father’s house to the land that I will show you\" (Gen. 12:1), and [God] exempted him with this from the mitzvot related to honoring parents (Bereshit Rabbah 39:8). And so our sages said that Yaakov our Father was punished through his son Yosef abandoning him for 22 years, because he himself abandoned his parents and went to Haran for 22 years. And even though Yaakov was compelled to flee his brother, who wanted to kill him, and did this because his parents commanded him to; due to the fact that nevertheless he did not honor his parents during that many years, and also due to the fact that he did not return quickly when he was able to, he was punished. Despite all this, for the needs of studying Torah a person can leave their parents: we find that Yaakov our Father went to the house of study of Shem and Ever, and learned there for 14 years, and was not punished for that (see Megilah 17a)."

                    "(1) Honoring Parents / Regarding one whose parents have dementia",
                    "(2) One of the saddest questions regarding honoring parents is what should one behave towards parents whose awareness has been taken from them?",
                    "(3) Answer: Even if the parents do not have awareness anymore, one should never disgrace them,and one should always try to behave towards them with honor and love according to their ability, until heavens have pity on them. And if the parents loose their minds completely to the point that the child cannot see them in that state, and whenever they see each other the child gets to a state of anger and fighting, if it is possible for the parent to be left in another place and be taken care properly by others, this is preferable.",
                    "(4) An example is brought in the Talmud (Kiddushin 31b): Rabbi Asi had an old mother who became senile. She asked for jewellery, and he bought it for her. After some time she wanted to marry, and entreated him that he should find a match for her. And even though he could not find a groom for such elderly and senile woman, Rabbi Asi would always answer that he would make an effort to find one. However, when she began demanding that he should find a groom that was exactly like him, young, kasher and handsome, Rabbi Asi could not stand to see her like this, and left the place where she lived.",
                    "(5) And this is provided that the parents can take care of themselves. Meaning, they can feed and clothe themselves, and do all their needs to proper exist, and only their awareness is diminished, and whenever they see their child they make strange requests and the child can't stand seeing them like this. However, when parents are so weakened, whether in body or in mind, that they cannot take care of themselves, it is forbidden to abandon them. Rather, if the child has money enough, the child should pay another person to take care of the parents, or make arrangements in for a nursing home. And if a nursing home won't take them, and if the child has no financial ability to pay a caregiver, the child should give care to their parents, and through maximal efforts to behave towards them with patience and pleasantness. (Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 240:10; Taz on the Shulchan Aruch 240:14; Aruch HaShulchan, Yoreh De'ah 240:32)."

                    "(1) Honoring Parents /Attitudes of parents towards children, no hitting",
                    "(2) Even though the mitzvah of honoring parents is very important, the Shulchan Aruch wrote (Yoreh De'ah 240:19): \"It is forbidden [for the parent] to make their yoke heavy upon their children and to be exacting with them about their honor, so as not create a hindrance for the children. Rather the parent should forgive and avert their eyes from them; since a parent who foregoes their honor, their honor is forgiven.\"",
                    "(3) Maybe from the side of judgment the parents could demand more honor from their children, but this will not help. No positive result comes from this, parents that always complain that their children do not honor them enough. On the contrary, children love to honor their parents willingly from love, and not from being forced. Thoughtfulness towards children's honor and needs is what contributes for children honoring their parents in great measure.",
                    "(4) Aside from that, a parent who forgoes their honor has their honor forgiven. That is to say, in the instance that parents concede that the child shouldn't devote themselves to the honor of the parents, the child is exempt. It is understood that when the parents concede, if the child honors them the child fulfills the mitzvah, but if the child does not, the child has not transgressed. And are there parents who would want their children to be punished because of the sin of not honoring the parents?!",
                    "(5) The most successful way to educate children to honor their parents is when they see a personal example, how do the parents honor their own parents. And someone who is negligent with their parents while they are still alive should not be surprised when their own children do not honor them; and when they need help, that the children do not help them - they learned this from the parents.",
                    "(6) In the past, in the case of a parent who hit their grown children, even if the parent's actions were completely righteous, the beit din would punish and ostracize the parent, since the parent transgressed the prohibition of \"do not put a stumbling block in front of the blind\" (Leviticus 19:14), since obviously the child will be angry and bear a grudge, and even return a double portion (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 240:20, see above 1:3 and 1:16 regarding the seriousness of not hitting parents).",
                    "(7) Even though in the past good parents would educate their children also with physical punishments, and even though it is written \"He who spares the rod hates his son\" (Proverbs 13:24), and even though the sages said \"one who holds back from hitting their children, at the end [the children] will go to a bad culture and the parent will hate them\" (Shemot Rabbah 1:1) nowadays one should be sparing in physical punishment."

                    "(1) Honoring parents / Evil parents",
                    "(2) Question: Does the mitzvah of honoring parents apply to parents who are evil, who transgress constantly, or maybe there is the case of parents who destroyed their virtues so much that the children are exempt from honoring them?",
                    "(3) Answer: The halachic decisors have been divided in this question. (SA 240:18) According to the author of the Shulchan Aruch, Rabbi Yosef Karo, even if the parent is a transgressor the child is still obligated to honor and fear the parent. Not only that, even if the child is a mamzer, meaning, the parent conceived the child by transgressing the prohibition against adultery, and through this rendered the child defective, making it impossible for the child to ever marry a Jewish person,  even in this case the child is obligated to honor their evil parent, meaning, to honor and support the parent in times of old age, when the parent needs help.",
                    "(4) On the other hand, according to Rabbi Moshe Isserles, (the Ram\"a), who authored the glosses on the Shulchan Aruch, there is no mitzvah for a child to honor their evil parent, since all the mitzvot of the Torah regarding honoring parents apply to regular parents, who are not evil, but the Torah would not command someone to honor evil people. And one should make clear that the evil parent spoken of is a person who clings to evil actions and sins aplenty, hurts and insults intentionally other people, or transgresses just to cause others to anger. But regular people, who sometimes stumble and sin, it is clear that the mitzvah of honoring and fearing them applies. And even in the case where everyone sees and understands that the parent is evil, and according to the Ram\"a there is no mitzvah of honoring and fearing such a person, it is forbidden for the child to insult the parent or cause any harm.",
                    "(5) Every so often those who return [ba'alei teshuvah] make the mistake to think that they do not owe their parents any honor, given that their parents are secular. However the halakha is, in our times, that every person that behaves properly and decently, even if they do not observe mitzvot, is not considered evil, and obviously the mitzvah of honoring and fearing them applies. And this is because in our times, most people who do not observe mitzvot don't do this out of spite, but due to the general atmosphere of the generation. Therefore, a ba'al teshuvah is obligated in honoring their parents, even though the parents are not observant."

                    "(1) Honoring parents / Abusive parents",
                    "(2) There is the need, indeed, to distinguish between parents who are prone to loose their understanding and give in to anger, raising their children in an uncompromising rigid fashion, and yet whose basic intent is positive and between those who are cruel and behave in a sadistic form towards their children. To the first group, honoring and judging giving the benefit of doubt is due. However, sadistic behavior endangers body and soul, and therefore it is imperative to stop it. And we need to support and strengthen the child that suffers sadistic abuse, and make clear that this suffering has nothing to do with the child being guilty of anything. All the more so when we are speaking of sexual abuse. It is clear that we need to rescue such children from such expected dangers. (And it is important to be aware that there is also need to differentiate between disgusting and ugly behavior and sexual abuse, and there are those who err on this and create difficult problems.)",
                    "(3) Indeed, even in such a terrifying and complicated reality, one needs to find a way to give the evil parent the benefit of doubt, and explain to the child that the behaviors that the parent engages in are forbidden from the outset, and one should never ever repeat them, and yet that the parent seems to suffer from a condition or illness, whether physical or spiritual, and so the parent sinned. The more the child can understand that the parent that abused them is sick, the more the child will be able to make sense of the moments of kindness that the parent engaged as if the parent was a regular parent. The child will be able to remember fondly those moments, and they might form the basis of the child's strength for forming good and healthy bonds with their own future children."

                    "The first personal mitzvah given to the first Jewish person was the mitzvah of circumcision. However, according to all [other opinions] it was the mitzvah of going up to the land [of Israel], as it is said \"Ad-nai said to Abram, 'Go forth from your native land and from your father’s house to the land that I will show you.'\"However, the mitzvah of settling the land is a collective mitzvah, that encompasses all those living in the Jewish people in general, and the life of every Jewish individual in particular, but as a personal mitzvah the circumcision is the first mitzvah. There is a connection between the mitzvah of settling in the land and circumcision, since through those two mitzvot holiness reveals itself both in body and in physicality. Through settling in the land it becomes clear that there is value in every act of work that is connected to the building of the land, and through the brit milah it becomes clear that there is holy value to the body, therefore the orlah needs to be separated from it."
