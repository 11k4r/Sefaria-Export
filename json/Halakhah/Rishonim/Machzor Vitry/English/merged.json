                "The story is told of Rabbi Akiva who was walking in a cemetery and came across a naked man who was dark as coal and carrying a huge load of sticks on his head. Thinking that he was alive, Rabbi Akiva asked how he had gotten into the situation of needing to do such difficult work, and offering to go to any means necessary to redeem him. The man asked Rabbi Akiva to get out of his way. \"What's the story here\", asked Rabbi Akiva. \"I'm actually dead\", the man replied, \"and every day they send me to cut down trees.\" \"What was your job when you were alive\", Rabbi Akiva asked. \"I was a tax collector\", the man replied, \"and I would favor the wealthy and kill the poor.\" Rabbi Akiva asked him, \"“Haven’t you heard anything from those appointed to punish you about how you might be relieved?” “I did hear from [those appointed over me] one impossible thing\", he replied. \"They told me the only way to get out of this situation is if I had a son who stood up in the minyan and declared \"Barchu et Hashem Hamevorach\", and they answer after him, \"Yehei Shmei Rabah Mevorach\". If that were to happen, I would immediately be released from this punishment. I didn't have a son, but I left behind a pregnant wife. I don't know if she gave birth to a son. If she did give birth to a son, who would possibly teach this son Torah, since nobody in the world liked me?\" Immediately, Rabbi Akiva decided that he would go search and see if the man did in fact have a son who he could teach Torah and teach to lead prayers.\" Rabbi Akiva asked the man who was being punished, \"What's your name?\", and the man answered, \"Akiva\". He asked him, \"What's your wife's name?\", and he answered \"Shoshbina\". He asked \"Where are you from?\", and the man responded, \"Ludkia.\" Immediately Rabbi Akiva put himself through great difficulty to find the man's family. When he made it to the town, he asked about the man. \"May that man's bones erode\", the people responded. He asked about the man's wife. \"May her memory be wiped out for all time\", they said. He asked about the child. They responded, \"He isn't even circumcised\". Rabbi Akiva immediately circumcised the boy. Rabbi Akiva put a book in front of the boy, but the boy couldn't learn anything until Rabbi Akiva fasted for 40 days. A heavenly voice emerged, asked, \"You're fasting on behalf of this kid?\" Rabbi Akiva responded, \"Master of the Universe, have I not prepared him before you?\" Immediately, God opened up the boy's heart, and he was able to learn Torah, the Shema and Birkat Hamazon (the grace after meals). Rabbi Akiva stood him up in front of the community to recite Barchu, and they recited, \"Baruch Hashem Hamevorach\". Immediately, they released the boy's father from his punishment. Immediately, the boy's father came to Rabbi Akiva in a dream, saying to him, \"May it be God's well that you rest for all time in the Garden of Eden, for you saved me from the punishment of Gehennom. Rabbi Akiva responded with a verse from Psalms, \"God's name is forever, God's memory passes from generation to generation.\" Therefore, the custom developed for someone who doesn't have a father or mother to say Barchu or Kaddish on Motzei Shabbat (when the souls of those in Gehennom, who have been in temporary reprieve for Shabbat, are returning to Gehennom). "

                "And people are accustomed to calling the Shabbat before Passover, the Great Shabbat (Shabbat HaGadol) but they do not know why. For behold, it is not greater (lit., bigger) than any other Shabbat. However it is because in Nissan of the year the Israelites went out of Egypt, [the day they went out] was Thursday, as it is found in Seder Olam Rabbah and in the chapter [entitled] Rabbi Akiva. And the acquisition of the Passover sacrifice was from the tenth (meaning that it was on Shabbat). The Israelites said, \"We should sacrifice the 'abomination' (god) of Egypt, and they will not stone us!?!\" The Holy One said [back] to them, \"Now you will see the wonder that I will do!\" Each person went and acquired his Passover sacrifice, to watch it until the fourteenth day [of Nissan]. When the Egyptians saw [this], they wanted to take vengeance upon them, but their innards burned, they were exhausted by fire and were punished with afflictions and difficult and bitter sicknesses. So they did not injure the Israelites at all. And because of the miracles that were done for the Israelites on that Shabbat before Pesach, that is why it is called the Great Shabbat."

                "On the seventh of Pesaḥ, the nights <small><small>before</small></small> the holiday, we sanctify it <small><small>with <i>Kiddush</i></small></small> over the wine, and we do not need to say <small><small>the blessing <i> Sheheḥeyanu </i> over the</small></small> season. And here <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Pesachim 102b:5 </i> is the proof. As it says there: <i>Because <small><small>Rav</small></small> did not say <small><small>that one recites the blessing over</small></small> the season, learn from that that we are discussing the seventh day of Pesaḥ. Whatever <small><small>wine</small></small> he had, he <small><small>already</small></small> consumed, and does not have enough <small><small>for two more cups.</small></small></i> And the explanation <small><small>for this</small></small> is that the season is included within the pilgrimage. And we pray as on the first <small><small>two</small></small> days <small><small>of Pesaḥ</small></small>, for the evening and for the morning, but in the Musaf prayer we add to the verses of <i>And you shall present </i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Numbers 28:19-24</i>, and we say, <i>And on the seventh day a sacred gathering it will be for you, all laborious work you will not do.</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Numbers 28:25</i> <i>And its offerings,</i> etc. And we take out two Torah <small><small>scrolls</small></small> and read from <i>And it was when he let them go</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Exodus 13:17</i> to <i>For I am the LORD your healer</i> <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Exodus 15:26</i>, since on the seventh day <small><small>the Israelites of the exodus</small></small> said the Song at the Sea. And the <i>mafṭir</i> reads from <i>And you shall present</i> to the end of the part<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Numbers 28:19-25</i>, and concludes in Samuel, from <i>And there was again fighting in Gath</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> II Samuel 21:20</i> to the end of the song <small><small>of David</small></small><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> II Samuel 22:51</i>, because it is a song, and it has language within it <small><small>showing similarity to language of</small></small> the exodus from Egypt, <small><small>like</small></small> <i>Smoke went up from His nostrils</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> II Samuel 22:9</i> <small><small>or</small></small> <i>And he let loose bolts</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> see II Samuel 22:9</i>. And a minor translates it all <small><small>into the Aramaic translation</small></small> verse by verse, from <i>And it was when he let them go</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Exodus 13:17</i> and from the entire song, for this <small><small>very</small></small> day Israel crossed the sea, and the section is translated to publicize miracle. And just as it is our custom to translate the Torah <small><small>into the Aramaic of Onkelos</small></small>, so too we translate the Prophet <small><small>into the Aramaic of Jonathan</small></small>. And <small><small>we</small></small> also <small><small>translate the readings</small></small> on Atzeret <small><small>that is to say, Shavuot</small></small>, but not on the other festivals. On the eighth day we read <i> Every firstborn</i> to the end of the reading<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17</i>, and conclude with Isaiah, at <i>That same day at Nob</i> up to <i>Shout and cheer</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Isaiah 10:32-12:6</i>, because the downfall of Sanḥeriv was on Pesaḥ.

                "1 What is an open paragraph (parasha petuha)? Anything which is written from the start of the line to its middle, or to a third of the way through; or so that there is space to write three words of three letters, that is, lemishpahoteikhem. That is a petuha. And if it happens that the end of the verse is at the end of the line, with less than the required space, he leaves a second blank line and starts the new paragraph on the third line; that is also a petuha. A closed paragraph (setuma): when there is writing at both ends of the line and a blank space in the middle, sufficient to write two letters or more. That is a setuma. A sedura paragraph: when the line is written to the middle or a third of the way through, and then he leaves the rest blank, and restarts on the next line, directly below where he left off in the line above. That is a sedura. This I found in an old siddur. ",
                "2 Masekhet Soferim has different definitions: a petuha is anything which  does not start at the head of the line. A setuma is anything that stops in the middle of the line. How much must be left at the beginning of the line for it to be called a petuha? Enough to write a word of three letters. How much must be left in the middle of the line for it to be called a setuma? Enough to write a word of three letters. [End Masekhet Soferim quote.] Suppose he finished a paragraph at the edge of the page and started a new line, and left enough space at the beginning of that line to write three letters, and then started to write? Come and learn from the two sources; the baraita gives the essence of the issue. The baraita reasons that the beginning of the line is what determines a petuha, not the end of the line [so the example case is a petuha according to the baraita]; if one leaves a gap at the beginning and also at the end of the line, it is still a petuha. But the old siddur reasons that it is the end of the line that determines a petuha, not the beginning of the line [so the example case is a setuma according to the baraita]. [To avoid ambiguity, therefore...] if he makes a petuha with space both at the end of the line and at the beginning of the line it is good for both of them. This is correct. There is also another order of petuhot and setumot which seems entirely unconvincing. And these are the tagin of a sefer Torah and the petuhot and setumot according to the masoretic tradition. ביה שמו: the following words should be placed at the beginning of a line and the top of a column: Bereshit (Gen. 1:1); Yehudah ata yodukha (Gen. 49:8); Haba-im ahareihem bayam (Ex. 14:28); Shemor ve-shamarta (Deut. 12:28); Motza sefateikha (Deut. 23:24); Ve-a'ida bam (Deut. 31:28).",
