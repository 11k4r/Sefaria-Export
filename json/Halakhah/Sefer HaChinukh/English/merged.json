                "From the roots of this commandment (i.e the reason behind this commandment) is that the world should be settled (Gittin 41b) because God wants the world to be settled, as it says (Isaiah 45:18), \"I did not create it for naught, but [rather] formed it for habitation.\" This is a great commandment, through which all the commandments are observed, as [the Torah] was given to humans [who need to procreate] and not to angels [who don't] (Berakhot 25b).",

This commandment is not obligatory for women. One who refrains from this commandment is responsible for not engaging in a positive commandment and his punishment is very great (Kiddushin 29b), because he shows that he does not want to fulfill God's will to settle the world."

And the practice of this commandment [involves] cutting the foreskin that covers the head of the member and then tearing the sorting skin which is below it so that the glans of the member will be exposed. As is known to those that understand, the completion of the form of man comes with the removal of this foreskin which is extraneous. ",

To separate them from the other nations in their physical body just like they are separated from them in the nature of their souls, the going out and coming in of which are not similar. He established this difference in the 'golden fountain,' because this is the reason for the existence of people, besides being a completion of the physical body as we mentioned. God wanted to complete his plan with the chosen nation. He wanted men to complete the creation of his body, as he did not create him complete from the womb; [so as] to hint that just like men can complete his own physical body, so [too] can he complete his spiritual form, by his having proper actions.",

And there in Shabbat, it is elucidated that the circumciser recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with Your commandments, and commanded us concerning the circumcision.\" And the father of the child - or the court when there is no father [present] - recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with Your commandments, and commanded us to bring him into the covenant of Avraham, our father.\" And the ones standing there respond, \"Just as he had merit for the circumcision, may God let have him merit for the wedding canopy and for good deeds\" (see Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 260-266).

But the father is not liable for excision for the [lack of] circumcision of his son (Shabbat 133a), but he does transgress a positive commandment.

And in continually remembering this idea through the commandment that serves as a reminder, they will stand firm in their faith and righteousness forever.

                "<b>The commandment of sanctifying the new month:</b> To sanctify months and intercalate [months into] years in the Court [whose members are the] greatest in wisdom and ordained in the Land of Israel, and to establish the year's holidays according to that sanctification, as it is stated (Exodus 12:2), \"This month shall be to you the first of months.\" This means, when you see the renewal of the moon, establish for yourselves the new month, or even if you do not see it, since it is appropriate for [the moon] to appear according to the accepted calculation. Likewise, this commandment includes the commandment of intercalation, since the basis of the commandment to sanctify the month is for Israel to observe God's holidays at their appointed times. And the commandment of intercalation  has the same basis. However, beyond this verse are more Torah passages concerning the commandment of intercalation, and that is what is written (Exodus 13:10), \"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time\"; and likewise, \"Observe the month of Spring\" (Deuteronomy 16:11).", 
                "The content of the commandment is that two Jews fit to testify come before the court and testify before them that they saw the renewed moon. [The judges then] establish the new month on the basis of their [testimony] and say, \"Today has been sanctified.\" The reason why this commandment applies only with ordained judges is because it came with the interpretation [of the verse], \"This month shall be for you,\" i.e. great [in Torah] and ordained, like you (Rosh Hashanah 22a), since [this verse] was said to Moses and Aaron. This matter was further expounded, as it is juxtaposed to \"speak to the entire congregation of the children of Israel,\" meaning that they who sanctify the month must have the assent of all Israel, meaning the wisest men of Israel, such as the Great Court (the Sanhedrin). And so [too] any great sage in Israel who was ordained in the Land of Israel. And since ordination is no longer practiced, as is known, [the sage] has permission to perform this commandment even outside the Land of Israel, so long as there is no one of his stature in the Land of Israel. And so we find that Chananiah ben Achai, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Akiva ben Yosef did so in this regard (Berakhot 23a). But without these conditions, no one of Israel is permitted to establish the months or intercalate. And if you ask: If so, how do we conduct ourselves today, when we lack ordained sages? Know that thus we have received [our calendar], since Rabbi Hillel the Prince, son of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, who was the greatest of his generation and ordained in the Land of Israel—he was the sage who fixed for us the calculation of intercalation, sanctified future months, and intercalated  future [months into] years until the coming of Eliyahu (i.e. until the Messianic Era), and it is upon this that we rely today. That which we have said all follows the opinion of Rambam. However, Ramban (in the Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 153), considers the sanctification of the month as one commandment and intercalation a separate commandment. His proofs (for dividing these into two separate commandments are) in his Book of Commandments. And so [too] the Ba'al Halakhot (considers these separate commandments). And the verse that teaches about the commandment of intercalation, that is, that we calculate the seasons in order to make the holidays in their (proper,) established times, is \"\"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time,\" (Exodus 13:10) and so, \"Observe the month of Spring,\" (Deuteronomy 16:11) as we have written.", 
                "From the roots of this commandment are so that Israel shall make God's holidays in their (proper) times, as God commanded that we make Pesach in the time that the produce is in [bloom], as it is written (Deuteronomy 16:1), \"Observe the month of Spring, and you shall offer the Pesach sacrifice.\"  And the holiday of Sukkot is [to fall] at the time of the harvest, as is written,  \"And the Festival of the Harvest at the turn of the year.\" (Exodus 34:22) And were it not for intercalation, the holidays would come not at these times, since Israel calculates their months and festivals according to the lunar year, which has 354 days, 8 hours, and 876 halakim , which is less than the solar year by 10 days, 21 hours, and 204 halakim, (a mnemonic: 10, 21, 204). Due to the ripening of the produce and fruit from the power of the sun, it turns out that but for intercalation, by which we align the lunar and solar years, Pesach would not come in Spring, nor Sukkot at the time of the harvest. And this matter is to be fixed by the greatest [sages] of the generation, since it is a matter requiring great wisdom, and since it is also said that from this [calculation one comes to know] the agricultural happenings of the year, it is appropriate to give [this task] only to great and pious men.", 
                "The laws of the commandment—for example, interrogating [those who offer] testimony concerning the new month; instilling fear in the witnesses on occasion; the law concerning circumstances under which the Shabbat may be desecrated for this testimony; for what [considerations] we do or do not intercalate; which month they would intercalate, i.e. Adar, as [our Sages] expounded, \"'You shall observe this commandment in its proper time' (Exodus 13:10), this teaches that we only intercalate at the time near the holiday\"; and furthermore did they expound on this verse, \"From where do we know that we only intercalate the month during daytime? [We learn this from the] verse, [which] states, 'from year to year' (<i>yamim yemima</i>, literally from day to day) (Sanhedrin 10b); and furthermore did they expound, \"'For the months of the year' (Exodus 12:2)—it is months you calculate towards the year, not days\" (Megillah 5a); furthermore did they say on this matter, \"'A month's time (<i>hodesh yamim</i>)'—it is days (<i>yamim</i>) you calculate towards the month, not hours\" (Megillah 5a); and the rest of its details—are [all] explained in Tractate Rosh Hashanah 25b, and in the first chapter of Sanhedrin 11b, and similarly in Berakhot. (See Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sanctification of the New Month 1)", 
                "[This commandment] is practiced in all places and at all times when we have ordained sages, according to the aforementioned conditions. One who transgresses and does not [sanctify the new month or intercalate the month], if he be a sage for whom it is appropriate, has nullified a positive commandment, and his punishment is very great since he causes the ruining of the holidays. And now, when in our sins we no longer have intercalation by ordained [scholars], our calculation relies on the accepted calculation from Rabbi Hillel, as we have said. "

And so [too], \"All tithes of the herd or flock\" (Leviticus 27:32) is only one commandment to separate to give the tithes of these animals.

As it is stated (Exodus 12:20), \"All that is leavened shall you not eat\" - and they, may their memory be blessed, explained (Pesachim 43a) about it that the content of the verse teaches about this; as such did they receive the transmission about it. And the opinion of Rambam (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 198), may his memory be blessed, is that if there is in these foods a <i>kazayit</i> (the size of a large olive) of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i> (a half-loaf of bread), it is forbidden by the Torah as a negative commandment - meaning to say for lashes, but not for excision, since it is mixed with a majority [of non-chamets products]. But if there is not in them a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i>, there are no [formal] lashes, but rather [just] lashes of rebellion - as it is only prohibited rabbinically. And so is it written in his great essay (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1:6). And if so - according to his opinion - this prohibition of \"All that is leavened\" comes upon when a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i> is mixed in, that there should be a negative commandment - meaning to say [for] lashes, not excision. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrote the opposite of this (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 198) and said that this negative commandment is not considered [a separate commandment] among the negative commandments, but rather is one of the many negative commandments [included in the prohibition] of leaven and chamets. And this prohibition (of \"All that is leavened\") is coming to teach about that which the sages, may their memory be blessed, said in the Gemara (Pesachim 28b), \"I only [know] if it became leavened on its own. From where [do I derive] if it became leavened due to another substance? Hence the verse comes to teach, 'All that is leavened.'\" But concerning chamets that is mixed, anytime there is a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i>, there is no need for a separate negative commandment about it - as behold, it is as if it is intact and it [comes with] excision. And if there is not a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i>, one who eats it is exempt [from the prohibition], but [still doing something] forbidden. As the law is like the words of the sages (Pesachim 43a) that said [that] on complete leavened grain products, one is punished with excision. And anything that is a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i> is called a complete leavened grain product. And about its mixture - meaning less than a <i>kazayit</i> of chamets [that is eaten] in the time it takes to eat a <i>peras</i> - [there] is no [prohibition].

As we have found in the Torah that a person has the power to consecrate what is his, with the words of his mouth; and they will immediately be forbidden to him and to the whole world, as it is written (Leviticus 27:14), \"And if a man consecrates his home to be holy.\" And so [too], does he have power over himself to forbid things upon his body. This is their, may their memory be blessed, always saying in the expressions of vows (Nedarim 15a), \"Behold, it is upon me\" - or (Nedarim 13b), \"my mouth\" for speech - meaning to say that he distances that thing from him. And he has the power to bind himself with a prohibition of that thing, [just] like he has the power to forbid his possessions. And that is itself the law and the reason why [only] an oath can rest upon something of substance [as well as] something that is not of substance (Nedarim 15b), since the oath lodges upon the body of the person, meaning to say that his body is obligated to do that thing - and behold, the body has substance. However a vow only rests upon something that has substance, as it is like him placing something into the category of other things that are forbidden; meaning to say that thing x will be forbidden to him like the category of the sacrifice that is forbidden to him. And if there is no substance to that which he is [literally] placing in the category, he has not done anything and it is nothing. ", 
                "And so from this reason, an oath cannot rest upon an oath [about the same matter], but a vow can rest upon a vow [about the same matter].  As with an oath, behold once a man has himself entered into the partition of [something's] existence, as we have said, even if he repeats his word that he is entering there a thousand times, the entrance of his body into another place is done [only] one time. And this that he does after that is only repeating words pointlessly. But with a vow in which he is like one that accepts upon himself that something permissible is as if it is forbidden; with each time that he repeats his acceptance, he adds [a further] prohibition if he [breaks his vow]. And hence he is liable for each and every one. And it is the same matter itself that an oath cannot rest upon the matter of a commandment (Nedarim 16a), but a vow can rest even upon the matter of a commandment. As one who makes an oath speaks about his body, and his body is already obligated in that matter [of the commandment] from Mount Sinai. But with a vow, he is only speaking about the object that he wants to bring into the category of the forbidden, and about this specific object, he was never obligated. And hence [his new] prohibition rests upon it. And we do not feed a person something that is forbidden for him [because of an oath or a vow]. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Ran on Nedarim 8a, s. v. Vehalo mushva) that the one who makes an oath forbids himself to the object and the one who makes a vow forbids the object to himself.", 
                "And you may ask, how is it that the one who makes a vow not to eat something that he is commanded about to eat, does not eat it - as behold, he is commanded about that thing with a positive commandment; and a positive commandment comes and pushes off the negative commandment of \"he shall not break.\" As so did the sages say in every place, \"a positive commandments comes and pushes off a negative commandment.\" The answer to you is that the vow is a positive commandment and there is [also] a negative commandment in it: the negative commandment is \"he shall not break,\" and the positive commandment is \"everything that comes out of his mouth he shall do.\" And from the reason that we gave [before] that his body is acted upon with an oath, they said (Shevuot 20a) [that] one that is added on with an oath [of someone else] is exempt [from it]; but with vows, he is obligated. How so? If he heard that his fellow made a vow and he said, \"I am also like you,\" within the time of speech (immediately after it), behold this one is forbidden, since the intention of this one is to say, [just] like you are forbidden from this thing, so too will I be forbidden from it, and with this, it will be sufficient for him. But with an oath, wherein we picture the first one as if he acts upon his body with his words - as we have said - he has not removed something else away from his body; they, may their memory be blessed, did not see that this later one is included in this movement by saying, \"I am also like you.\" [Rather,] he must speak out the expression of this movement with his actual mouth - for example, if he says, \"I too swear like you\"; or if he hears from the mouth of someone who moves him [specifically] to that thing, and he fulfills it and indicates that he wants this movement, like when another man says to him, \"I put an oath upon you,\" and he answers, \"Amen.\"  ", 
                "The general principle of the thing is that the language of the oath must be said by his own mouth or that someone else specifically refers it to him and he accepts [it]. But he is not moved by the movement of another man, since his [own] body needs the movement; [but this] is not the case with a vow. [It is also] possible to say that it is from the strictness of a vow that they were stricter about it, that one should be added on more quickly than with an oath; since it is stricter than an oath, as behold, they compare it to the life of the King (Sifrei Bamidbar 123:3, see Ramban on Bamidbar 30:3). And from the reason that we wrote about an oath, that its content is that a man concludes to fulfill his words and to confirm [them by that which] he believes in the Divine existence, we would have learned that his oath cannot be nullified from any angle. But it was from the kindnesses of God to us - in His knowing the frailty of the structure of our body and the smallness of our opinions and the constancy of the change of our wills - to give us counsel to get out from the prison of the  oath with the [change] of our will at any time: he allowed us to make the claim regarding the matter of the oath that it was under duress or inadvertent, as is explained in its place in Shevuot 26a and Nedarim 20b. ", 
                "However, we were not permitted to go out from it [wantonly, but] rather [only] with the stratagem and counsel of the sage; that the one who swore come in front of the man who is wise and understanding of the ways of the Torah and confess to him that [the oath] was from his lack of knowledge - that he did not know at the time that he swore something that he knew afterwards - that he wants to annul what he swore about (Nedarim 71a); and that he recognizes that the smallness of his knowledge and his lacking caused the annulment, not something else or an external thought that would be in his heart, God forbid. And after the confession of his mouth about this, the sage recognizes and sees that there is substance in his words that something new happened to him that if he had had to agree to it at the time that he swore, he  would not have sworn and that this is why he regrets [it]; he accepts his confession and he releases him from his oath. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berachot 32b), \"He cannot forgive [it], but others can forgive it to him.\" Therefore it is never possible  to annul an oath, except with the reason of something new to the one who swore - for example, that he will say, \"If I had known thing x, I would never have sworn.\" As this is like duress. But if he says, \"Annul me my oath,\" without a claim, no man has the power to annul it. And based on this, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 64a) that we do not create an opening (to annul the vow) with something new that is not found (that has not happened). As [with this] he does not clearly say that he regrets that he swore - that we should consider it duress - but rather that his will today is like it was at the beginning, but he [just] wants it annulled now. How is this? He swears that he not benefit from x and [x] becomes the town scribe or butcher, and he says, \"My will [still] stands that I did not want to benefit from him and I [also] did not want him to become the scribe or the butcher.\" We do not annul [it] for him until he says, \"Since I see that this man has become the scribe, I regret that I swore [off] his benefit forever. And if only I had not sworn!\" In this way, we annul [it] for him; as behold, he concedes that his will has changed and that he regrets his deeds completely, due to the lack of his knowledge - as had he known at the time of the oath what he knows today, he never would have sworn. And it is like duress. And we expound (Shevuot 26a), \"'A man with an oath' (Leviticus 5:4) - to exclude duress.\"", 
                "And from this foundation - also when he makes his oath depend on the mind of others, it is difficult to annul it. As since he has removed his [own] mind from the thing and made it depend on the mind of others, afterwards the claim of duress or inadvertence is not found with him. And this is what they said (Gittin 36a) that one who swears upon the mind of others does not have annulment. And nonetheless for a matter of a commandment, the sages agreed to annul [it. This is] because [regarding] everything that a man does, which is something that causes the negation of a commandment or that a commandment is performed by not doing that thing, the heart of any Jew would [want] to negate the private action and do the commandment. And [so] we see [it] as if all of the [others] upon whose minds he swore were with him in front of him [now] and say that if they knew [about] the negation of the commandment [coming from] his oath, their minds would not have agreed with him. And behold, we have a claim of duress and inadvertence. And therefore they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 16b), \"But there is annulment for the matter of a commandment.\"  ", 
                "And do not think to challenge me about the giving of this reason that I have said that the main annulment [comes from] something new happening to a man, that had he known about it from the beginning, he would not have sworn - and say behold, we have found annulment regarding the oaths of God, may He be blessed, as they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Berakhot 32b) about \"And Moshe beseeched\" (Exodus 32:11), that, as if it were possible, he annulled His oath [for] Him; and the matter of Zerubavel the son of Shaltiel, [about whom] they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 38a) that he was asked by God [to annul] His oath, and God forbid that there should be a change of will with Him. As one can answer you, and it is [perfectly] true, that everything that comes in Scripture similar to these matters is all stated from the angle of the receivers, which are people. As God forbid to Him and for our hearts to believe that the Master of all would need to swear about something, or that He would need to annul it and negate it afterwards. Rather this thing is said from the angle of receiving punishment which comes to the one punished - that if a man is liable, due to the greatness of his sin, that he be punished regardless, to the point where it is not fitting to give him [the possibility] of repentance, the notion of an oath of God will come upon such a man; meaning to say [that] his punishment and decree is strongly upon him as if there were an oath on the thing. And so [too], for the good: if a man merited, from his great significance, to receive good - he and his children - the verse will also state that God, may He be blessed, swore to benefit him.", 
                "And about this and that which is similar to it, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 19:19:1) [it is] in order to (assuage - Vilna edition) break the ear to that which it can hear (make it understandable). As the strength and persistence of a thing cannot be illustrated to people except with that which they strengthen and keep their [own] words. And in this way exactly did they, may their memory be blessed, expound the annulment of the oath of God, may He be blessed: They wanted to say that He is 'graceful and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness,' and atones for sins, even though their sins are great and strong to the point that if a man sinned to another so much, [the one offended] would swear never to forgive [the other]. And upon this approach, they, may their memory be blessed, said that Moshe annulled it; meaning to say that it was the merit of Moshe's good prayer that caused God, may He be blessed - who is the Listener to prayer - to have forgiven their sin. And this is [why] you will not find that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed,  expound about the matter of the annulment of an oath of His, may He be blessed, except with a great sin - such that every listener will [understand] that it not given to atonement; meaning to say it is fitting to swear about it that it should not be atoned. But His mercies, Blessed be He, were greater than all of our thoughts, and He atones for all those who return to Him - and even if their sin is too heavy to bear - according to my opinion. ", 
                "And the proof to these words of ours is that which they said (Rosh Hashanah 18a) concerning a [Divine] decree that has an oath with it, as Rava concludes there, that it is not atoned with a sacrifice or a grain offering, but rather it is atoned with words of Torah; and they have no mention there that God would need to annul [His oath]. As the matters are known and clear to all who see the sun that it is all said metaphorically for the receivers. And in order to direct you on this path in many places, I have been lengthy about this until now.", 
                "And [regarding] that which I said that our Sages, may their memory be blessed, ascribe the term, annulment, to an oath of God, may He be blessed; you will only find this in a place that they attributed to Him an oath to make a creature liable. But in a place where they attributed to Him an oath to give merit to a creature, they never mention annulment - as the One of great kindness, inclines towards kindness. I mean to say that once a person appears meritorious at one time in front of the Omnipresent, it is so fitting for him to receive the good [that] it is as if the Holy One, blessed be He, swore the goodly reward to him. It is like the matter that is stated (Psalms 132:11), \"The Lord swore to David,\" and similar to it - [it means] the merit will no longer go away from him, even if he sins greatly. And this is from His precious traits, blessed be He. ", 
                "The laws of the commandment - for example, appellations for oaths, [about] which they, may their memory be blessed, said that they are like an oath [and the explanation of appellations for oaths are the many terms that exist among people, according to their places, like what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nedarim 10a), \"<i>Shevuta, shekuka, etc.</i>\"]; so [too], the law [if one says,] \"a curse (<i>allah</i>)\" or \"cursed (<i>aroor</i>)\" whether they are like oaths (Shevout 36a); one who says \"no\" with the mention of God, and so [too], \"right or left (Nazir 3b); the law of his mouth and heart being [in agreement], and that which we learned from this law of his mouth and heart being [in agreement], that we are able to make [deceptive] oaths to killers and plunderers, like [if] he say that all the fruits in the world are forbidden to him if there be such and such, and in his heart is that they only be forbidden for today (Nedarim 27b), and even though it generally implies forever, but it is only permitted to us like this, when the words of his mouth do not completely contradict the thought of his heart, and not in any other way; and the rest of its many details - are [all] in Shevuot and Nedarim (See Tur, Yoreh Deah 236).",

And even though there is no act, the Torah made him liable for lashes due to the severity of the matter (Shevuot 27b). And he is exempted from a sacrifice for this, when inadvertent. But with a false oath - and that is what is called an oath of expression - the Torah obligated a sacrifice for inadvertence, as we shall write (Sefer HaChinukh 123) with God's help."

                "<b>The commandment of the sanctification of Shabbat with words:</b> To speak words on the Shabbat upon its entry and also its departure - that there be in them cognizance of the greatness of the day and its stature and its positive distinction from the other days before it and after it; as it is stated (Exodus 20:8), \"Remember the Shabbat day, to sanctify it,\" meaning to say, remember it with a memory of [its] holiness and greatness. And in explanation, our Sages told us (Pesachim 110a) that we are commanded to say these things upon wine - as so does the explanation come: remember it over wine. And the content is that we place into a cup a <i>reviit</i> or more of pure or mixed wine, but not less than this (Pesachim 108b). And it is known that the [proportions of the] mixture is one part pure good wine to three parts water. And we recite the blessing of the sanctification of Shabbat upon it, according to the wording that is known among the Jews. And so [too], at the departure of Shabbat, we recite the blessing over the wine in honor of the day - and that blessing of the conclusion of Shabbat is called Havdalah (Berakhot 52a). ", 
                "From the roots of this commandment are in order that we be aroused through this act to remember the greatness of the day and that we fix upon our hearts faith in the creation of the world, \"that in six days the Lord made, etc.\" (Exodus 20:11). And therefore, we are obligated to do an act with wine - since the nature of man is to be greatly aroused by it (Berakhot 35b), as it satiates and causes joy. And I have already said to you that according to the arousal of a man and his acts will he always be acted upon towards things. And from this root did they, may their memory be blessed, say in the Gemara (Pesachim 106b), that if bread is more beloved to a person, he should sanctify [the day] over bread - since then his nature will be more aroused by that which he craves. And even though in the departure of the day, they did not say this, but rather obligated him to recite Havdalah with wine nonetheless, they were correct with this as well; since they, may their memory be blessed, as well as the perfect Torah, will always choose to go according to the majority. And in truth, the majority of the world will desire drinking over eating at the conclusion of Shabbat; since they have already [eaten] a large meal during the day in honor of the Shabbat. And there is no need to give a reason for their obligating us that there be a <i>reviit</i> of wine in the cup; since less than this amount is not fitting and will not arouse the heart of a man upon it. And that which they obligated us in rinsing the cup (Berakhot 51a), and not to drink anything until he recites the sanctification (Pesachim 105a) and that he recites the sanctification at the location of his meal - all of [these] are branches of the root of arousal that I [discussed].",

                "<b>Not to perform labor on Shabbat:</b> To not perform labor on the day of Shabbat ourselves; and not allow our children, slaves and animals to do so, as it is stated (Exodus 20:10), \"do not perform any labor, etc.\" There is no doubt that even though the verse issues a [single blanket] prohibition on us, our children, servants, and animals, they are not all equal; as we see that one who volitionaly performs labor with his own body will be liable for the death penalty in a court. But with the labor of others - even though he is warned about them with a negative commandment - he is not liable for them; [not] even with lashes, as lashes are never for the act of others. And from the language of Rambam, may his memory be blessed, (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sabbath 20:1) it is implied that he holds that this prohibition of \"do not perform any labor, you [...] and your animal,\" comes upon letting an animal work (<i>mechamer</i>) while being behind it - for example, that he is using it to plow. As, according to his opinion, letting an animal work by itself is only a prohibition [embedded] in a positive commandment. And hence, according to his opinion, they said in the Gemara (Shabbat 154a) that this negative commandment of letting your animals do work is a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court - meaning to say, that a man is killed for it, and [so] there are no lashes for it. But Ramban, may his memory be blessed, (on Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Shorashim 14) wrangles with him greatly on this explanation, and says that this negative commandment of letting your animals do work is only about walking behind his animal laden with his load, while the man does not do any act with his hands. And therefore neither lashes nor the death penalty would ever come to him; and it is as that which has been established for us, we do not administer lashes for any negative commandment that does not have an act. [And it is] like they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Shabbat 154b), \"'You [...] and your animal' - let it write, 'do not perform labor and your animal'; why do I need 'you?' [To tell you] that when he performs labor, he is liable, but for the labor of his animal he is not liable.\" Rather, he is [just] warned about it with a negative commandment, like with the labor of his young child and his Canaanite slave. But for his own actual labor - for that there was no reason to say that he is liable, as behold, his punishment is explicit (Exodus 34:2), \"any one who performs labor on it shall die.\" And according to the opinion of Ramban, may his memory be blessed, the explanation of that which they said in the Gemara about the negative commandment of letting your animal do work, that it is a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court, is that since it also includes the other [types of] labor which [come] with a warning of a death penalty from the court - even though with letting your animal work there is certainly only a negative commandment, as there is also not [even] lashes with it - nonetheless, this negative commandment is [called] a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court because of those things that it includes that have death penalties of the court. And similar to this did they, may their memory be blessed, say in the first chapter of Eruvin 17b about the negative commandment of \"let no man leave his place\": Since it also includes carrying out from one domain to another - like the teaching that they expounded, [read, do not go out (<i>yetseh</i>), as] do not carry out (<i>yotsee</i>) - that it is from now a negative commandment that is given over to the warning of a death penalty from the court in some of its matters. And since it is so, we can say that we do not administer lashes for it, in all of its matters. And in exactly the same way, we can explain the negative commandment of not letting your animal do work here.  ", 
                "Form the roots of this commandment is that we should be free from our preoccupations in honor of the day [of Shabbat], in order to instill within our souls faithfulness to the [concept of the] universe's creation, which is [a concept that affects many fundamental principles in Judaism] (lit. a rope that drags along all the foundations of our religion). And we remember once a week, every week, that the universe was created in six distinct days, that nothing was created on the seventh day, and that different [types of creations] were brought into being each day. [All of this confirms the Torah's philosophical idea of God's] Simple (Single) Will, which differs from the philosophers' view, that disgusts us in their idea regarding this matter that [alongside] the Blessed One['s existence] was everything. And through our rest on the seventh day we are reminded of the universe's creation; because, when everyone simultaneously  rests once a week, curious people will ask what is the point of this rest?  And the answer will be \"because [in] six days God created, etc.\" (Exodus 31:17). [And through that answer], everyone will be  strengthened in the true faith. And in addition to remembering the universe's creation, there is in [Shabbat] also a remembering of the miracle of [the Exodus from] Egypt - that we were slaves there and we were not able to rest whenever we desired to rest, and God saved us from their hands and commanded us to rest on the seventh day (Shabbat). Therefore, the second root is mentioned in Deuteronomy (lit. the repetition of the Torah), as it states in the [context of] the commandment of Shabbat \"And you should remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, etc. therefore the Lord, your God, commanded you to [observe] (lit. make) the day of Shabbat\" (Deuteronomy 5:15).",

And if a disagreement breaks out between them about the matter, we must judge the case between them, as it is stated about this as it is written in this section (Exodus 22:13), “And if a man borrows from his neighbor, etc.” And regarding the law of the borrower, the Torah made [him] liable even for things beyond his control, as it is his responsibility; since he borrowed it and did not put out any thing of his for it, behold he is like one who took out a monetary loan, who if something beyond his control occurred to him would not be exempt from [paying the] creditor, with the claim that it was beyond his control. And about the matter that he is exempt if borrowing in the presence of the owners, we can say according to the simple understanding that the Torah did not make the borrower liable since the owner of the vessel or or the animal is with him - as since he is there, he will guard what is his. And even though the borrower is [still] exempt after the owners left [him], if they are there at the time of the borrowing, it is possible to answer about this that the Torah did not want to give different measurements for its words and state that if the owners stay long, he will be exempt, but if [only] a little, he will be liable. [Instead,] the Torah commanded more generally that so long as the owners are there at the time of the borrowing, he will be exempt. And this is the reason that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Metzia 95b), that if he was there with him at the time of the borrowing – even if he was not with him at the time of it breaking or dying – he is exempt; but if he was with him at the time of the breaking or the dying but he was not there at the time of the borrowing, he is liable; since the procedure depends on the beginning of the matter.

I do not have to write at length about it, as the things are well-known. And therefore we were commanded to put away from the world someone who makes efforts with this, as he is coming against the will of God, as He desires [the world's] settlement and that everything should be administered in a natural way. As nature was at the beginning of creation and this one wants to change everything. And according to my opinion, the matter of magic is that at the beginning of creation, God, blessed be He, placed for each and every thing in the world a nature [through which] to accomplish its action well and straight, for the good of the creatures of the world that He created; and He commanded each one to act according to its species, as it is written about all the creatures, in Parshat Bereshit (Genesis 1:12), “according to its species.” And He also made a higher force govern each and every one from above, to compel it to perform its action; as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bereshit Rabbah 1), “There is no [blade of] grass below that does not have a constellation above that tells it, 'Grow!'”And besides the action that each and every one does according to its nature, there is another action that they have, by mixing one specie with another. And in the craft of this mixing there are some angles that were not permitted for people to utilize, because God knows that the end result that will come out for people from these angles will be bad for them. And on account of this, He prevented them from them. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said more generally (Shabbat 67b), “Anything that has healing in it does not have the 'ways of the Amorite' in it”; meaning to say, it should not be forbidden from the perspective of magic – since there is a benefit to it that is found from true experience, it is not from the forbidden angles, as they are only forbidden because of the perspective of their damage. And there is another matter in these forbidden angles of mixture and machinations for which they were forbidden. [It is] because the power of this mixture is so strong that it nullifies the power of the constellations that are assigned upon the two species. And the illustration of this is that it is just like that which you see with the grafting of one specie with a different one, that a new third specie is created. It comes out that the grafting nullifies the power of both of them. And so we have been prevented from bringing up to our minds to switch the perfect acts of God, even if it comes out in our hand something that appears to be pleasing.",

Because it contradicts the retinue (<i>makhishin pamaliah</i>) on high and on low,” is meaning to say that their power temporarily overrides the power of those forces appointed over them. And see the precision of their words, may their memory blessed, as they said, “the retinue on high,” and they did not say, “the decree of High – since God, blessed be He, decreed it and wanted from the beginning of creation that this action would come out from the two of them when they are mixed. And there is an open rebuke from it towards those appointed over them. However, they said that the power of the retinue on high is contradicted regardless. And one whose intellect is close to the light of the face of the King and the power of his merit overrides the power of those appointed, will not fear from this phenomenon, as we found that the sage said to the witch in the Gemara (Shabbat 81, Sanhedrin 67b).",

As behold, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sanhedrin 67b), \"'With their tricks'  that is the work of demons; 'with their spells,' that is the work of magic.\" It is implied from this that the matter of magic is possible to do without demons. However, sometimes it is also done with demons. And those demons that are used for the craft of magic are called angels of destruction.

If the fruits depreciated, the buyers may not recall [it], as the power of a commoner should not be weightier than their power. And so [too], if they bought the fruit and they pulled them and did not give the value and they appreciated, the seller cannot recall [it], so that the power of the commoner not be greater than their power. But if they depreciated, they could recall [it]; however for the sake of their welfare, [the rabbis] said they are not able to recall [it], so that they will be able to find someone to sell them fruit on credit. If they gave the value to the seller for fruit and they did not pull the fruit and the fruit depreciated, they can recall [it]. And this is the one [case] that we said they have an advantage over consecrated property. As consecrated property cannot be recalled in this case, as since in the same case with a commoner there is a [curse called] the One who repayed [placed upon the one who recalls the sale], the sages did not want to apply a lowly trait for [such] a small gain for consecrated property. But with orphans, it is enough for them to be like the rest of the people, and since the rest of the people can recall [in this case], according to [the letter of] the law - except that they [are given a curse] - it is correct that (orphans, who do not receive a curse), [be allowed] to recall. [If] the orphans gave the value and did not pull the fruit and they appreciated, the sellers may recall, [though] they recall and receive [a curse]. But this is for the welfare [of the orphans], as if their law would be that they acquire with the giving of money, the seller would tell them that they burned up or got lost beyond his control. And if you might say, they should be in their possession for any benefit of theirs - that if they want, they take them regardless, and if they do not, they do not take them - so that the buyer not give this answer; your answer is that it is impossible to do all this for them, as it is not correct to give them the property of [other] people. It is enough for them that for their benefit we sometimes [administer] Torah law upon them and sometimes [administer] rabbinic law upon them. But above all this, it is not correct to give them the money of the [rest of] the world, and similar to that which they said about them in the Gemara, (Bava Metzia 70a), \"Orphans that consume what is not theirs will go after those that left them.\" [If] the orphans took the value for their fruit and the buyer did not pull some of them and they depreciated, the buyers can recall according to the law and receive [a curse]. As if you say, \"Let us [administer] Torah law upon them, and since the buyers gave the money, they acquired the fruit and the buyers may not recall,\" this would be bad for the orphans, as they would never find someone who will advance them money for their fruits. And it is possible that they will need money at that time, and it will come out for them that this advantage will sometimes be a great loss. And so [the rabbis] investigated every side of their benefit that was possible and arranged it for them.", 
                "And the orphans never receive [a curse] for anything that the custodian does, nor also does the custodian, since he is recalling on their behalf (Bava Metzia 74b). And so [too] is the law more generally regarding an agent who gives and takes with the knowledge of his sender, that neither of them receive [a curse]. And nonetheless, they said about them that it is permitted to oppress them  a little for their benefit - for example a teacher towards his student in Torah or in a craft. However even for their benefit, it is a commandment to be more lenient upon them than upon other people. And they also said that there is a covenant made with them that their cries will be answered, as it is stated (Exodus 22:22), \"I will surely hear his cry\"; and that they are called orphans regarding the matter of this commandment until they do not need an adult for their business affairs, but rather administer all of their own needs like all other adults.

And even though we do not administer lashes for this - as the affliction is not something [clearly] defined, such that we can give lashes for it, as the evil afflicter can make the lying claim that he afflicted them according to the law or for their benefit - God, may He be blessed, who examines the hearts, will [redress] their pain. And behold his punishment is explicit in the Torah, as it is stated (Exodus 22:23), \"and I shall kill you with the sword\" - meaning to say, measure for measure, such that the wives of the afflicters become widows and their children, orphans, and not find someone who has mercy upon them. As in the way that a person measures, so will he be measured (Sotah 8b). And if the afflicter is a female, she will die and her husband will marry another woman who will afflict her children. And they, may their memory be blessed, expounded, \"if he will surely cry to Me\" - a son complains to his father, a wife to her husband, a widow and orphan to Me, \"and I will listen, as I am gracious\" (Exodus 22:26).

And if it were not from the angle of this root, does He, blessed be He, not have enough for the lacking of the poor person without us? Rather, it was from His kindness, blessed be He, that he made us His messengers to give us merit. And there is also another reason in the matter - that God, blessed be He, wanted to support the poor person through [other] people because of the greatness of [that person's] sin, so that he be chastised by pain in two ways: by the contracting of embarrassment through those his age; and by the reduction of his food. And in the manner that we said [that it is] in order to give us merit did a sage from our sages answer a certain heretic who asked him if God loves the poor - as He commanded [to help] them - why does He not provide for them, etc., as it appears in Tractate Bava Batra 10a.",

                "At the root of this commandment lies the reason that the body is an instrument of the soul: with it, it carries out its activity; without it, it can never complete its work. And hence it is in its shadow truly for its good, and not for its bad; as God does not do bad but does good to all. Thus we find that the body at its command is like a pair of tongs in the hand of a blacksmith: with it he can produce a tool fit for its purpose. Now in truth, if the tongs are strong and properly shaped to grasp tools in them, the craftsman can make them well. But if the tongs are not good, the tools will never come out properly shaped and fit. In the same way, if there is any damage in the body, of any kind, some function of the intelligence will be nullified, corresponding to that damage. For this reason our whole and perfect Torah removed us far from anything that causes [such] a defect. In this vein, according to the plain meaning we would say we were given a ban by the Torah against all forbidden foods. And if there are some among them whose harm is known [understood] neither by us nor by the wise men of medicine, do not wonder about them; as the faithful, trustworthy Physician who adjured us about them is wiser than both you and them. And how foolish and impulsive is the one who thinks that things don't have damage or benefit, except for that which he can grasp. And you should know that their reasons were not revealed, for our benefit; lest people who hold themselves to be great sages get up and feign wisdom to say, \"X damage that the Torah stated in thing y is only in place a, whose nature is such,\" or \"with person b, whose nature is such and such,\" and lest one of the dim-witted be seduced by their words. Therefore their reason was not revealed, to aid us [avoid] this obstacle.", 
                "And it is known from the paths of medicine that the meat of all torn animals that are forbidden to us brings damage to the body of its eater, as the state of being 'torn' indicates sickness in the animal. And do not ask yourself to say, \"What damage can there be in an animal that was torn and immediately slaughtered?\" As it is not from wisdom that you would ask about this. Do you not know that there is a beginning to everything? And if you admit to me that in the course of time, the damage will be found in it due to its being in a status of being 'torn,' you will be obligated to admit that the damage begins from the first instant, except that it is small at first. Yet there is no doubt that even a little damage is bad. And also, all of the laws of the Torah and anything that has endurance must be like this, as if you place measurements on your words, nothing will ever be established in your hand.", 
                "The laws of the commandment: For example, the [types of] 'torn' animals that were [instructed] to Moshe at Sinai, and they are the eight main categories (<i>avot</i>, Chullin 54a): the clawed; the pierced; the lacking; the removed; the split; the torn; the fallen and the broken. And the clawed is the most severe of all, since it is explicit in the Torah. And hence, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 5:3) that any doubt that comes about it [renders it] forbidden. And with other 'torn' animals, there are some wherein a doubt is permissible. And each and every one of these main categories has so many derivatives, as their listings come in the Gemara. And the tally of all the 'torn' animals that it is possible to find in a domesticated animal, a wild animal or a bird that comes in our hand from their listing as it would appear from the words of the Gemara is seventy-two, with one more in the birds than the animals. And they cannot be added to and they cannot be subtracted from, since it is possible that a domesticated animal or a wild animal or a bird could survive from any wound contracted by them, except for these that the sages enumerated in the early generations and about which the Israelite courts agreed - and even [if] we know by way of medicine that its end is not to survive. And all of these wounds that they enumerated and said that they were [in the category of] 'torn' animals; even if it appears according to the ways of medicine in our hands that some of them do not kill and it is possible that it will survive it; you only have what the Sages enumerated, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 17:1), \"According to the instruction.\" And each one of the seventy two 'torn' animals that we mentioned is elucidated at length with all of its conditions in Tractate Chullin.", 
                "And a person need not search for all of these 'tearings' that the sages enumerated in animals and in birds and check them before he eats the meat of an animal or bird - since most animals are assumed to be fit (kosher), as we assume most living creatures to be healthy - except for one of them that the sages required to check before we eat the meat, because this 'tearing' is much found. And that is the 'tearing' in the lung in which mucous membranes called <i>sirkhot</i> (adhesions) are found. And there is a concern with them that they not pull the tissue of the lung and puncture it. Hence, a person must always see on which side these mucous membranes are found in the lung before he eats from the animal. And if he finds them in [such] a way that it is possible that from their movement, the lung would be punctured, it is a 'torn' animal - as we say that we consider anything that stands to be punctured regardless as punctured [already]; and it is as if it is dead, since it is impossible for it to be saved from death. And it is known that this sickness that brings these mucous membranes in places that they will puncture in the future is the beginning of a sickness that brings death, as the mucous membranes have [already] formed in those places. ", 
                "And these are the places that the mucous membranes 'tear' according to the principle that has come into our hands from the words of the Gemara with the good commentaries: Any place where there is an adhesion on the central bronchial tube is 'torn' and it is not permitted by way of examination, except in one way - if the adhesion is on the wall and there is a wound on the wall and the entire adhesion comes out of the place of the wound, as in this case we say [to] check, and some permit it without checking. And there are those (Rashi on Chullin 46b) that remove from this principle [of what is automatically 'torn'] if the adhesion is on the side of the lobe from one [end of the] division to the [other end of the] division, and so is it our custom today to permit [this]. Any time that the small pink lobe which is on the right side has an adhesion, it is 'torn.' And the lobes of the lung are five, besides the small lobe, and there are three on the right side of the lobe when the animal is suspended by its legs, according to the way the butchers suspend it, and two on the left. [But] if they have adhesions or are [connected] one to the other and the adhesion comes out from one [end of the] division to the [other end of the] division, and so [too,] if the adhesions are on the ribs of the animal among which [the lungs] crouch and the adhesion goes out from the back of the lobe to the rib and clings to the ribs and the flesh between the ribs - and all the more so [if it clings] to the flesh itself - we determine all of this to be permissible. But if the adhesion come out between them from the division of the lobe to the back of [another lobe] or from one back to [the other] back, and so [too,] if it goes out from the lobe to the ribs and only clings to the bones themselves, and so [too,] in any other place in the animal at all that the lobe has an adhesion there or is [connected], we determine it to be forbidden.", 
                "And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, removed from this principle anytime the adhesions are on the breast or the fat of the breast and determines it to be permissible (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 11:7). But this is not our custom. An adhesion that is suspended in any place, whether from the lobe or whether from the central bronchial tube, is fit (kosher). And there are those that render it 'torn,' but our custom is to permit it. If the lobes are not to be found in this order or are lacking from this sum, it is 'torn.' And the small pink lobe replaces one lack [of a lobe]. But if [even] many more than this sum are found, it is nothing - so long as the addition is not on the side of their back. As if it is on the side of their back - even one that is as small as a myrtle leaf or smaller - it is forbidden. And there are those that permit it  when it is smaller than a myrtle leaf (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Ritual Slaughter 8:4).", 
                "And the rest of the many details of this commandment are elucidated in the third chapter of Chullin. And the laws of the other prohibitions that we wrote above which are understood from the understanding of the language of the verse inside [of it] are in this same exact chapter and in the last chapter of Makkot and the first of Bekhorot. And this warning was repeated in the Prophets in the book of Ezekiel 44:31 for the priests alone, as it is written, \"Any carcass or torn animal [...] the priests shall not eat.\" And the Sages informed us (Menachot 45a) that it was repeated [specifically] for them, as Scripture commanded them to eat the bird sin-offering with <i>melikah</i> (ritual decapitation), even though it is forbidden to [other Jews] like a carcass. And maybe you would think from this that non-consecrated meat would also be permissible for them with <i>melikah</i> or an inferior slaughtering, as the Torah is not exacting with them. As since they were excluded for one thing, they would would be excluded regarding all matters of slaughter. And therefore, the prophet warned them explicitly to inform us that <i>melikah</i> alone is only permissible with a sacrifice, but with non-consecrated meat, they are still forbidden like [other Jews].", 
                "And this commandment is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females. And one who transgresses it and eats a <i>kazayit</i> of a 'torn' animal and from all of those [things] that are implied from the understanding of the verse, \"that went out of their boundaries,\" is lashed. And let it not be difficult to you [to ask,] \"And how is he lashed - it is established for us that we do not administer lashes for a negative commandment that is part of a group, and behold, this [is a negative commandment] that included several things,\" as we have said. As two greats of the generations have already elucidated it in the Book of the Commandments in the ninth principle, and they are Rambam, may his memory be blessed, and Ramban, may his memory be blessed. And there they wrote their explanations and their proofs in detail, to clarify the thing well. And the matter would be long. Therefore I have left it, as is my custom in [this] book. And nonetheless, you should know that it comes out of the words of both of them that this is not included as a negative commandment that is part of a group."

And the judge is commanded about this so that he not bring the untruths of one of them into his soul. And so does the Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 23:1 come [to tell us] that this warning of \"You shall not raise, etc.\" is said about this. And they also said there that it is also a warning to the litigant, for him too, not to make his claims to the judge not in front of his adversary, and even if the judge wants to hear it. And about this, it is also said (Exodus 23:7), \"From a false matter, distance yourself.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Makkot 23a) that this negative commandment includes telling evil speech, and accepting it, and giving false testimony.

There is nothing more disgusting than it, and malediction and curse are in the house of its lovers. [This is] because God, may He be blessed, is a truthful God, and everything that is with Him is true. And blessing is only found and resting upon those that make themselves similar to Him in their deeds: to be truthful, like He is truthful; to be merciful, like He is merciful; and to be purveyors of kindness, like He is of great kindness. But [regarding] anyone whose deeds are the opposite of His good traits and are masters of falsehood - which is exactly the opposite of His traits - the opposite of His traits will similarly always rest upon them. And the opposite of the trait of blessing which is with Him is malediction and curse; and the opposite of joy and peace and enjoyment which are with Him is worry, strife and pain. All of these are the \"evildoer’s portion from God\" (Job 20:29). And therefore the Torah warned us to distance ourselves much form falsehood, as it is written, \"From a false matter, distance yourself,\" And behold, it used an expression of distancing, due to it being very disgusting; something it did not mention in all the other warnings. And from the side of distancing, it warned us not to bend our ears at all to anything that is considered falsehood - and even if we do not know with certainly that it is a false matter. And [this is] similar to what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 44b), \"Distance yourself from what is ugly, and from what is similar to it.\" And in my saying, \"the traits of the Holy One, blessed be He,\" I am pulled after the words of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, who related to Him, may He be blessed, the name of traits according to the side of those receiving them (people).

And the elucidation of this is that when there is a disagreement among the judges about the case of a man, and some say that he is liable for the death penalty and some say that he is not liable - and those who [would] make him liable are one more than those who [would] make him innocent - that the judge should not do with the [suspected] sinner according to the words of those who make him liable, as it is stated (Exodus 23:2), \"Do not be after the many to do bad,\" meaning to say, do not go after the majority that would engender to conclude a judgment of death. And this is the expression of the Scripture, \"to do bad,\" meaning to say, to a liability for the death penalty. And that is when there is an exact majority, meaning to say that the decision is only because of one person. But if the decision is with two,  we follow their words, even 'to do bad.'

And [so] we too are commanded about this, that innocence be greater than liability in capital cases, as it is something that has no repayment. And the judgments of the commandment are in the fourth chapter of Sanhedrin, as we have written above in the positive commandment of inclining towards the many (Sefer HaChinukh 78). And one who transgresses it and makes [someone] liable with a majority decided by one, has transgressed the commandment of the King.

And if it is a case that is dependent upon a decree of scripture (<i>gezerat hakatuv</i>), a <i>gezerah shava</i> or a <i>hekesh</i> (the latter two being exegetical inferences based on similar wording in two sections), he must know it himself, and not rely and trust one of the [other] judges, nor the majority, as it is stated (Exodus 23:2), \"and you shall not answer about an argument to incline\" - meaning to say, do not say something about an argument to incline, meaning only from the side of leaning towards the words of a great judge or towards the majority, and not from the side of your understanding. Or if you want to be silent from [saying] that which is in your heart about the case and [instead] to incline after their words, do not do so. And the language of the Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 23:2 is \"'You shall not answer about an argument to incline' - that you not say, 'It is enough for me that I be like Rabbi x,' but rather, say what is in your heart. Maybe, monetary cases are also like this? Hence the verse teaches, 'to lean after the majority.'\" And within this very negative commandment is included that the one who advocates innocence in capital cases not go back and advocate guilt, as it stated, \"and you shall not answer about an argument to incline,\" meaning to say, \"let not your words be  inclined towards guilt\" (Sanhedrin 34a). And so, too, included is that we do not open towards guilt in capital case. And the explanation then comes, \"and you shall not answer about an argument to incline,\" meaning to say, the opening of your words should not be for guilt. As per force, we must explain it about the beginning of the case, since it is impossible to say that it warns that you not answer guilt about about the whole case. As, if so, no man would ever be prosecuted.  ",

And since God knew that the people that received the Torah. in their acting in the way that they were commanded by it, would be prepared for wisdom and understanding and would understand what they need to about the functioning of the world in it, kept the things implicit in [various] places and gave over the explanation through the great intermediary between them and Him. And [so] He did not give it with longer words, as all of its words are decreed and obligatory in their count and form, to be like they are. As besides the understanding of its precious commandments that we understand in them, great and majestic wisdom is included in it - to the point that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, exalted the wisdom that God, blessed be He, placed in it, such that they said about it (Bereshit Rabbah 1) that the Holy One, blessed be He, looked into it and created the world.",

He would nonetheless seek any way he can to exempt him according to the law.

Rather, [since] she was a wise woman and a prophetess, they would give and take with her, even about matters of the prohibited and the permitted and also civil laws.

But according to the opinion of some commentators, they are fit to judge. And they said that it is an open verse [that proves this], as it is stated, \"and she judged.\" And [about] that which they said in Sanhedrin 34b that anyone who is not fit to testify is not fit to judge - and women are certainly not fit to testify, as is proven there - it is possible that they would say, according to their opinion that this is [not an issue], since we do not learn from general principles (Eruvin 27a).

But with approximately equal wisdom, the Torah informed us that the many opinions will always conform to the truth more than the minority. But whether - according to the opinion of the listener - they agree to the truth or they do not agree to the truth, logic dictates that we do not swerve from the path of the majority. And that which I say that the choice of the majority is always with two groups that disagree that are equal in the wisdom of truth is said so about every place except for the Sanhedrin. As with them, we are not exacting when they disagree as to which group knows more, but rather we always do like the words of their majority.

And even if the sages sometimes do not reach [come to] the truth - God forbid - the sin will be upon them and not upon us.

However, God, blessed be He, is not indebted to any man, nor jealous of any man. As it is in His hand to reverse them all - together with the rest of the world - to null and void, by resting His will on nullification; in the same way that He created them by resting his Will on creation. [Rather], God, blessed be He, is referred to as jealous, by way of the deeds of men: as there is no greater hatred among them than one who is jealous of a man about any thing, or one who is jealous about his wife for her licentiousness with others. And hence, these comparisons were written in the Torah about Him, Blessed be He, in order that they should enter the ears of the hearer (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 4).",

And [just] like it was His desire to send a prophet to people to teach them the path in which they should walk and [so] merit to preserve their souls, so too did He desire, in His great kindnesses, to fix a place on earth for them that would be prepared for the good of people and their merit - and all of this is from His kindnesses to His creatures.

And, if so, the heart of a person will not be properly purified only with the word of the lips, that he say between himself and the wall, \"I have sinned, I will not [do it] again.\" But when he does a great act for his sin, to take 'he-goats from his pens' and to exert himself  to bring them to the prepared house to the priest, and [do] all of the procedure that it written about the sacrifices of the sinners - from all of this great action - he will fix the badness of sin in his soul, and it will be avoided by him the [next] time.",

And the limbs [of the sacrifice] correspond to the hands and feet of a person that does all of his work. And he sprinkles the blood on the altar corresponding to the blood of his soul, so that a person think in doing all of this that he sinned to God with his body and his soul, and it is fit for him that his blood be spilled and his body burnt; were it not for the kindness of the Creator, who took an exchange and ransom from him [in] the sacrifice - that its blood be instead of his blood and its soul be instead of his soul. And the central limbs correspond to his central limbs. And the portions with which to sustain the teachers of Torah [are so] that they will pray for him. And the daily sacrifice is because there is no saving the community from always sinning. And these words are tenable [and] grab the heart, like the words of classic homiletic teachings (Shabbat 87a). To here [are his words]. And he wrote at more length about the matter and wrote, \"And in the way of truth (mysticism), the sacrifices contain a hidden secret, etc.,\" as he wrote in his commentary on Parshat Vaykra.  ", 
                "And we will add other things on the [level] of the simple meaning, and say that it is from this root that God commanded us to always sacrifice from things about which the heart of man covets, like meat and wine and bread, so that the heart be more aroused with this matter. And it [likewise] obligated the poor person to bring from his little [supply] of flour that his eyes and heart are upon all of the day. And there is another arousal of the heart with animal sacrifices from the angle of similarity, as human and animal bodies are similar in all of their matters - they are only differentiated that in this one, intellect was given into it, and not into that one. And when the human body goes out of the realm of the intellect at the time of the sin, he must know that he has entered the realm of animals at that time, as this is the only thing that differentiates them. And therefore he is commanded to take a body of flesh like him and to bring it to the place chosen for the raising of the intellect and to burn it there, and to forget its memory - it shall be completely [incinerated], 'it shall not be remembered and it shall not be thought of,' corresponding to his body - in order to form a strong image in his heart that any matter of a body without intellect is lost and completely null. And he should [thus] rejoice in his portion of an intelligent soul with which God has graced him, [and] which exists forever. And the body that cooperates with it will also exist in the revival [of the dead] on its account, in its following its counsel, meaning to say in its guarding itself from sin. And in his fixing this image in his soul, he will be very careful about sin. And the Torah promises that through this great act and through the obedience of its doer that he regret his sin from his heart and from his soul, [that] his accidental sin will be atoned. But this similarity will not suffice to atone for volitional sins, as one who sins volitionally will not be chastised by similarities and words, but only by \"the rod for the back of fools\" (Proverbs 26:3).", 
                "And let it not be difficult to you in putting down this reason, how it is that we would ever bring a voluntary offering, as our reason also [explains] voluntary offerings: Since we have said that a sacrifice is an illustration of the lowering of bodies and the elevation of soul, the sacrificer will find benefit to [learn this] lesson, even without a known sin.", 
                "And about the sacrifice of Azazel that would be sent alive to a place of destruction and of extinction, we will say about the simple understanding of the matter [as follows]: The complete sinner should not imagine that after his soul receive the punishment for [the] sins, it will return to stand in the place of the good or [that] there will be some survival and good, even if he is like Yerovam the son of Nevat and his colleagues; just like he sees the whole entire year that the body of the animal that is an illustration for the body of the sinner has some remnants in the House of God, may He be blessed, in the ashes that stay there at the time of the burning - they do not take them out from the Temple until after much time. Therefore in [this] living goat that carries all of the sins, they will see a hint that a sinner whose sins are great - like the heretics and those that deny Torah or the revival of the dead, and all of those that oppose Israel are included [as well] - will never see any good, and 'their worm will never die and their fire will never be extinguished.' [It is] like the procedure of this goat, [that] in his carrying the multitude of sins of all of Israel, is sent completely to a desolate land - he is not found in the House of God, not for slaughter and not for sprinkling - 'its memory will be lost from the earth.' And this is [the meaning of] what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Talmud Yerushalmi Yoma 6:3) that at the time that Israel was accepted, it would not reach halfway [down] the mountain before it would become [detached,] limb [from] limb - to show them the illustration of a compete sinner. As so will he be quickly destroyed, and he will be entirely, completely destroyed. [This is] in order that they would learn and [understand] the lesson and improve their ways. And this sign is good for them, as only he who loves one teaches him lessons, as it is written (Proverbs 13:24), \"but he who loves him disciplines him early.\"", 
                "And regarding the division of the sacrifices in their slaughtering and the giving of the blood and the portion of the priests and the rest of its many details, were we to say that the thought of the servant [making the sacrifice] be directed to the [parts of the] multitudinous service - as the distinctions would require the direction of thought to the matter - the only thing that would come up in our hands would be the words of youths. And the principle of the thing is that even in the simple understandings, we cannot find our hand or feet without the support of the mystics (kabbalists). And we bow our heads to them and they should open our eyes about all of this.", 
                "However we should not be called from the group of fools, in our spending all of our breath on [empty] words; as in much waste, a little food can sometimes be found. Also because we have seen our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, saying [words] similar to our words: As they said about the sacrifice of a <i>sotah</i> (a suspect of adultery) (Sotah 14a), \"She did an animal act, therefore she should bring barley (animal food)\"; and with the sacrifice of a <i>metsora</i> (Vayikra Rabbah 16, Arakhin 16b), \"He did an act of chatter, he should bring birds.\" And similar to this, they, may their memory be blessed, said regarding the matter of a menstruant woman, \"Why did the Torah say that she sit seven clean days? That she be most dear to him.\" And in truth, none of all this is in their opinion the ultimate intent of the things. Rather, it is to inform that the matter of the commandment includes many hints, besides the great and strong fundamentals. ", 
                "From the laws of the commandment – what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Zevachim 112b) that before the Temple was built in Jerusalem, they would sacrifice in other places, but from when the Temple was built, all of the places were forbidden to build a house for the sake of God and to sacrifice there, as it is stated (Psalms 132:14), \"This is the place of My resting forever and ever\";[that] these are the things that are the main part of the building of the Temple, we make a Holy and a Holy of Holies there, and in front of the Holy is another place and it is called the chamber, and the three of them are called the sanctuary (Mishnah Middot 4:6), and we make a partition around the sanctuary distant from it, like the curtains of the courtyard that were in the wilderness, and everything that is encircled by this partition, which is like the courtyard of the tent of meeting is called the yard, and the whole thing is called the Temple (<i>mikdash</i>); that we make the vessels in the Temple that are written in the Torah that we need there; that which they said (Zevachim 88a) that we immediately melt down all holy vessels that become pierced or cracked and make new ones; [that] we do not fix a knife, the blade of which is detached or dented, but rather bury it immediately, as there is no poverty in a place of wealth; [that] we make boundaries in the yard, up until here for Israel, up until here for the priests; [that] close to it, we build enclosures to use for all the needs of the Temple, and each one is called a compartment; and the rest of its details, such as how was the building of the Temple, its form, all of its measurements, the building of the altar and its ordinances – are [all] elucidated in Tractate Middot.

As the understanding of 'practiced throughout the generations' is not that the doing of that commandment never cease from Israel ever at any time. Rather the matter is like this: Any commandment that was only commanded to do at a specific time and not more - such as that which is written (Exodus 19:15), \"Be in preparation for three days\"; and so [too,] the warning of Sinai (Exodus 34:3), \"neither shall the flocks and the herds graze across from that mountain,\" and all that is similar to it, wherein the command was only temporary - those are called commandments that are not practiced throughout the generations. But any commandment that we were not commanded about [only] for a specific time - even though there is a pause at any given time because of our exile or by reason of something else, such as now when, on account of our sins, we do not have the ark - is called a commandment practiced throughout the generations. As any time that we have the ark, we are obligated not to remove its poles from it, so that the Levites [may] take it out with them if we need to bring it from one place to another place as a result of war or from whatever reason that [may] arise.",

And [so], we have been commanded all glory and all majesty towards it, to all of our ability. Therefore, we were commanded not to remove the poles of the ark from it, lest we need to go out with the ark to any place quickly, and maybe due to the preoccupation and the rush, we will not check well that its poles are strong enough; and lest, God forbid, it will fall from their hands, and this is not [fit for] its glory. But with their always being ready and not being removed from it, we will make them very strong, and [so] there will not be a mishap with them.

                "It is from the roots of this commandment that God, blessed be He, commanded us the constant commandment of the bread, on account that through it a man lives; and as a result, [the commandment] is needed by him for blessing to always be found in [his bread]. And from our involvement in it to fulfill the commandment of God, may He be blessed, the [Divine] will and blessing will descend upon us, and that which is similar to it will be blessed. And according to each and every matter upon which he places the conglomeration of his focus, his thoughts and his activities by way of a commandment - according to them, a similar blessing will emerge upon him. And so I have found [in] Ramban (Ramban on Exodus 25:24). And [it] is like the matter that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Rosh HaShanah 16:1), \"Bring the <i>omer</i> (barley offering) in front of Me at Pesach, in order that the grain in the fields will be blessed for you; pour the water in front of Me on the Festival (Sukkot), in order that the rains of blessing will be blessed for you in the coming year; blow the ram's horn (shofar) in front of Me, in order to remember the binding of Yitzchak.\" And they said about this very same bread (Megillah 26b) that because it is an accessory of the commandment, and through it the will of God is done, blessing would cling to it more. And [so] each one of the priests who had from it coming to him would be twice as satiated. ", 
                "We were commanded in all of these things, such as the table, the menorah, the bread of display and the sacrifices, from the angle of the receivers (people), and like the matter that I wrote. There is no doubt or qualm to anyone who understands, or student that is not lacking in comprehension in the world who would think that with the arrangement of bread in the Temple upon the table, which we place  complete and we take [away] complete, that there is any benefit (enjoyment) accrued by the Above, God forbid - not in its appearance, not in its smell and not from any angle. Rather, He commanded us like this in His desire, blessed be He, that we be blessed from Him, in His great trait of kindness. And [this is] also [true about] the frankincense that comes with the bread, about which it is written, \"a burnt offering to the Lord.\" And [when] some of the commentators (Rashi on Leviticus 24:7) said that there is nothing from the bread that is for the Above except for the frankincense, their intention was not, God forbid, that there be any distinction between the frankincense and the bread for the Above. And the fulfillment of the commandment of God is the same with the bread and the frankincense: As just like God, blessed be He, commanded to arrange the bread in front of Him, so too is His will done, with the frankincense that He commanded to burn, and they burned it - one standard for all. Rather, all of these matters were written from the angle of those involved [in them]; as it cannot be written about the bread that we feed the priests, that it is all for God - as others have a portion in it. But with anything that man does not have any benefit in it at all, and it is completely consumed in the commandment; with that we can say about it that it is completely for God. [That] means to say that all of it is included in the commandment - no man ate from it, nor enjoyed any physical benefit from it at all. And since smell is not from the pleasures of the body, but rather from the pleasures of the spirit - as the body only receives tangible pleasure - the matter of smell is always attributed to God, blessed be He. [This is] even though He, blessed be He and blessed be His name, is not - due to His supernal level and His greatness - connected to these matters at all, as He is not a body, and not the attribute of a body. This is known to all that understand. And they, may their memory be blessed, already explained (Rashi on Zevachim 46b, s.v. pleasantness of smell) [that] every place that it is stated, \"a pleasant smell to the Lord\" (for example, Leviticus 1:9), [it means] \"I said something, and My will was done.\" And so [too,] \"And the Lord smelled the pleasant smell\" (Genesis 8:21), [should be understood] in this way. This is what appears [correct] to us regarding the matter of the arranging of the bread in the House of God. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Guide for the Perplexed 3:45), and this is his language: But I do not know a reason for the table and the bread always being put upon it; and to this day, I do not know to what thing to ascribe it.",

But it does not [carry] lashes of rebellion for less than a <i>revi’it</i>. And nonetheless even the smallest amount is rabbinically forbidden to benefit from. And regarding other things in the world besides wine, they, may their memory be blessed, were not stringent to forbid everything found in their hand undifferentiated, out of the concern of sacrifices to idol worship or the concern [that it is] itself idolatry, besides with things that are [specifically] made for it - for example, that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Avodah Zarah 41a) regarding idols, that undifferentiated idols are made for idol worship. And therefore, they forbade them. And even one who finds them discarded is not allowed to take them without well-known conditions, as they, may their memory be blessed, explained (Avodah Zarah 41a). And so [too,] is it certainly with anything that an Israelite thinks was made as a sacrifice, that it is forbidden to take of them.", 
                "And they also made many distancings about the matter of wine, as it was the main [source] for the joy of the offering; and also since the Torah mentioned its prohibition explicitly, as it is written in Parshat Haazinu (Deuteronomy 32:38), \"drank the wine of their libations.\" And hence they, may their memory be blessed, were stringent and said (Avodah Zarah 58a) in order to distance the matter that even the wine of a Jew when it is touched by a gentile is immediately prohibited, even to benefit from it. And do not let it be difficult to you, how is it that a gentile can forbid the wine of an Israelite, since we have it established that a person can not bring a prohibition to something that is not his (Chullin 40b). As this is not said except in a case such as if he bows down to his friend's animal, where he did not do an act to the body of the thing. But anytime he does an act to the body of the thing - and even a minor act, like this of touching - he has the power to forbid a thing that is not his, rabbinically. However it is not [forbidden] by Torah writ until he does a major act, such as slaughtering his animal, which is a major act; and so [too,] if he poured wine in front of the actual idol, that is also a major act. But regarding touching the wine not in front of the idol, it is a minor act. And since it is minor and the prohibition is only rabbinic, they, may their memory be blessed, permitted  (Avodah Zarah 59b) one to take repayment from the one who made it forbidden for that which he made forbidden. And even though they were stringent about the body of the thing to forbid its benefit, they were not stringent about its payment; as payment [here] is only a type of repayment for damage. And [so] he does not benefit from the forbidden thing, but rather takes payment for his damage from the one who made it forbidden.", 
                "And so [too,] were they, may their memory be blessed, very strict in the distancing of wine that has been libated in front of an actual idol or about any thing of idolatry more than with any other prohibitions in the Torah. As you don't have anything [else] in all of the Torah the benefit of which is forbidden, that when it is mixed with something permissible and it is not recognizable, does not have a remedy, [so] as to benefit [from what was permissible] - even something wet in something wet - with that which Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said in the Gemara (Avodah Zarah 74a), that he should sell it all to gentiles except for the value of the prohibited matter in it; and that is when it is from the things that are not purchased [by Jews] from a gentile, so that no Israelite man will stumble through them and purchase it from the gentile. But with true wine libations and with all idolatrous things, they do not have the remedy of selling it all to the gentile, etc. And, all the more so, do they not have the remedy of taking [its] benefit to the Dead Sea. However, [it is] only when true wine libations were mixed - and even one drop of it - that there is no remedy for its benefit ever. But if a barrel of it got mixed with other barrels of kosher wine - since the actual body of the prohibition did not mix, but rather each [barrel] stands on its own - it has a remedy with the remedy of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, that he sell all of it to the gentiles, etc. And so [too,] with their undifferentiated wine, they have a remedy with the remedy of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, even when they actually got mixed, like the law of other prohibitions, as it is not fully wine libations. ", 
                "And you must also know that [in] all of the prohibitions of the Torah, the mixture of which is forbidden to benefit from, it is only forbidden if there is enough of the forbidden food mixed into the permissible food to give off taste into the permissible food - unless that forbidden food is an important thing. As any important thing, such as a portion [with which it] is fit to honor [others] and similar to it, is forbidden in the smallest amount. But anything that is not an important thing does not forbid a mixture unless there is enough in it to give off taste; except for, wine libations and all matters of idolatry which forbid in the smallest amount, to benefit from everything that is mixed with them (Avodah Zarah 73a), as we said. And there is nothing else in the world at all that is an exception to this principle except for forbidden mixtures of the vineyard (and <i>orlah</i>, the fruit of trees for the first three years), and chamets on Pesach, according to the opinion of some commentators who forbid their mixture of one in two hundred - whether in its own type [of food] or whether not in its type - and (tithes) (<i>orlah</i>) [a burnt offering] with [a mixture] of one in a hundred. And regarding the matter of the remedy that they have, we have already said that there is the remedy of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel for all of the prohibitions, except for all of the prohibitions of idolatry wherein the prohibited object was itself actually added. As there is no remedy for it ever, and this is from the stringency of idolatry. 'And turn and turn in' the Gemara, as you will find all of this elucidated with the good commentaries. And hold on to [these] things, as you will need them in many places in the Talmud. Hence, I wrote at length about them, which is not like my custom in these annals.", 
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, further distanced us from the prohibition of wine libations, saying that even the payment for wine libations is prohibited to benefit from (Avodah Zarah 62a). They also stressed its distancing by saying that [perhaps] the payment of one who is paid to break barrels of wine libations should be prohibited, because he desires its existence for a short time; meaning to say that he wants that the wine should be preserved in the barrels until he breaks them, so that he will gain his payment for breaking them. As they, may their memory be blessed, wanted to uproot [it] from our thoughts that we should not want its preservation for even one moment, due to our great disgust with all types of idolatry. And the answer [to their query] was, let him break it and a blessing will come to him, as he diminished the idiocy.", 
                "And the rest of its many details - for example, who is it that makes [wine into] wine libations to render it prohibited even to benefit from, and who is it that renders it prohibited only for drinking; from when does it become a wine libation; the law of the gentile's intentional and unintentional touch; his propulsion and the propulsion of that propulsion, and if the Jew is aiding him; which guarding will suffice for us with our wine in the house of the gentile or in our house if there is a gentile there or a carriage and he left a gentile there, such as coming in and out, such that the wine will be permissible; the prohibition that we have with the vessels of their wine, and the law of how to make it fit (kosher); the many details that come to us also about the vessels of their cooking and that is the matter called, \"expurgations [of the vessels] of the gentiles\"; the laws of our distancing that we not defile our souls also in the matters that are extensions of these disgusting things, such as that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Makkot 16b) not to eat and drink in disgusting vessels such as urinals, vessels for feces and a blood-letting horn, since the soul is disgusted in the matter; and the rest of its details - are elucidated in the last chapters of Avodah Zarah, and some of them are in Chullin.", 
                "And this warning is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females. And one who transgresses it and eats the smallest amount or drinks even a drop of true wine libation is lashed. As the law of these things is not like the law of other laws of prohibited foods, which are with a <i>kazayit</i> and the law of drinking [which] is with a <i>reviit</i>; since the Torah warned about idolatry   and stated (Deuteronomy 13:18), \"Nothing is to cling to your hand from the anathema,\" meaning to say even the smallest amount.", 
                "In this prevention of wine libations, both Rambam (in Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 194), may his memory be blessed, and Ramban (in his gloss to the Sefer HaMitzvot), may his memory be blessed, conceded that there is a negative commandment in this, and that it is counted in the tally of the negative commandments. However they did disagree about it in the [following] matter: that Rambam extracts the prohibition of wine libations from the verse that is written in Parshat Haazinu (Deuteronomy 32:38), \"drank the wine of their libations,\" and the prohibition of other gifts to idolatry from, \"Nothing is to cling to your hand from the anathema\"(Deuteronomy 13:18) and from \"You shall not bring an abomination\" (Deuteronomy 7:26); [whereas] Ramban, may his memory be blessed, wrote that we learn the prohibition of all of the gifts of idolatry from this verse of \"Guard yourself,\" and wine libations are included. And I have written this verse, like his opinion, not like my custom in all of the book -  as I have written all [of the other verses] according to the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed. But in this [case] I saw that this verse is very fit to expound the matter from it; and also that there is a warning in it. And [it is] as they, may their memory be blessed, said (Eruvin 96a), [that] every place where it states, \"guard yourself,\" or \"lest\" or \"do not,\" it is nothing but a negative commandment. However in the verse, \"drank the wine of their libations,\" there is no warning. And I also saw great ones from the enumerators of the commandment that wrote like this. "

And let it not be difficult to you, [that] if so, why is its prohibition not stated explicitly, as \"you shall not eat,\" and expressed with an expression of cooking. As the answer to this [is] because there is a novelty in the prohibition of its eating above the eating of the other prohibitions. As with other prohibitions, the liability is only if he enjoys his eating. But here even if the does not enjoy his eating, once he swallows it - and even if he swallows it hot and he burns his throat with it, and similar to it - he is lashed nonetheless. [It is] as they, may their memory be blessed, said in Pesachim 25a, \"For this reason did [the Torah] not write, 'eating' in [the verse] itself: To say that one is lashed [even when consumed] not in the way of its enjoyment.\" And nonetheless, we do not administer lashes for it unless it is by way of cooking (Chullin 108a), according to the language that the verse expressed its prohibition.", 
                "And even though they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 115b) that that which the prohibition of cooking is written three times in the Torah is to teach the prohibition of eating, the prohibition of cooking and the prohibition of benefiting - it is only fit for us to count two [of them] in the tally of negative commandments; as the prohibition of eating and benefiting are one thing. [It is] like they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 115b), \"Every place that it is stated, 'You (singular) shall not eat,' 'You (plural) shall not eat,' both the prohibition of eating and the prohibition of benefiting are implied.\" As the Torah expresses all of the enjoyments more generally with an expression of eating, since it is a constant enjoyment for a person, and he needs it; and like the matter that is written (Exodus 24:11), \"they beheld God, and they ate and drank\" - that it calls enjoyment 'eating.'   ", 
                "And if you will grab me [and say], \"If so, why are three prohibitions written?\" As two suffice, according to what I have said. [Then] one can answer you that certainly if in [one] place it was written, \"You shall not cook,\" to teach about the prohibition of cooking and in another place, \"You shall not eat,\" which would include the prohibition of benefiting and the prohibition of eating, as we have said - it would have been correct not to write the third. As there would not be any need it in, since we would have already learned eating and benefiting from \"You shall not eat\" - from the principle in our hand, that included in eating is the implication about benefiting. But now that eating is not mentioned in any place, we would not have learned [about] benefiting without the third negative [statement]. And you should not ask further, \"And why did the [Torah] not write, 'You shall not eat' in one of them and it would suffice with two?\" As I have informed you that it was for a purpose that Scripture did not mention it with the expression of eating, as the liability for it is even if it is not in the way of its enjoyment. We have learned from here that the intention of that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 115b) \"One is for the prohibition of eating, one is for the prohibition of benefiting and one is for the prohibition of cooking,\" is not that the third verse be a [separate] negative commandment, but rather that we need to learn from it about benefiting. And blessed be [the One] Who chose their words.",

                "From the laws of the commandment: That which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 113a), that the prohibition of meat with milk from Torah writ is only with meat of a beast (domesticated animal) that is pure (kosher); but not from an impure beast, not from a [wild] animal - even a pure [one] - and not from a bird, whether pure or impure. And they relied for this upon that which it is written, \"kid\" three times in the Torah, which is an expression of exclusion, as it should have [otherwise] written, \"meat.\" And the explanation about this came (Chullin 113a), \"'A kid' and not an impure beast, 'a kid' and not a [wild] animal, 'a kid' and not a bird.\" And therefore, they, may their memory be blessed, said that it is permitted to cook these three with milk, and they are permitted in benefit. But they, may their memory be blessed, prohibited them in eating to make a fence for the meat of a beast, which is forbidden by Torah writ, so that people do not switch [one] meat for [another] meat. And hence since the thing is [plausible] that [one] meat will be switched with [another] meat, they were also stringent with this fence, exactly like they were with the meat of beast in some matters, such that they forbade that they be brought up [together] on a table at all. And according to the opinion of some commentators, they obligated about them that there be a pause between their eating and the eating of cheese, like with the main prohibition, which is the meat of a beast. But with the meat of fish and locusts, they did not make a fence with them all, as their meat is not at all similar to the meat of a beast, and people will not come to err in this.", 
                "And they were also stringent in this matter according to some of the commentators to [deduce] a novel prohibition in this, more than in other prohibitions of food (Chullin 108a). [It is] in that with the matter of meat with milk, if milk is mixed with meat, and there is not sixty parts in the piece of meat corresponding to the milk, we see both of them as one piece of prohibited food. And if this piece fell into a stew of meat or a stew of milk, we measure against all of [the piece]. And this is what, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 108a) \"The piece itself becomes a carcass.\" And the reason is because their mixture is what makes them prohibited. And hence, after they have mixed, behold, they are like a piece of carcass. And with other prohibitions, it is not such; as [with] prohibited food that is mixed with a piece of permissible food and there is not sixty parts in the permissible food to nullify the prohibited food, and afterwards they fall into a stew, we only measure according to the measurement of the prohibited food that fell into it, and [the permissible portion of the piece] itself helps to [count against] the prohibited food. [This is] because that piece does not become a carcass, and [so] the permissible food in it is found to be like the rest of the permissible food in the stew - and [so] it assists [in counting against] the prohibited food. However if it is recognizable, the piece itself is forbidden forever, according to the opinion of some of the commentators.", 
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Temurah 33a) that the ashes of meat [that was cooked together] with milk is prohibited; like the ashes of all things that are prohibited to benefit from, which require burial. And they also said (Chullin 111b) that the Torah only prohibited meat with milk, regarding the milk of a living beast. But with the milk of a dead [one], it is not prohibited . And therefore the udder is permitted [to be eaten] with its milk, according to Torah writ. However the sages forbade it as a fence, until one removes its milk from it, as is elucidated in its place (Chullin 109b). And there are two dispensations for milk that is found in the stomach [of an animal]: one, that it is included in [the category of] the milk of a dead [one]; and also since it is only like refuse more generally - as it has already been digested there. And therefore it is permissible, a priori. And it is not necessary to say that that which is found coagulated there is permissible - as it is certainly like refuse - but even that which is liquid was permitted by the Geonim. One who cooks an embryo in milk is liable, and so [too,] one who eats it. But one who cooks a placenta or skin or tendons or bones or the roots of the horns or hoof nails is exempted.

And the same is true for the other death penalties. And it is [correct] for us to expound this thing from [this verse]; as behold, it is not necessary for itself, as behold, it is already written in another place, \"you shall not do work\" (Exodus 20:10) - and kindling is for the sake of work. Rather, it is written to teach [another] matter. And they explained about it that it came to teach us this [matter] that we said. And this is the language of the Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 35:3:2 (at the beginning of Parshat Vayakhel): \"'You shall not kindle fire' - burning was in the general category [of forbidden work], yet it was [specified, in order] to teach that just like burning is particular in that it is one of the death penalties of the court and [we see here] that it does not push off the Shabbat, so too all of the other death penalties do not push off the Shabbat.\" And even  with all that we have learned in this verse, it should also be expounded [for] that which they also expounded on it (Yevamot 6b), \"Kindling was [specified] to separate\" - meaning to say that one who does many principle categories of work at one time in one forgetful spell would be liable a sin-offering for each and every [type of] work by itself. And in the Gemara of the Westerners they said (Talmud Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 4:6), \"'In all of your settlements' - Rabbi Ila said in the name of Rabbi Yannai, 'From here [we learn] about courts, that they should not judge on Shabbat.'\"",

And our sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Ketuvot 46a) about the meaning of <i>rachil</i>, <i>rach la'zeh ve kashe la'zeh</i> (soft to this one and hard to that one). A different explanation: Do not be like a <i>rochel</i> (peddler), who picks up things and goes [with them to others].  ", 
                "From the roots of the commandment are that God in His goodness desires the good of the creatures that He created, and commanded them in this so that there will be peace among us, since talebearing leads to quarrel and strife.", 
                "The details of the commandment and the great amount of warnings that they, may their memory be blessed, warned us about talebearing and about its partner - evil speech - are explained in scattered locations in the Talmud and in the Midrash (Mishneh Torah, Human Dispositions 7). And they explicitly said about evil speech (Arakhin 15b), that it kills its speaker and its receiver (listener), (and) that it is said about it, \"and the receiver more than all of them [does it kill].\" And they warned much about it  to the point that they said (Bava Metzia 59b), \"One who has someone who was hung in his [family] record, let him not say, 'Hang me a fish [on the grill].'\" And they said, (Arakhin 16a), \"Within the category of 'the dust of (adjunct)' evil speech is one who praises his friend in front of [his friend's] hater, as it is stated (Proverbs 27:14), 'He who blesses his friend, etc.'\" ", 
                "And [this commandment] is practiced in every place and at every time, by males and females. And one who transgresses it and has talebearing on his tongue, transgresses a negative commandment and violates a commandment of the King. And there are no lashes, because it is a negative commandment that is lacking an action - but [nonetheless] there are several agents to the Omnipresent to give lashes besides a whip of a calf [skin] or a cows [skin]. And even though this negative commandment does not have lashes because it is lacking an action, there are times that it even has a death penalty, as is known in the law of the informer. And this law the sages permitted to do outside of the land [of Israel] for the improvement of the world: it is better that one man die and not damage and destroy the bodies - or even the property - of the many."

Perhaps you will say, \"How can we know if this maid has thought lustfully about another man?\"  The response is that for as long as the thought has not been actualized is does not disqualify her, but anytime she had cohabited she is disqualified. Even though Those of Blessed Memory said, \"when she matures she is prohibited,\" the idea is that once she has matured so much her thoughts are pure evil, and perhaps she lusted after another, and since she is an adult her evil thoughts count as a deed."

The blemish refered to in this context is permanent, as is explained in the Sifra (Emor 3:5), \"'Who has a blemish shall not serve' only includes a permanent blemish, how do we know to include a transient blemish?

In the opposite case, a person who is of low form and unusual appearance will seem unworthy in the eyes of his beholders if his actions are any less than perfect.

Aside from this, it is possible that in his perfect form there is a hint to certain concepts, for as a person contemplates[the perfect form] he will purify his soul and elevate it.  Therefor it is improper for there to be anything unusual in any form in him, lest the soul of the contemplative be scattered due to the anomaly, for it would then be moved from the purpose.", 
                "The laws of the mitzvah:  What Those of Blessed Memory (TBM) said (Talmud, Bechorot 43a), that there are three kinds of blemishes.  Some blemishes disqualify a priest from performing the service, and if similar blemishes were to be found on an animal, the animal would be ineligible to be offered as a sacrifice.   Some other blemishes disqualify a person from the service but do not disqualify an animal as a sacrifice.  And some other blemishes disqualify neither a man nor an animal, and our only concern is the perception of a blemish.  Any priest that shows any of these blemishes may not serve.  Only external blemishes disqualify a person, but blemishes that are inside of his body, like a missing kidney or spleen, or a punctured intestine, even though they render him terminally ill, his service is still valid.  This is because of the verse, \"a broken leg or hand\" just as those are external, so too must all disqualifying blemishes be external.  The Sages enumerated (Rambam, Laws of Biat Mikdash 7:8) 50 blemishes that disqualify both people and animals, 23 that are unique to animals, for a total of 73 in animals.  There are also 90 blemishes that are unique to people, for a total of 143 blemishes in people.  The categories of the 90 that are unique to people are as follow: eight in the head; two in the neck; four in the ears; five in the  shoulders; four in the eye lids; eleven in the eyes; six in the nose; three in the lips; three in the abdomen; three in the back; six in the hands; four in the genitals; fifteen in the thighs and legs; four in the general form of the body; eight in the skin tone.  Four more significant blemishes apply to people that are not external, and these are: deaf-mute; mental retardation; malnutrition (even temporary); and a person who produces a foul odor (even if the timing is predictable).  In addition to these there are two more that present problems of public perception, and these are: One whose eyelashes have fallen off, even though a meaningful amount remains at the root, and one who removed his teeth.",

Ribs are not considered viewable bones.  There are three more: an old individual who shakes when standing; a sick one who trembles because of weakness (though terminal illness is only a disqualifier of animals, as is birth by Caesarian); a repulsive one.  That totals fifty.  More details are found in the seventh chapter of Tractate Bechorot.",

If the blemish was one that is only perceived as problematic he is not flogged and his service is valid."

What is also called a gift?

Also, a rebellious wife may eat, and any wife of a priest may eat, even if she is only three years and one day old.  Also, the betrothed bride of a priest would have been eligible to eat, but the Sages decreed that she may not until they are fully married, as is explained in the beginning of the fifth chapter of Ketubot (Talmud Ketubot 57b).  A Hebrew servant does not eat, because the Torah forbids both the perennial worker and the annual worker, as it is written, \"The boarder of a priest and his worker may not eat the sacred\" (Leviticus 22:10).  But a non-Jewish slave does eat, because he is his acquired property.  Also, if the slave acquires other slaves they may eat because of his rights. This is because implicit in the expression, \"when he acquires with an acquisition\" (Leviticus 22:11), that the acquired is acquiring.  If, however, the second-tier slave acquires a third-tier slave, that slave may not eat, because it is 'when the soul acquires,' the Torah allows only one level of acquisition.  Any priestess who had relations with someone who disqualifies from the priesthood is permanently forbidden from eating teruma (Talmud, Yebamot 65a).  The same is true for an androgynous priest, whether the androgynous individual filled the role of the male or the female in the relations.  Even a strecher, that is a person who stretched his foreskin so that he would appear uncircumcised is rabinically proscribed from eating until he receives a second circumcision (Talmud, Yebamot 72a).

In the present time the prohibition applies rabbinically to produce that is grown in Israel, as we will write there.

For them His concern is for the species as a whole, and we are therefore forbidden from destroying the tree and its offshoots at once, to hint to this.  We can also explain simply that this inspires compassion within us and distances us from cruelty (which is a bad trait).

The times are: the eve of the lat day of Sukkot; the eve of the first day of Passover; the eve of Shavuot; and the eve of Rosh HaShanna.  According to rabbi Yosi HaGalili the same applies to the even of Yom Kippur in the Galil.  The obligation to inform rests exclusively on the seller; the buyer need not ask because there is a double doubt.  He does not know if the animal's mother is still living, and even if it is, he does not know if it was sold for slaughter;  They also said (Talmud, Chullin 82a) that if two people buy an animal and its offspring the one who made the first purchase has first rights to slaughter, but if the second broke the rule and did slaughter first, the first one may still not slaughter.  There is also the law of slaughtering a cow and two of her offspring or two offspring and then the cow, and the law of slaughtering her and her 'daughter' and her 'granddaughter'.  It is permitted to slaughter the 'grandmother' and 'granddaughter', because the Torah only forbids \"it and its offspring.\"",

                "They also said (Talmud, Chullin 78b) that the prohibition only applies to mother animals because the Torah says 'its offspring', meaning the one who the offspring is attached to, and that is the mother.  Neverhteless, the Talmud concludes (Talmud, Chullin 79a, according to the proper understanding) that if we conclusively know that this is the father it may not be slaughtered on the same day as the offspring, because the law follows Rabbi Yehuda.  Rabbi Yehuda seems to be uncertain if we concern ourselves with the male parentage, because he says that a mule may not be mated with a horse or a donkey, but only with another mule.  If he truly believed that the male parentage is not followed he would not have said that, instead he would have said the mule may be mated with another mule that shares a maternal type.  Instead he is in doubt, and when he said that we do not concern ourselves with paternity he meant that we cannot be lenient on that basis, but we must be strict when relevant.   In any place that a stringency will result from ignoring paternity, then we ignore it, because it is a case of doubt so we must be strict in every place.  In light of this I say that if we conclusively know the identity of the father we should be concerned for \"it and its offspring.\"  More details are explained in the eighth chapter of Tractate Chullin.",

The editor wrote in the name of Maimonides (Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Precept #63) that this sin has three components, two of which are on the public on one pertains to the individual.  The first is in any case that one is asked to transgress one of the mitzvot during a time of persecution, and the enforcer intends for this to be a transgression, whether the mitzvah is severe or nor, or if one is asked to transgress idolatry, sexual impropriety, or murder even during a non-persecutory time, he must give his life and be killed rather than transgressing.  If he transgressed and did not die he has profraned the Name in public, and he has violated this commandment, and his sin is very serious.  Nevertheless he is not flogged as he was coerced, and the court can only enforce corporal punishment for deliberate transgression, where there are witnesses and warning.  The Sifra (Kedoshim 4:13) says, on the verse \"If one gives his children to Molech, I will place My face against that person,\" That TOBM said \"That person, and not a case of coercion, nor indavertency, nor confusion.\"  I have already explained that a person who commits an act of idolatry under coerced cicumatances is not punished with kareit, and he is certainly not executed.  He has violated the prohibition against profaning the Name.", 
                "The second type is if a person commits a sin without desire or pursuit of pleasure, but his action is intended to infuriate [God].  This is also profaning the Name and he is flogged, and this is why it says, \"And do not swear falsely in My name and profane the Name of your Lord.\"  In this case the person shows his anger with this thing where there is not physical pleasure in it.  The compoment which addresses the individual is if a person who is well known as a kind person who acts well and commits one misdeed, something that is unfitting for a person of pious character, even if it is a permissible act, he has profaned the Name.  This is what the TOBM said (Talmud, Yoma 86a), \"What is profaning the Name?  If I were to purchase meat from the butcher and not pay immediately.  Another rabbi said, 'If I were to walk four paces without teffilin and without words of Torah.'\"   This prohibition is repeated elsewhere in the verse, \"Do not profane the Name of your Lord, I am HaShem.\"",

The Sifra says (Sifra Emor 8:6), \"For this reason I took you out of Egypt, so that you will publicly sanctify My name.\"  The same is true for the other two - he must die and not transgress.", 
                "The root of the mitzvah - It is known that Man was only created to serve his Creator.  One who does not sacrifice his body in the service of his master is not a good servant.  Since people do give their lives for their masters we must certainly be willing to do so for the commands of the King of kings, The Holy One Blessed Be He.", 
                "From the laws of the mitzvah - TOBM said that for these three that we mentioned, a person must always give his life, whether it is a time of persecution or not, whether in public or private, whether the coercer intends to force a religious change or for his own benefit.  For other sins, however, if there is no persecution and it is in private he should transgress and not be killed, even if the intent is religious coercion.  If it is public, that is in the presence of ten Jews, if it is for the coercers benefit, he should transgress.  If it is religious coercion he should be killed.  If there is persecution, even in private and even for his benefit, even for a trivial mitzvah he should be killed. A trivial mitzvah is like what TOBM said, \"even a shoe lace,\" which means a Jew should not wear his shoes in the idolatrous fashion, because he should not look like an idolater.  This is a subcategory of idolatry, anything that is prohibited by a unique prohibition is the field of idolatry, like that TOBM said (Talmud, Pesachim 25a), \"One who is in peril may be healed by anything except for asheira wood.\"  The Yerushalmi said on this (Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 14:4) that is not only if the doctor says, \"bring me those asheira branches\" which would then seem like deifying it.  It even applies is he says, \"bring some leaves of that tree\" and they can only find the asheira, martyrdom is still required.  Even though when he is healed in this case it is not truly idolatry, for he did not worship it, it is still prohibited because of the prohibition of \"keep nothing of the banned in your hand\" (Deuteronomy 13:18), which is a unique prohibition in the category of idolatry.  But the many restrictions that apply to idolatry that are learned from \"do not place a stumAbling block before the blind\" are not considered a subcategory of idolatry for the purpose of martyrdom, because that prohibition is not unique to idolatry, as it applies to every mitzvah", 
                "After I wrote this I found in some of the novellae of my teaceher (may HaShem protect him) that from the Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud, Avodah Zara 2:2) it seems that if the doctor does not specify [asheira] he should transgress and not die.", 
                "The idea of murder is derived by TOBM from reason, and they said by way of parable, \"What do you see that your blood id redder?  Perhaps the blood of that man is redder.\"  That is, the murdered might be capable of performing more mitzvot than the murderer, and therefore logic dictates that no one can kill anyone else, even if the consequence is death.  They also said, (Jerualem Talmud, Terumot 8:4) that even if there were several thousand Jews and the coercers asked for one of them, or if they should refuse, everyone will be killed, they must all be killed and not give up any Jewish life.  This only applies if they do not specify a person, but if they expressly ask for some individual they may give him over, as in the well known story of Sheva ben Bichri. This is also  the case if they ask for a woman [to rape] as we see in Terumot (Mishnah, Terumot 8:12).", 
                "The idea of sexual impropriety is derived from a connection between the betrothed maiden and murder, and just as murder demands martyrdom, so too a person must doe and not debase a betrothed maiden.  the Torah does not simply tell stories if we cannot learn from them.  They also had support from their tradition which is an iron wall for all that they say.  The early authorities wrote that we only say a person must die rather than sin, but to failing to perform a mitzvah doe not demand martyrdom, as TOBM said about Esther, that she was like still ground.  She was passive and she was raped, and even is the woman assisted in the intercourse midway, she is excused because lust overtook her, and this is the greatest coercion there is.  That we find that the ancient pious ones were killed even for the sake of a mitzvah like TOBM said (Mechilta, Shemot 20:6), \"Why are you being stoned?  Because I circumcised my son.  Why are you being hanged?  Because I shook the lulav.\"  That was an extra measure of piety that they saw was needed in their generation.  Those great sages were qualified to make that judgment.  Otherwise they would not have been permitted to die, becasue not everyone can allow himslef to be killed for other matters than those that were specified by TOBM.  Moreover, they would be held repsonsible for the loss of their lives (Rambam, Yesodei HaTorah 5:4).", 
                "I have also seen in the works of my teacher, that any woman who can be betorhted, such as a widow to the High Priest, or a divorcee to a priest, or a mamzer to a Jew/Jewess, all these cases are not considered improprieties such that one must die for them.  Still, we would not advise anyone to have intercourse with any woman, even if she is single.  He should instead die from the illness that has come from his passion, not cohabit or even speak with her, as we see in Sanhedrin (Talmud, Sanhedrin 75a) and the Book of Madda (Rambam, Yesodei HaTorah 5:9).  More details are explained int he 8th chapter of Sanhedrin and the Peachim, Yoma and elsewhere.", 
                "The miztvah always applies to men and women.  One who transgressed and did not sanctify the Name in a circumstance where he was obligated to do so, has failed to fulfill this mitzvah, and he has also violated the prohition against profaning the Name, as I have already written (Sefer HaChinukh 295).  The sin of profaning the Name is very severe to the point that TOBM said that repentance, Yom Kippur, and afflicitons are not sufficient to atone, only death, as we see in the last chapter of Yoma (Talmud, Yoma 86a)."

The seventh month is called 'Tishrei', as it is the seventh from Nissan, which is the New Year for [the count of] months.  The Sages said that this day, the first of Tishrei, is called the New Year for the count of the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee, and we also count from it for plantings and vegetables. (Talmud, Rosh HaShanna 2a).  In the Talmud (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 12a) the Sages explained for what purposes this is considered the New Year.  They also said there (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 16a) that on this day the inhabitants of the world are judged for their deeds.  They explained [HaShem's] awareness of the deeds of each individual and every type as a group, that metaphorically each passes before Him in a orderly procession, that is, one at a time and not combined.", 
                "From the root of the mitzvah of this holiday: It was the kindness of HaShem with His creations that he remembers each of them and views their deeds one day each year so that the sin should not mount so greatly, and this allows for the possibility of atonement.  He is abundantly kind and skews toward kindness, and since the sins are [relatively] few, He forgives them. If there are perhaps sins that require expiation, they will be retributed in small pieces.  This is like what the Sages said, \"For His loved ones he retributes in small pieces.\" (Talmud, Avodah Zarah 4a)  If He did not remember them for a longer period they would become so abundant that the whole world would be deserving of destruction, God forbid.", 
                "Thus this honored day is responsible for the sustaining of the world, and it is therefore appropriate to make it a holiday, a part of the count of special days in the year.  On the side that it is the day of judgement for all living things it is proper to stand in more fear on this day than the other holidays of the year.  This is the concept of 'recalling the shofar sound' that is mentioned in connection with this day, because the shofar sound is a broken sound, and it hints to the need for each person to break his evil inclination and regret his evil deeds, as I will explain at length on the mitzvah of Shofar (Sefer HaChinukh : Mitzvah 405), with HaShem's help.  It is for this reason that the Sages did not establish the recitation of Hallel on this holiday, as they said, \"It is not proper for a person to sing songs of praise while he stands in judgement.\"  Rabbi Abahu also said in the final chapter of Rosh HaShanna (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 32b), \"The ministering angels said the HaShem, 'why do the people of Israel not say Hallel on Rosh HaShanna and Yom Kippur? et al.\" as you will find there.",

The idea of changing a name seems to be that a person should think of himself as if he is someone else (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Repentance 2:4) and improve all of his ways.  Thus anytime he is called he will remember this change and pay attention to it.  They also said that three books are opened on Rosh HaShanna, one for the truly righteous, one for the truly wicked, and one for the people in between.  The idea of opening books seems to be a parable to describe the attentiveness that HaShem has to people.  The Sages always used familiar expressions to allow their ideas to penetrate the ears of the listener.  The righteous are immediately written and sealed for life. (My teacher explained that 'truly righteous' in this instance means 'totally innocent', and 'truly wicked' means 'totally guilty') [The wicked are] therefore sealed immediately for death, since they have no merits to protect them.  [The judgement of] those in between are left suspended until Yom Kippur, at which time a final verdict is sealed.  They also said (in close proximity to the preceding), \"Beit Shammai said, 'there are three groups of people on the Day of Judgement (meaning after death of each person, which is called the Day of Judgement): the truly righteous, the truly wicked, and those in between.  Here they explain that 'truly righteous' and 'truly wicked' reflect the result of the judgement, which resolves any great questions about the issue.  If you merit, my son, you will be sensitive to this and my efforts will put you at ease.",

It must be at least 7x7 hand-breadths; less than that is invalid.  It needs three walls, and a doorway that it formed by two vertical posts and one on top of them.  The law requires that it have more shade than sun, and if it does not it is invalid.  If one makes a thick house-style roof it is valid. The law is that one may build his Sukka between trees and allow the trees to serve as walls, and one may build a Sukka on a wagon or a boat.  The law is that one may cover over a porch that has door-frames, whether they are onside or outside.  The roof must be made of something that is not susceptible to ritual impurity, such as the leftover stalks and bramble, but not from something that is susceptible to ritual impurity.  The law also considers a case where invalid cover is placed in the middle or on the side.  The law is that three [hand-breadths] of airspace invalidates the covering,  whether it is in the middle or on the side in a small Sukka.  The law is that placing a sheet over the Sukka because of the sun or below [the cover] because falling detritus invalidates it.  If they are hung for beauty it is valid, as anything that beautifies the Sukka is valid.", 
                "The law addresses a  Sukka above another Sukka, The law is that one who sleeps in a canopy in the Sukka may not do so if the roof is even one hand-breadth wide, though he may if it is less.  The law is that if one sleeps under a bed in the Sukka, if the bed is higher than ten hand-breadths he may not do so, but if it is not he may.  Even though [sleeping under] a canopy is forbidden if it less than ten hand-breadths, the bed is different because it is primarily intended to be used as a platform.  If one placed a sheet on two poles he  may sleep underneath it as it has no roof, and it is like making space by supporting it under his arms, which is obviously permitted.  The law is that a stolen Sukka is valid, as land cannot be stolen.  Even if one stole wood and made a Sukka out of them it is valid, as the Sages passed an edict that he is only repsobsible to pay for the wood.  The law is that one who is suffering is exempted from Sukka, for the Torah said 'you shall sit' [which is understood to mean] as you live.  Certainly an ill person is exempted for this reason, and even his nurses are exempted.  Similarly, anyone who is an emissary to perform a mitzvah, and also the bride-groom and his clique, as they are performing a mitzvah.  The law also addresses travelers and watchmen for gardens and orchards, and city watchmen, and rain falling, and the Sukkot of GNB\"Kh and RQB\"Sh, that are valid.  The law is that the wood used to build the Sukka is biblically prohibited for any other use for all seven days, and on the 8th and 9th day in the Diapsora they are forbidden because they are considered set aside.  The decorations of the Sukka are forbidden because of it would degrade the mitzvah to use them, so it is said in the name of Nachmanides (Michamot, Beitzah 4:5).

The Sages also said that on a Torah level money is effective even for movable properties, but the the reason they required dragging the item was as a safeguard to avoid the seller saying \"your wheat burnt in the loft.\"  Because of this enactment the Sages said that (Baba Metzia 49b) if the object was in the buyers possession, even if he rented the space to the seller, since the domain is the buyer's and he is always attentive to the state of the object, if something should happen to the object he could recognize the risk rescue it as the seller could, in this case the sale is enacted only through money as the Torah prescribed, and not through dragging it.  Also, i the buyer rents the place that the object is located, dragging et al become ineffective.   The Sages said (Talmud, Baba Batra 85b) that just as a a person's person can acquire for him, so too his belongings can acquire for him in any place that he may leave them.  Once the object is placed inside a vessel neither can retract; it is as if it was lifted or placed inside his house.  In a place where the buyer may not place his vessel, his vessel will not acquire for him, such as the seller's property, or the public domain.  Nevertheless, the Sages said that in the seller's domain if the seller says, \"acquire with this vessel\" or even if he doesn't say it but the buyer acquired another vessel by lifting it and then placed the produce intended for purchase into the vessel, he has immediately acquired the produce.  The pleasure that the seller receives from the sale of the vessel causes him to forgive the place that it sits, and it is as if the vessel is in the buyer's domain.", 
                "Handing over the object works differently, and it is only effective in a public domain or a space that belongs to neither of them (Talmud, Baba Batra 76b).  This method is used for objects that are too large to be lifted or even dragged, such as a large ship that requires an enormous undertaking and a large number of people to move.", 
                "Dragging is also different, as it only acquires on a sidewalk, which is the area adjacent to the side of the public domain, where people commonly leave their vessels.  Any vessels left in such a place may not be moved by another person.  Dragging also acquires in a yard that belongs to both of them, and lifting is effective in all places, as he is lifting the object, and his person can acquire because his body is his domain in all places.", 
                "There is another method of acquisition on a Torah level which is called 'exchange', which was the old method in Israel.  It is essentially a trade of an object for an object, or an object for land, and the Sages said (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Sales 5:5) that once the first party dragged the object the be exchanged, the other object is acquired wherever it may be.  If anything then destroys the object, the loss is absorbed by the purchaser.  Barter only works for vessels and not produce, as produce cannot be used (Talmud, Baba Batra 47a) as implied in the verse, (Rut 4:7) \"And this was the early custom in Israel, a man would remove his shoe.\"  Nevertheless, even though produce cannot be the medium of barter, produce can be acquired through barter, i.e., a person can use a vessel to acquire produce through barter wherever they may be.  The same is not true of coins, which can neither be bartered for or with, because people always think about the face value and it may be devalued by governmental action.  Thus, it is not of constant predictable value and people do not have faith to acquire with it, and it cannot be used for barter.  A coin without face value can be used for barter like any other object.  This is a coin that is no longer in circulation as Reish Lakish said, \"even a purse filled with coins\" which Rabbi Abba understood to refer to coins that were cancelled by the Emperor or the Governor.   ", 
                "When we say that something is not used as barter it does not mean that the sale is annulled and the intended some need not be paid, for he is certainly obliged to pay in full for whatever he has purchased, since he dragged the produce.  "

Do not say to him in the way that Job's friends spoke (Job 4:6),\"Is not your reverence, your confidence...\"  If one sees donkey drivers seeking feed, do not tell them to go to so and so's place, when he knows that he does not have any.

And one who is lenient to them not to cause them pain in these matters, will find life, blessing, and honor. And one who transgresses this and pained his fellow with words, with the ones our sages of blessed memory specified--with a penitent or a sick man or those like them--he transgressed this negative commandment, but he does not get lashes, since there is no specific action. And there are several lashes even without the whip of cattle that are in the hands of the Master Who commands about this, may He be exalted and blessed.",

And in truth, the Torah did not command for a man to be a stone silent to his insulters like to his blessers, but it did command us to distance ourselves from this trait and that we should not begin to quarrel and insult human beings. And therefore every man will be saved from all this, because one who doesn't quarrel will not be insulted by people, except for complete fools, and we don't pay attention to fools. And if perhaps some insulting person will force him to answer his words, it is proper for a wise person that he will reply to him in a roundabout and pleasant way, and not become angry much, because \"Anger rests in the heart of fools (koheles 7:9)\". And he will save face before those who listen to his insults, and he will cast the burden upon the insulter, and this is the best way among men. And we should learn this thing, that it is permitted to us to reply to a fool according to what it seems from how the Torah permitted one who comes to rob secretly to be advanced on and killed (shemos 22:1), for there is no doubt that a man is not obligated to bear harm from a fellow; rather he has permission to save himself from his hand, and similarly from the words of his mouth that are full of deceit and oppression, in anything that he is able to save himself from him. Yet--there is a group of people that their righteousness rises so much that they do not want to bring themselves into this leniency to reply something to their insulters--perhaps anger will overpower them and they will become involved in the matter more than is enough, and about them they of blessed memory have said: those who are insulted but to not insult back, who hear their shame and do not reply, about them the verse says: \"And those who love Him are like the sun coming out in its strength.\""

That is the view of Maimonides (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Shemitta and Yovel 11:1).  Nachmanides (commenatary on the Torah) wrote that this would then be analogous to the Tallmud's discussion in Temura (Talmud, Temura 4b) where Rava said that anything that the Torah proscribed is ineffective and subject to flogging, as he has violated the edicts of the king.  Nachmanides explained it differently, and that is that the lnad cannot be sold to non-Jews, that is, we may not sell to them as a permanent sale.  He explained the verse to mean that we may not sell the land to one who will hold it forever, and that is a non-Jew.  It cannot apply to a Jew because he will return it.  If he stipulated that the non-Jew must return the land it is permitted to sell it to him.",

We said above that in that case both parties have transgressed this law and their action is ineffective, as one may not make conditions that violate the Torah and the Torah said that the land cannot be sold permanently.  If, however, a number of years is mentioned it is not permanent.  The Sages may have derived this from the wording of \"not permanent\" as opposed to \"only until the Jubilee\" which implies that anything other than a permanent sale does not return in the Jubilee.", 
                "Nachmanides explicitly wrote that (commentary on Makkot, 3b) that if one stipulates that the field will  not return in the Jubilee the condition doe not stand and the field does return.  The same is not true for the Sabbatical year, where if one loans on the condition that it will not be cancelled by the Sabbatical the condition does stand, as this relates to money.  He explained that regarding the cancellation of debts the Torah only prohiibitied the activity of the lender, as it says \"Every creditor should cancel all that his fellow owes him\" (Deut. 15:2).  The borrower, however, retains the right to repay if he so desires.  In the context of the Jubilee both the seller and the buyer are included, as we have written, the Torah says \"shall not be sold\" to both of them, as the land belongs to HaShem, and no person has the right to sell it permanently.  Therefore, neither has the authority to forgive the rule, and land is forcibly returned to the ancestral owner, even if they make a thousand conditions that it should not return.  This is a good reason.", 
                "Also in the laws of the mitzvah is the Sages statement (Talmud, Arachin 30a) that if one sells an ancestral field and he also owns other lands, that is, land that he purchased or receives as a gift, and then he sells those fields to redeem his ancestral land, he is not heeded.  The Torah says, \"and he finds enough to redeem\" implying that he did not have it at the time of the sale.  Similarly, if he borrowed and wished to redeem with those funds he is not heeded, as it says \"his hand reached\" and not that he borrowed.",

These are called the ancestral fields, and their laws differ from other lands for the purposes of redeeming.  Ancestral land can be redeemed by the seller or another redeemer after two years without the consent of the buyer.  Other fields, which are called purchased lands, can only be redeemed with the buyers consent, or else they stay with the buyer until the Jubilee.",

We will write later (Sefer Hachinuch 340) that they can also be redeemed without the buyers consent, as it says, \"it shall be redeemed\", but they can be redeemed even in the first year, like houses in a walled city.

They also said (Talmud, Arachin 29b) that if one sells his field, whether it is ancestral land or purchased land, he may not redeem it for two years, even with the permission of the buyer, as the Torah commands that it stay with the buyer for two years in the verse \"for two harvests it is sold to him.\"  That is directed to the seller; the buyer is included in the verse, \"for a number of years it is acquired\", which must be at least two.  It seems that the idea is that any sale of land must be an act of distress, and a person should not think that he can sell his land and redeem it immediately. He should know that there will be at least two years from the time of the sale that he will miss.  The Sages also said that the buyer must receive two years of harvest from the land, and if one of his years is a year of drought and disease, or a Sabbatical year, it does not count.  [A lean year, however, is counted.]  If he sold it in the Jubilee itself, the sale is invalid, and the money is returned.  If he sold just the trees, they may not be redeemed for two years, and if they are not redeemed they are not returned in the Jubilee, and it says, \"he will return to his portion\" and not to trees.  If he sold it to A and A sold to B and B to C, even if there are 100 buyers, the field returns to the original owner at the Jubilee, as it is written (Lev 27:24) \"to he who is the inheritor of the land.\"  Other details are explained in Tractate Arachin.",

Similarly, a  field may not be allowed to revert to meadow, nor vice versa, etc.  They may not be altered in any way.  The concept is well understood, for the Torah commanded (Num. 35:2-7) that the other tribes cede certain cities to the Levites, and these are the 48 cities with the six cities of refuge included.  The Torah also commanded that each city be surrounded by 1000 cubits of meadow (area that provides opportunity for leisure and aesthetic to the city), and 2000 cubits beyond that for fields and vineyards, which also has aesthetic value for the city and provides some of its needs (see Talmud, Sotah 27b).  This law teaches that those states can never be altered, and concerning this it says, \"The fields, meadows and cities shall not be sold.\" We understand the word 'sold' in this context to mean 'altered', for if it were addressing actual sales it would be contradictory as the verse explicitly says that the Levites can always redeem their lands from a buyer, which implies that they may sell them.",

Because they were set aside to serve God and minister unto Him and to instruct people at large in His just paths and righteous judgments, as [Deuteronomy 33:10] states: \"They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Torah to Israel.\" Therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world. They do not wage war like the remainder of the Jewish people, nor do they receive an inheritance, nor do they acquire for themselves through their physical power.

Why did the verse divide them?

This may be an application of the Sages' concept of \"the Torah speaks in a human voice\" (Talmud, Berakhot 31b); the Torah repeats transgressions that require more vigilance, just as people will repeat themselves and use enhanced language to indicate the severity of an issue so that the listener is vigilant about it.  Though a person should be most careful about the words of HaShem even if they are communicated through the slightest hint, in His great kindness He repeated some commands many times as a parent teaches a child, and we should therefore thank him for all the goodness that he bestows upon us.",

                "The laws of the mitzvah, such as the distinctions that the Sages taught us between interest that is prohibited from the Torah, which they call (Talmud, Bava Metziah 61b) 'definite usury'.  Other forms are rabbinically prohibited, which the Sages called 'the dust of usury'.  There is also another level which is lower than these first two, and this is really permitted as it is far removed from Torah level interest and is not suited for an edict, but the Sages were very strict in this matter for they saw that the Torah is very strict on it.  They passed these restrictions so that a person would not try to work around the law, and not for some other reason.  [Returning to] the three types of interest: Torah level interest describes a case in which a person says to his fellow, \"lend me a manah and I will give you a peruta every day\" or 30 perutas a month, or some other amount, until I pay you back.  Or if he says, \"lend me 100 dinar and i will pay you back 120 after a year,\" or if he lends money and takes a house or courtyard as collateral with the stipulation that he will hold the land and reap the benefit of the produce until the loan is repaid, without subtracting something from the repayment amount, this is definite usury and is prohibited from the Torah.  The general rule is explained by the Sages as \"any case of payment for the time [that the money is kept] is prohibited from the Torah\" (Talmud, Bava Metziah 63b), if the money comes from the borrower to the lender.  In this case the Sages said, \"Definite usury can be extracted by the court\" (Talmud, Bava Metziah 61b). That is, the court may seize assets from the borrower, as is the law for theft and torts.  Others explain that the court is licensed to physically coerce the lender, as is customarily done to someone who refuses to fulfill a positive mitzvah.", 
                "Every other form of interest (aside from those mentioned) are called Rabbinic usury or 'the dust of usury', and they money cannot be retrieved by the court.  The Sages prohibited these as a safeguard lest a person come to transgress the biblical prohibition.  Some forms are like the Sages rule (Talmud, Bava Metziah 70b) that one cannot accept an investment with a guaranteed return of principle from a Jew, nor may deals be priced with produce before it is evaluated (though if the value is established it may be used, for even though the buyer may not possess the produce, someone else does).  This only applies if the buyer does not possess the produce; if he does possess some, even a small amount, he may use it before the price is set.  For instance, he may price out several Se'ah even if he only possesses one, as the law follows Shmuel who took this position in the Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 75a).  When we say that he must have the same type, some hold that it must be exactly the same (Beit Yosef, Yoreh De'ah 175), e.g. he may not set the price in new wheat if he only has old.  Others hold that we do not make a distinction between old and new, anything within the same type is sufficient.  Nevertheless, if he does possess the type, he may price with it even if it is some preparatory steps removed form the relevant product, but if it is more than three steps it is considered something else entirely.  The Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 74a) elaborates on the various steps involved in preparing wheat, as well as manufacturing tools and other things.", 
                "The mitzvah also includes the prohibition against lending with land as a collateral, such that if the money is not returned by such and such a day the land will belong to the lender (Talmud, Bava Metziah 66a), because the acquisition is not binding as it is not performed with certainty.  That is, a person made the assumption that the money would be returned on time and he was not able to fulfill his intention; this is akin to an accident.  In any similar case it is forbidden to reap the benefit because it is interest.  The Talmud provides many examples of uncertain arrangements in matters of interest and other areas.  My teacher (may HaShem guard him) taught us that any punitive condition, that is, if it is not fulfilled a financial penalty will  be applied, is called uncertain, and concerning this the Sages said \"uncertain arrangements are not binding.\"  Another expression they use is \"any 'if not' is not binding.\"  Any condition, however, that a person makes with his fellow in the form of \"if you do such and such, I will do such and such,\" as people commonly create conditions, is not uncertain, for if it were how could we ever make conditional arrangements (as they all must be dependent on 'if' statements).  Moreover, what could we say about the many conditions that pertain to marriage and divorce?  They are all 'if' statements!  Rather, it must be as we said, that only punitive conditions are considered uncertain, such as \"if I don't pay you by day X the field will be yours,\" or whatever the collateral is, but not for the great many other conditions that people stipulate, such as \"if you go to place X I will give you sum Y,\" or \"If you do X for me I will give you 200 zuz\" etc.  Understand this, my son, give heart to it, and through this a heavy fog will be lifted from before your eyes in many issues in the Talmud.", 
                "They also said (Tamud, Bava Metziah 75b) that early or late interest is prohibited.  What does this mean?  If a person decided that he wanted to borrow money from someone and sent him gifts to encourage him to lend, this is early interest.  If he borrowed and returned the money, and then sent gifts in recognition of the fact that his money was idle, this is late interest.  Some authorities also said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Creditor and Debtor 6:7) that if one lends money to his fellow with land that constantly produces value (like a courtyard, bathhouse or market stall), if it is done withut a discount it is genuine usury, and if there si a discount it is 'dust of usury'.  But if the loan is made with the land that does not constantly produce value (like a field or vineyard, as sometimes the expense involved exceeds the revenues) without a discount it is not usury, and with a discount it is permitted.  Other authorities say that the Sages even prohibited this latter case, and the only permissible form of collateral is the Syrian style, in which they would write, \"at the end of these years the land will transfer without funds.\"  In truth it seemed from the Talmud to our teachers (HaShem should keep them) according to the best explanations, that any collateral that is made with a discount, whether it is a house or bathhouse that produces profits, or a field or vineyard, it is all permitted with a discount.  This is the custom in our regions based on their words, and one who is concerned for the view of the great sages who were strict in this matter will be blessed from heaven. ...", 
                "What was prohibited by the Sages to avoid creating ruses?  If a person says to his fellow, \"lend me a manah [=100 zuz]\" and the other responds, \"I have no manah, but I have a manah worth of wheat.\"  If he then gives him the wheat and buys them back for 90, this would certainly be legal, but the Sages forbade it because it allows for a ruse of interest.  It is apparent that this is like usury, as this one gave 90 but will receive 100 in return, but if it was already done the court would extract the full 100, as this is not even the 'dust of interest'; it is only prohibited as a safeguard.  Also, if one had a field as collateral he may not rent it to its owner as this is also a ruse.  Similar cases are described in the Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 68a).  Even though these are only forbidden as ruses, some other activities are permitted even though they seem like genuine usury.  The Sages permitted them because they could not lead to other transgressions.  For example, a person may sell debt at a discount, and he may also pay an agent to procure a loan from another Jew on his behalf.  The general principle is that the Torah only forbade interest that goes from the hand of the borrower to the lender.  This is because the Torah usually describes the dominant case and leaves out the details, and as the standard case is funds transferring directly from the borrower to the lender this is the command of the Torah.  Even though all this is true, any moral person should stay as far from any kind of usury ruses as possible.  Anyone who pursues vehicles to extract interest payments from another Jew will eventually see his fortune dwindle, as the Sages said, \"Anyone who deals in interest shrinks his portfolio.\"  (Talmud, Bava Metzia 71a)  They also said, \"A peruta of interest causes a loss of storehouses full of cash.\" (Talmud, Bava Metzia 75b)  Many more details are explained in the fifth chapter of Bava Metziah.", 
                "The mitzvah always applies to both men and women.  One who transgressed and loaned money with a prohibited form of interest has violated this commandment, and the money may be extracted by the court, directly from his assets, as is the law for theft and torts (according to the first view), or we may use coercive techniques to retrieve the money as is the law for one who refuses to fulfill a positive mitzvah (according to the view of my teachers).  If he loaned with a rabbinic form of 'the dust of interest' he has transgressed a rabbinic edict, but the money cannot be retrieved by the court.  If the borrower seized the interest amount from the lender we do not take it back from him.  If the interest was in the category of the ruse ,we obviously don't force the lender to return it and we even retrieve the money from the borrower if he seized it, as this was the arrangement that they agreed to.  Since this is only a stringency to avoid real situations of interest, we do not police it after the fact, which for this purpose is defined as when the conditions have been fulfilled by both parties."

                "It is forbidden to force a Hebrew slave to performing demeaning or degrading tasks, as one would a non-Jewish slave.  As it is written, \"Do not work him as a slave.\" (Lev 25:29)  The Sages said in the Sifra (Sifra, Behar 7:2) explaining this matter that, \"he should not carry your cushion (which is a small cloth the people carry to sit on if they tire, and the way of the slave is to carry his master's implements for his master), nor should he carry his bath tools into the bathhouse.\"   The Sages mentioned these, and we can learn from them for all similar activities.  It emerges that a person should be mindful of what he orders his Hebrew slave to perform, and this is part of the principle that the Sages said, \"one who acquires a Hebrew slave has acquired a master for himself.\" (Talmud, Kiddushin 22a) Nevertheless, the verse says that he will be a \"laborer and a worker with you,\" which implies that he may be ordered to perform all customary forms of work.  In general a free laborer is not employed for degrading work, nor is a migrant worker, who stays with the master and performs his work at will.  Therefor the Torah said that he should be like a worker, because these men, even though they do work, are usually not employed in slave-style labor.  Still, the slave must behave as a slave and honor his master to the best of his ability, and he should not become haughty with all that we have said.",

He should also recognize that just as this slave was sold because of his desperation, the same could happen to him, or to one of his sons (if they should be sinful), and through honoring his slave he will certainly recognize this, and through this though he will avoid sin.  Another purpose if to instill the values of kindness and compassion, and to distance us from the evil trait of cruelty, and through establishing good characters we will receive goodness, as HaShem wishes to bestow His blessings on His creations, as we have said many times before.

One who transgressed and forced his Hebrew slave to perform degrading work has violated this commandment, though it seems that he is not flogged as there is no deed; words are usually used to instruct a slave.  I already wrote (Sefer HaChinuch, 241) that any prohibition that can be transgressed without a deed, even if an individual did in fact perform a deed while transgressing, still does not incur flogging, as it is still termed a prohibition without a deed.

This is the accepted explanation of the verse (Talmud, Kiddushin 24a) \"You shall work them forever.\" (Lev. 25:46)  Our Sages said (Talmud, Gittin 38a), \"Rav Yehuda said, 'Anyone who manumits his slave is in violation of a positive commandment, as it says \"You shall work them forever.\"'\"  Canaanite in this context includes any non-Jewish person who was acquired by a Jew as a slave; all slaves are attached to Canaan because he was cursed with slavery for him and his progeny.   Even though this section is clearly discussing actual Canaanites, as it says, \"from the peoples that surround you you may purchase a slave or maid-servant,\" and earlier it says, \"As I give you the Land of Canaan,\" our Sages still knew that this really applied more broadly to all people, and there are no differences in law between Canaanites and others.",

Similarly, if a non-Jew has relations with a Canaanite slave woman, the offspring is a slave, as it says, \"that are born unto you in your land.\"  If, however, one of our slaves has relations with a non-Jewish woman, the offspring is not a slave, as a slave has no paternity.  A resident alien, that is, a non-Jew who has accepted that he will not worship idols and will live in our land, who sold himself to a Jew is treated as a Canaanite slave.  Our Sages said (Talmud, Yebamot 48b) that when a Jew acquires a slave he has twelve months to convince him to abandon idolatry, get circumcised, immerse in the mikva, and accept the obligations that apply to a Jewish woman.  If he refuses, he may not stay longer than twelve months, and he must be sold immediately.  It is only those slaves that were circumcised and immersed that the commandment to 'work them forever' applies.",

If they could not find slaves among the other nations, they would they need to enslave their brethren, who would then be unable to strive in the service of HaShem.  We were therefore commanded to retain those who serve us after we have readied them and removed idolatry from their mouths , lest they be a source of strife in our homes.  This is the meaning of the verse, \"And as for your brothers, the Children of Israel, a man unto his brother shall not impose hard labor.\"  That is, if we follow this we will not need to enslave our brethren, and everyone will be able to serve HaShem.  Even though the verse also teaches that a Hebrew slave cannot be subjected to hard labor, there are many meanings in every verse.",

You should not wonder how we can forsake a biblical mitzvah in favor of a rabbinic one, because the foundation of the mitzvah is only the advancement of the service of HaShem, and manumitting in this case meets that end.  Moreover, the freed individual is now capable of fulfilling more mitzvot on his own, hence the Sages said (ibid.) that is is permissible to free him, as this is what they had received. ",

Even though he is granted freedom with such an injury we still require that the master compose a writ of manumission, and we force the master to do so after this kind of injury.  The Sages also said that (Talmud, Gittin 43b) one who sells his slave to non-Jews or Samaritans, or even to a resident alien, [effectively] frees his slave.  Also, a Jew who lives in Israel who sells his slave to another Jew who intends to take him out of Israel [effectively] frees his slave.  Similarly, the Sages taught (Talmud, Gittin 40a) that if his master marries him of to a free woman, or if he helps him don tefillin, or calls him up to read three verses before the congregation, or anything else that is only an obligation of free men, he has [effectively] freed him, and we force the master to compose a writ of manumission.  Therefore, the master must be careful to avoid doing any of these things so that he will not violate this mitzvah, unless it is done for the sake of another mitzvah (as we explained above).  The laws of the composition of the writ, as well as other details, are explained in Tractates Gittin and  Kiddushin.",

They would place expertly engraved stones before the idols and they would prostrate upon them.  We might also explain that it seems like worshiping the stone itself; since the stone was prepared and beautified it arouses suspicion.  Bowing on clothing arouses no suspicion as clothing are easily destroyed and therefore unworthy of worhip, whereas a stone, which has both staying power and a corresponding angel in Heaven (as the Sages said (Talmud, Chullin 40a) \"Whether he speaks to the mountain or to 'Gada' of the Mount, which is the angel that is responsible for the mountains, he arouses suspicion.\") The Torah distances us greatly from anything that others might suspect as wrong, with the added purpose of preventing others from being misled by his actions.

If he did not spread out he is not flogged, but they would administer the 'rebel's beating.'  Within the context of actual idolatry there is no distinction between spread out and not spread; as soon as one bows his face to a foreign god he incurs the penalty of stoning Talmud, Horayot 4a).  The Sages also said (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Idolatry 6:7) that if he placed rugs on the stone and covered them, he may then prostate there.  They also said that the prohibition applies everywhere except the Temple, for in the Temple one may prostate one's self to HaShem on stones, as it says, \"do not place in your lands\" [which implies that] it is in your lands that you may not prostate, but you may prostate on the stone surfaces in the Temple.  This distinction may be understood based on the reason we have given, that people will suspect the prostrater of deifying the stones, and as the Temple is chosen for the service of HaShem, and it is as clear as day that the only worship that is performed there is directed to Him, there is no room for suspicion.  If, however, we follow Maimonides' rationale, that it is to distance us from what was an idolatrous practice, we should be even more careful in Temple to avoid corrupting the thoughts of the one who comes to prostrate himself to HaShem.  Still, I know that Maimonides had sound reasons for everything he said, and sometimes the inadequacies of the reader can confuse the matter.  More details are explained in Tractate Megillah.",

That is, unless he explicitly states that the proscription be rendered unto HaShem, or to improve the Temple, as the Sages said, \"unspecified proscriptions are to to the kohanim\" (Talmud, Arakhin 28b).

They are instead under His direct Providential Hand without any intermediary of an angel or fortune, as it is written, \"For HaShem is the portion of His people.\" (Deut. 32:9)  We see this in the story of the Exodus from Egypt, which was a miracle that included all the people, that He took them out by Himself in His glory, as the Sages derived from the verse, \"I will pass through Egypt\" (Ex. 12:12) - I will and not angel, \"I will strike the firstborns\" - I will and not one of the host, as we read in the Haggada.  Therefore, as long as Israel maintains the Torah and serves HaShem only goodness will come to them, and the flow of blessing and a pure benevolent spirit will support them, and the opposite, the curse and the 'proscription' will come to their enemies and antagonizers. As such, if one of them gets angry and pronounces words f curse and proscription on his property or land, which are included in this blessing, the verse teaches that one cannot remove the rights to it from the blessed one to another authority.  Everything that is owned by Israel, who is the portion of HaShem, is really His, as whatever a slave comes to possess belongs to his master (Talmud, Pesachim 88b). Still, since it is clear that the proscriber intends to remove the object form his possession, it is proper to allow his will to be fulfilled and return it to the possession of his Master, and it becomes sacred.

For this same reason the Sages said (Tamud, Arakhin 28a) that any property of the kohanim and levites is not subject to proscription, that is, even if the kohen or levi says that his field should be come proscribed, it has no effect.

The  kohen proscriptions, which are any unspecified proscription that automatically goes to the kohen, can never be redeemed, and they must be given to the kohen like termuah.  Concerning the proscriptions of the kohanim the verse says that they \"shall have no redemption.\"  They cannot be sold to another, and they cannot be redeemed [and retained] by the original owners.  Both land and movable property were given to the kohanim in the current service cycle at the time of proscription.  During the time that the original owner reatins the proscribed article it is treated as sacred for all purposes, as it is written, \"Anything proscribed is totally holy to HaShem.\" (Num 18:14)  Once it is given to the kohen it is completely ordinary, as it is written, \"All proscription in Israel shall be for you.\"  A field that is proscribed and given to a kohen never returns to the owners.

Still, if one did tithe from the old animals and crops onto the new or vice-versa, Rambam (Laws of Firstborns, 7:5) wrote that he believes that the tithe is valid becasue of the severity of the tithes, as the verse is actually written with respect to grains, and we only need to be as strict as the rule there, where it is only a priori.",

And [so] he is sent out of three camps, which means out of Jerusalem; whereas those who have a genital flow whose impurity is not so stringent are [only] sent out of two camps, which are the camps of the priests and the camp of the Levites, and that is outside of the Temple mount; and one impure from a dead body whose impurity is [in some regards even less] stringent is only sent out from one camp - hence it is permissible for him to enter the Temple Mount. And what is the stringency of those with abnormal genital flows over one impure from a dead body? That the [former] renders impure that which is resting or sitting upon him, even when [separated by] a stone, whereas the one impure from a dead body does not impart impurity this way. And one impure from a dead body, and those that have intercourse with a menstruant and all gentiles more generally are sent out from the perimeter (<i>chail</i>), whereas someone who has immersed in purifying waters but only becomes pure at the end of the day (<i>tevul yom</i>) enters there. A <i>tevul yom</i> is sent out of they courtyard of the Israelites and the women's courtyard, whereas one lacking [only] the atonement sacrifice is not. But from the courtyard of the Israelites inwards, even one lacking the atonement sacrifice does not enter.

And one who transgresses it and enters a place that he is not permitted while he is still impure, along the guidelines that we have explained, has nullified a positive commandment; besides having transgressed a negative commandment, as we will explain in this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 363), with God's help."

But one who is impure from the impurity of a dead body, for which a nazirite does not shave - even though he is impure [with] an impurity [requiring] seven [days before being able to be pure] - is exempt [from excision] for coming into the Temple. And so [too,] one who touched vestments that touched a person who touched a dead body, or if he touched a person who touched vestments that touched a dead body - even though he is impure [on the] first [level] regarding impurity and to impart impurity to sanctified meat - behold, such a one is exempt for coming into the Temple. And these things are a law of Moshe from Sinai (halakha le'Moshe me'Sinai). And even though he is exempt, they would give him lashes of rebellion. And all of the impurities for which a nazirite must shave about or not shave about are elucidated in Tracate Nazir. And one who throws impure vestments into the Temple - even if they were impure vestment that touched a dead body - is exempt from excision, but liable for lashes. As it is stated (Leviticus 17:16), \"And if he does not wash and his flesh he does not bathe\" - and we learned form the tradition (Sifra, Acharei Mot, Chapter 12 13) that for [failure to]  bathe his body, he is punished by excision, but for [failure to] wash his clothes, he is lashed forty [times].

                "<b>The commandment of confession of sin:</b> We are commanded to confess before God our sins that we have sinned, at such time that we feel remorse for them. And this is the content of confession: to say at the time of repentance, \"Please, God, I have sinned, I have transgressed, I have rebelled [in] such and such,\" meaning to say that he mention the sin that he did explicitly with his mouth. He should [then] seek atonement for it and extend his words in this matter according to his fluency. And they, may their memory be blessed, said that even sins that require the bringing of a sin-offering still demand confession with the offering, and about this it states (Numbers 5:6), \"Speak to the children of Israel [saying], a man or woman who commits from any of the sins of man and rebels against the Lord, that soul is guilty and they shall confess the sins that they did.\" [The Sages] said  in the Mekhilta (Sifrei Zuta on Numbers 5:6), \"Since it says 'confess the sin' (Leviticus 5:5) it means that the sin must be extant, that is that the sin-offering is alive and not slaughtered.\" This mean that the animal to be offered must still be alive. They also said there, \"We see that one must confess if he renders impure the Temple and its holy things. From where do you know to include all other commandments?\" That is that this verse in Parshat Vayikra only [discusses] one who renders impure the Temple and its holy things; from where do you know to include all other commandments? \"As it is written, 'Speak to the children of Israel, etc. and they should confess.'\" That is, that we expound the verse as if it is not written about a specific thing.  \"And from where do we know that its understanding [includes sins that are punishable by] death and excision? Since it is stated about the confession of Aharon in Acharei Mot (Leviticus 16:16 'for all their sins'.\" [The Sages], may their memory be blessed, expounded [on this verse] to include negative commandments; and 'that they did' which is written here to include positive commandments, meaning to say that if he does not do a positive commandment that he could have done, he is obligated to confess about it. And they further expounded there in the Mekhilta, \"'From any of the sins of man' - from that which is between him and his fellow, theft, robbery and evil speech.\" And this confession truthfully requires that he return the '[theft] that is in his hands,' as if he does not do so it would be better not to confess about it. \"'To rebel' includes all those sentenced to death who must [also] confess. I might have thought to include even those convicted by false witnesses\"; that is, even though he knows that he did not sin, except that false testimony was testified against him, that he be obligated to confess about this. \"Hence the verse teaches, 'soul [that] is guilty' - I only said when there is guilt there, but not when he knows that he did not sin, except false testimony was testified against him. Hence we understand that [for] all iniquities, large and small - even positive commandments - a man is obligated to confess about them.", 
                "And since this commandment of confession comes with the obligation to bring an offering - as is written in Parshat Vayikra there (Leviticus 5:6), \"And he shall bring his guilt-offering, etc.\" - one might think that the confession is not an independent commandment on its own, but rather only one of the things that are an extension of the sacrifice. Therefore they had to elucidate in the Mekhilta that such is not the case, but rather it is indeed an independent commandment. And so they said there, \"I might have thought that I only confess when they brought [offerings]. From where do I know even at the time that they do not bring [them]? Since it is stated, 'the children of Israel[...] and they shall confess'\" - meaning to say that the tradition comes to expound [it] in this way.  \"Still, I might have thought that there is confession only in the Land\"; that is, even though one may confess without the sacrifice, nonetheless, that the obligation for confession is only in the Land, as that is the locus of atonement, and the sacrifices are there and the locus of everything is there. \"From where do I know to include the Diaspora? From that which is written (Leviticus 26:40), 'And they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers.'\" That is, the iniquity of their fathers who sinned and were exiled from the Land. \"And so [too,] did Daniel say outside of the Land (Daniel 9:7) 'For You, Lord, is the righteousness and for us is the shame on this day.'\" Hence it is elucidated that confession is an independent commandment and that it is practiced in all places. And they also said in the Sifra (Sifra, Acharei Mot, Section 4 6), \"'And they shall confess' -that is verbal confession.\"", 
                "It is from the roots of this commandment [that it is] because through the verbal admission of iniquity, the sinner reveals his thoughts and opinion: that he truly believes that all his deeds are revealed and known before God, blessed be He, and that he will not act as if 'the Eye that sees' does not see. Furthermore, through mentioning the sin specifically, and through his remorse about it, he will be more careful about it on another occasion not to stumble in the same way again. Since he declares verbally, \"I did such-and-such, and I stumbled in my deeds,\" he will have created a fence so he won’t repeat what he did. And through this he will be wanted by his Creator. blessed be He. And the Good God, who wants the good for His creations makes them walk in this way, [that] they merit with it. ", 
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Taanit 15a) that repentance is that the sinner leave the sin and remove it from his heart and from his thought, and he decide in his heart not to do like this again, as it is written (Isaiah 55:7), \"Let the wicked give up his way, the sinful man his thoughts\"; and afterwards, he must confess about it, meaning to say that he say the words of repentance orally, as it is stated (Exodus 32:31), \"and they made for themselves a god of gold.\" And he must also mention explicitly that he will not return to do the sin again, as it is stated (Hosea 14:4), \"and we will not again say 'our god' about the work of our hands, etc.\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (see Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 1:2), that the scapegoat would atone for all sins when one repented, light and weighty - whether he transgressed them volitionally or accidentally whether it was known to him or unknown to him. But if he did not repent, the scapegoat only atones for the light ones. and what are the light ones and what are the weighty ones? [Weighty ones] are sins for which one is liable for the death penalties of the court or excision; and also vain and false oaths are from the weighty ones, even though they not come with excision. And the other positive and negative commandments that do not come with excision are called light, in comparison to the weighty ones. And now that we do not have the Temple and the altar of atonement, due to our sins, we only have repentance. And repentance atones for all sins. And even if one was a complete evildoer all of his days and he repented completely at the end, we do no mention any of his evil, as it is stated (Ezekiel 33:12), \"and the wickedness of the wicked will not cause him to stumble when he turns back from his wickedness, etc.\" To what do these words apply that repentance alone suffices? To sins between man and the Omnipresent, such as one who eats something prohibited or has a prohibited sexual intercourse and so [too,] one who negates one of the positive commandments and similar to it. But [regarding[ sins between a man and his fellow, such as one who injures his fellow, or robs his money or with any other thing through which he illegally injures him - whether in action or in speech - it is never forgiven him with repentance  alone, until he gives his fellow what he owes him and until he is appeased. And they, may their memory be blessed, have already said (Yoma 87a) what is his remedy if his fellow does not want to be appeased by him. And also from the content of the commandment is that which they said in the Tosefta that there are twenty-four things that prevent repentance, and they enumerate them there. [This] and the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated in the last chapter of Yoma (see Mishneh Torah, Laws of Repentance 1).", 
                "And this commandment is practiced in every place and at all time by males and females. And one who transgresses it and does not confess about his sins on Yom Kippur, which is the day that is set from always for forgiveness and atonement, has nullified this positive commandment. And woe to a man, if he dies without confession and carries his iniquity.", 
                "And the essence of confession that we received from our Rabbis and that is the custom of all of Israel to say during the Days of Repentance is, \"However, we have sinned, we have been guilty, etc.\" And they, may their memory be blessed said in Shabbat 32a in the chapter [entitled] Bemeh Madlikin, \"One who became ill and tended toward death, they say to him, 'Confess,' as it is the way of all those executed to confess.\" And so [too,] in Tractate Semachot, it is taught, \"One who tended toward death, they say to him, 'Confess before you do not die. Many confessed and did not die, and many who did not confess died and many that are walking in the marketplace [have] confessed, as you live from the merit of your confessing.'\" If he can confess orally, he [should do so], and if not, he said confess in his heart. And Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman (Ramban), may his memory be blessed, wrote (in Torat HaAdam, Chapter of the End, regarding confession) that he received [a tradition] from pious men and men of good deeds that such is the confession of someone on his deathbed: \"I admit in front of You, Lord, my God and God of my fathers that my healing is in Your hands and my death is in Your hands. May it be the will in front of You that You heal me [with] a complete healing. But if I die, let my death be atonement for all of my sins and my iniquities and my rebellion that I have sinned and been iniquitous and rebelled in front of You; and let my portion be in the Garden of Eden, and make me merit the World to Come that is safeguarded for the righteous.\" And remember this order, to say sins first and afterwards iniquities and afterwards rebellion - the way we have mentioned, \"I have sinned, I have been iniquitous, I have rebelled (<i>chatati, aaviti, pashaati</i>)\" - as Rabbi Meir and the Sages already disagreed about this in the Gemara (Yoma 36a). Rabbi Meir reasons that it is the opposite, that we say like Moshe said, \"Who carries iniquity, rebellion and sin\" (Exodus 34:7). But the law is like the Sages who reason that one mentions sins first. And the reason for the matter is explained in the Gemara."

And that which they said (Sotah 18b) that if she drank the bitter waters once about another man and she was rendered innocent by them, and he went back and was jealous about her from him [again], and she secluded herself with him [again] - she never drinks another time on his account.

And Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman, may his memory be blessed, also wrote (Ramban on Numbers 5:15) regarding the matter of the sacrifice of the <i>sotah</i>, on the level of its simple meaning, that the husband brings this sacrifice from his [possessions] for the jealousy that he has towards her, so that God, may He be blessed, will take vengeance from her. And the reason for the barley (<i>seorim</i>) is that there be 'an angry storm (<i>saara</i>) of the Lord going out, and the storm land on the head of the evildoer, that it land on the head' of the unfaithful woman; and like the matter of griddle bread of barley that is stated with Gidon (Judges 7:13), which they interpreted as a great, tumultuous storm.

And about this, the Scripture stated, \"wine vinegar and spirit vinegar shall he not drink.\" And these are not two [separate] negative commandments, meaning to say one about wine and one about vinegar; as behold, it did not state, \"wine vinegar shall he not drink and spirit vinegar shall he not drink.\" And we have learned from here that one who drinks wine and vinegar is only lashed for one [commandment].", 
                "I will write that which I have known about the roots of the matter of naziriteness in the commandment of growing the hair of the nazirite in this Order (Sefer HaChinukh 374). And the distancing of the nazirite from all mixtures of wine is all from the reason that is written there.", 
                "From the laws of the commandment is that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Nazir 34b) that anything that comes out of the grape, whether it is the fruit or the refuse - meaning to say the <i>zag</i> which is the peel, and the <i>chartsan</i>, which is the seed that is inside it - is forbidden to the nazirite, and as it is explained in the Scripture. But behold, the leaves, the shoots, the vines and the immature berries (<i>smadar</i>), they are permissible; since they are not fruit and not refuse, but are considered like the tree. [This] and the rest of the many details of the commandment are elucidated in the tractate that is built on this, and that is Tractate Nazir.", 
                "And this prohibition is practiced by males and females in every place and at all times, as anyone who vows [to become a] nazirite is obligated to abstain form wine, spirits, wine vinegar, spirit vinegar and from any grape marinade. And one who transgresses this and drinks a <i>reviit</i> of a <i>log</i> of wine, or ate a <i>kazayit</i> of grapes that are wet or dry, or from their refuse which is the seeds and the peels, is liable for lashes. And even if he ate a <i>kazayit</i> from among them all - meaning to say that he took a little from each one of those [items] that we mentioned, until among all of them, there was the measurement of a <i>kazayit</i> - and he ate it, he is lashed; as all prohibitions of the nazirite combine one with the other to a <i>kazayit</i>, to require lashes because of them. But other prohibitions in the Torah do not combine one with the other, except for the meat of a carcass with the meat of a 'torn' animal (<i>tereifah</i>), and a sacrifice disqualified by the wrong thought (<i>pigul</i>) with a sacrifice disqualified by its lateness (<i>notar</i>), which combine. And the six items in the thanksgiving sacrifice also combine, which are fat, meat, fine flour, oil, wine, and bread. And it is not necessary to say that everything that is of one name combines, such as the carcass of an ox, the carcass of a lamb and the carcass of a gazelle, and similar to this (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Forbidden Foods 4:17)."

                "The Nazir, who is the person who is separated from wine, is obligated to let his head hair grow for all the days of his seclusion for HaShem, as it says, \"He shall grow the locks of his head.\" (Num 6:5)  The Mechilta explains, \"Growing the hair is a positive commandment.  The negative command is \"a blade shall not pass on his head.\"", 
                "From the root of the mitzvah: I already wrote in the introduction to this work that this world was created by HaShem with something that combines physicality and intellect, and that is Man. It is therefore fitting for the dignity of HaShem that this creature attain the most complete level of understanding that can be achieved, as I wrote above.  There is no doubt that without this reason that the intellect is forced to combine with the physical, which is in a state of perpetual sinful baseness, the intellect should be close to HaShem and in praise of Him, recognizing His Honor like one of the ministering angels.  Still, since the intellect does live within the physical it must occasional tend to the needs of its landlord, for a house of sticks and stones cannot stand without a person minding it.  If so, as man is created in the manner described, whenever the intellect can suppress the physical and focus on the service of its Master it is good for it, so long as it does not completely ignore the  work of the house and destroy it.  This would also be considered sinful as the King wished the creature to function in this way.  It is like the saying of Rabbi Yosi, (Ta'anit 22b) that a person may not afflict himself on a fast day, which Rav Yehudah explained in the name of Rav as stemming from the verse \"and man was a living thing\" (Gen 2:7), which implies that the soul should be allowed to live.  On the same basis the wise king said, \"Do not be overly righteous; do not be overly wise.  Why should you be desolate?\" (Ecc. 7:15)  This is the holiness of the Nazir as he departs form the physical.  On this Simon the Just1 said: In the whole of my life, I ate of the guilt-offering of a defiled nazirite [only once].  This man who came to me from the South country, had beauteous eyes and handsome features with his locks heaped into curls. I asked him: 'Why, my son, didst thou resolve to destroy such wonderful hair?' He answered: 'In my native town. I was my father's shepherd, and, on going down to draw water from the well, I used to gaze at my reflection [in its waters]. Then my evil inclination assailed me, seeking to compass my ruin,  and so I said to it, \"Base wretch! Why dost thou plume thyself on a world that is not thine own, for thy latter end is with worms and maggots. I swear  I shall shear these locks to the glory of Heaven!\"' Then I rose, and kissed him upon his head. and said to him: 'Like unto thee, may there be many nazirites in Israel. Of such as thou art, does the verse say, When a man shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite to consecrate himself unto the Lord.' [trans Soncino - http://halakhah.com/nazir/nazir_4.html#PARTb]  Therefore, in order to suppress the evil inclination, the Nazir is told to shave his head and not to fix it up to the way it was before.  He must shave it all for there is no doubt that both very long hair and shaven heads are destructive to the appearance of a person.", 
                "Do not argue with me with the Sages satement (Nazir 19a), \"He must bring an atonement offering for he pained himself by avoiding wine\" for this also works with my explanation.  We have already said that a person does not have the right to destroy the house that was built by the First Architect, for perhaps this person has overstepped this boundary and harmed his body.  Perhaps being a Nazir is damaging to this individual's constitution, as all the ways of HaShem are righteous and the just follow them.  Nachmanides explained simply (Rambam on Num 6:11) that the sin-offering is for returning to ordinary life and the desires of the world.  Since this person had once had a 'spirit of HaShem' and became a Nazir, he should have stayed that way for his whole life.  There are 70 faces to the Torah.", 
                "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages taught (Nazir, 39a) that is the Nazir shaves with or wothout intent, or even if it is an accident, his count of Nazirite days is over and he must count another 30 days (as we know that a standard Nazir period is 30 days (Nazir, 5a)) so that he has a lock.  When is this true?  If the majority of his head was shaved with a razor tosomething like it and there was no longer enough hair to fold over to the root. If only the minority was shaved he does not lose his count, just as he does not lose his count by drinking wine even for several days, though he does lose it by becoming impure as the verse describes.", 
                "The Sages also said that all variations on the term of Nazir are effective.  For instance, if a person had a speech impediment, or lived in a place where everyone has a speech impediment, and they say 'nazik' ir 'nazich' or 'pazich', and he said about himself \"I will be a pazich\" etc., he is a Nazir.  We do not say that the formulation in his intent and his vocalized intent must match, as we do for oaths.  Once he has decided to become a Nazir and he says something that demonstrates that intent, even thought he words themselves do not positively identify him as a Nazir, it is effective.   They also said that adjuct expressions are effective, which describe a case where a person says \"I shall be\" as a Nazir passes before him.  Or if he says, \"I will be beautiful\" and holds his hair, he is a Nazir.  Or if he says, \"I will be a Nazir from grape flesh, or shaving only, or impurity, he is a complete Nazir.  If he says, \"I will be a Nazir on the condition that I will drink wine\", or become impure, or shave, he is a Nazir, and all are prohibited, because a condition which violates the laws of the Torah is cancelled.  One may reneg on a Nazir vow in the same way that one renegs on any vow.  A father may make a Nazirite oath for his son up until age thirteen, but the mother may not, and this is our tradition.  Non-Jews are not subject to the rules of Nazir, though women and slaves are.  A husband or father may annul the Nazir vow of his wife or daughter like other oaths, as may a master force his slave to drink wine or become impure.", 
                "The mitzvah that a Nazir must grow his hair always applies to men and women.  Even though the Sages taught (Nazir 19b) that Nazir only applies in Israel, that is that a person must observe his days of Nazir in Israel, and the days that he is a Nazir outside of Israel do not count in his tally, still, he must observe the rules of Nazir outside of Israel as well.  Therefore, id one made a Nazir oath today he is a permanent Nazir, as we have no ability to offer the sacrifices at the end of the period.  The Sages also taught that we coerce the Nazir to go to Israel and to fulfill his Nazir vow there until he dies or until the Temple is rebuilt an "

Maimonides wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandment 34) that even though this mitzvah is given to the Levites, that was only in the desert, for their were only a few Kohanim.  In future generations the Kohanim were obligated in this mitzvah as is apparent from Joshua (Joshua 3:6) and Samuel.", 
                "Nachmanides wrote that it is not true that the mitvzah was moved to the Kohanim, God forbid that we should ever say that any mitzvah in the Torah changed, and that the Levites should be disqualified from carrying the Ark.  He seems correct, and we see that the Levites did carry the Ark during the tome of King David, as it is written, \"And HaShem assisted the Levites who were carriers of the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem\" (I Chron. 15:26), and it says, \"And all the Levites were carrying the Ark ...\"  In truth, even though both the Koahnim and Levites are accpetable for carrying the Ark as far as the Torah is concerned, as they are all called Levites, as in the verse \"the Levitical Kohanim\" (Ez. 44:15), and also \"And the Kohanim and Levites sanctified themselves to carry the Ark of HaShem the Lord of Israel and Moshe had commanded by the word of HaShem, with the poles on their shoulders\" (I Chron. 15:14-15).  The Sifrei explains, \"Where was the command?  [From the verse] \"and to the sons of Kehat was not given any other ....\" as they are all called the descendants of Kehat.  Nachmanides also wrote that Maimonides' proofs from Joshua and Samuel are not so clear, and in fact indicate the opposite, as it is written there, \"and he commanded the people saying, 'When you see the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem that is carried by the Kohanim, Levites\" (Joshua 3:3).  The truth is as we have said, that the whole tribe is eligible to carry the Ark, and this is explained further is the Talmud (Sotah 33b) where the Sages say, \"How did the Israelites cross the Jordan?  Every day the Levites carried the Ark, and on this day it was carried by the Kohanim.\"  That is, on the day that they crossed the Jordan the Kohanim carried it alone, as it is written, \"And Joshua said to the Kohanim, 'Carry the Ark of the Covenant'\" so that the miracle would be done by the Kohanim, as they are the holiest members of the tribe.", 
                "It also seems that Maimonides' explanation fo this verse in Joshua is not clear at all, as we have said.  And the verse in Kings that says, \"And the Kohanim brouh the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem to its place, to the Holy of Holies\" (I Kings 8:1) should also not pose a problem, because the Levites were not permitted to enter the Holy of Holies; that was limited to thew Kohanim.  The main point seems to confirm the view of Nachmanides, that the entire tribe may carry the Ark, as is clear from the verse, \"And he said to the Levites ... place the Holy Ark in the Temple that was built by Solomon son of David, the king of Israel, there is no longer a burden on your shoulders\" (II Chron. 35:3).  Furthermore, this indicates that the people would have no more need to carry the Ark form one place to another, but it does not indicate that if it were to move it would not be done by the Levites, and this is clear and obvious to all.  The Sages said (Chullin 24a) that blemishes disqualify the Kohanim but years do not - it is only the priestly duties that are not affected by age, but age does indeed disqualify for  the labor of carrying, as is the rule for the Levites.", 
                "From the root of the mitzvah: The main glory of Israel is the Torah which makes us distinct from other peopels and the portion of HaShem, and it is therefore proper that it should be carried by the most dignified and holy people among us.  I have need to elaborate on matters that any school child can understand.  The performance of the mitzvah is expressed in the verse, and that is that the Kohanim and Levites would carry the Ark on their shoulders whenever it moved form place to place, such as during war or some other time, and it would not be put on a wagon or the back of an animal.  The Sages indicted David for a mistake that even children know to avoid, as he palced the Ark on a wagon (Sotah 34a).", 
                "The mitzvah applied when the People of Israel lived in their land, for then there was [occasional] need to carry the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem for war or by the command of the king.  Today, in our sinfulness, we have no king and no Ark to carry in any place.  The mitzvah applies to all the Levites and to the rest of the people to support them.  The contemporary practice in the Diaspora of bringing the Torah to greet the non-Jewish kings is not governed by this mitzvah at all, and any Jew may carry it.  If as a way of showing honor to the Torah they choose a Levite even today, may blessing come upon them."

                "Anyone who was unable to offer the first Paschal offering on the fourteenth day of Nissan ,for example, due to ritual impurity or distance, is commanded to offer the second Paschal offering on the fourteenth day of Iyar.   As it is written, \"On the second month on the fourteenth day, in the afternoon, you shall offer it.\" (Num. 9:11)  Our Sages also taught (Pesachim 73a) that it is not limited to ritual impurity or distance, but any case of inadvertency or accident, or even if onr willfully refused to offer the first one, may offer the second one.", 
                "From the root of the mitzvah: The Psachal offering is a powerful and clear sign to all of the creation of the world.  For at that time the great and mighty God performed miracles for us and changed the rules of Nature in public view, and all the peoples of the Earth saw his Providence and Omnipotence, and at that time everyone believed and all who followed them knew that the Blessed One created the word ex nihilo at the time that He chose.  That was the Age of Knowledge, for even though creation ex nihilo defies the laws of physics, splitting the sea to allow the passage of a great assemblage of people is too, as is sustaining a large population for forty years on heavenly bread, and all the other signs and miracles that He performed for us at that time as they all changed the order of Nature and indicated something new happening.  This is the firmest pillar of our faith and our Torah, for people who believe in the eternity of the universe have no stake in the Torah and no place in the World to Come.  This is known and there is no need to elaborate on well known matters.  Therefore, HaShem wished to allow everyone Jew to merit in this important mitzvah, and circumstances should not prevent its fulfillment, and if something prevents a person form fulfilling it in the first month, they may do so in the second.  Since this is a fundamental basis in our religion the obligation extends even to a person who converted between the two months, or a child who reacehd maturity in this window, that is, they must bring the second Paschal offering.", 
                "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages taught (Pesachim 95a) that the differences between the first and second offerings are as follows - On the first all leaven is forbidden to be kept in one's possession, while on the second both leaven and matza may be in the house.  The second lasts for only one day, and there is no prohibition against performing labor. The forst requires that Hallel be recited while eating it, the second does not, though both require Hallel during the offering.  Both are eaten with matza and marror, as is explicit in the verse.  Both supercede the observance of the Shabbat, and neither may be left over or have bones broken in them, as the verse explicitly prohibits by saying, \"do not leave over\" and \"do not break a bone in it.\"",

They derived this from the fact that the verse singled out a few laws, while if the laws were truly identical it would have been sufficient to simply state, \"perform it according to the laws of the Paschal offering.\"  They said, \"Just as the bone is remakable in that is part of the body, so too anthying, etc.\"", 
                "Also included in this mitzvah is the Sages statement (Pesachim 93a) that an impure person is delayed to the second Paschal day, which referred to someone who is impure in a severe way that prevents him from eating the Paschal offering, such as someone who experienced a flow, or a menstruant, or a new mother, or someone who became impure through contact with the dead under circumstances that would require a Nazirite to halt his period of Nazir, or if he touched a carcass or a vermin, or something like it.  Even if he will immerse in the mikva on the fourteenth before the time of the offering, and he only needs to wait until evening to complete his purification when he would be allowed to eat the Paschal lamb.  Also included in this mitzvah is the Sages statement (Pesachim 93b) that a 'far distance' in this context means anything that is fifteen mil outside of the walls of Jerusalem, but less than that is not called a far distance.  More details are explained in Tractate Pesachim.",

A man who willfully did not fulfill this mitzvah and did not bring the second Paschal offering after he was unable to offer the first, incurs Spiritual Death, as this is the view of Rabbi [Yehudah HaNasi] in the mishnah (Pesachim 93a). Rabbi Natan, Rabbi Chaninah and Rabbi Akiva ll exempt him from Spiritual Death as he was not willful in the first case.  We need not say that of he deliberately did not offer the first time,, and he was also did not bring the second offering, whether willfully or not, that he incurs Spiritual Death according to all, as he deliberately failed to offer the sacrifice to HaShem in its proper time.

Even though the verse describes a holiday, this is not precise, and it applies every day for every sacrifice.  It is explained in the Talmud (Rosh HaShannah 29a), that everyone is obligated in the sounding of the Shofar, Kohanim, Levites, and Israelites.  The Talmud asks if this is not obvious (for who else might be obligated), andas  it responds that that we might have thought that Kohanim should be exempt as they are obligated in the regular sounding of the whole year, as  is written in this verse.  The Talmud then asks if they are really similar, as one is a trumpet and the other a shofar, but nevertheless, we see from here that trumpets were a daily feature of the Temple.  The Tamlud also says (Arakhin 13a) that there were always between 21 and 48 trumpets blasts in the Temple.", 
                "From the root of the mitzvah: A requirement of the sacrifice is that those present focus their attention, as it is well known that improper thoughts disqualify the offering and that offerings require complete awareness of the One who commanded that they be brought.  It is also essential during times of distress for a person to appeal before his Creator for mercy and salvation.  We are therefore commanded to sound trumpets at these times, for people in all their physicality demand noticeable calls to matters of importance, for the way of nature is to stand asleep.  Nothing is as stirring as the sound of instrumentation, as is well known, and this is well achieved through trumpets, which are the loudest of all musical instruments.  Another purpose, aside from focusing attention, is also realized through the trumpet, and that is the removal of all worldly concerns from the heart of the listener, such that no thoughts other than the offering remain.  Why should I go on so long?  This is well known to anyone who has ever paid attention to the sound of a trumpet or a shofar.",

However, I have seen that Rambam wrote (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Utensils of the Temple 3:5) that \"on all the festivals and the New Moon the Kohanim would sound the trumpets and the Levites would sing.\"  It seems from his language that he thought that on other days even the Levites could sound the trumpets.

It turns out that the dough is food for our body and food for our soul. Additionally, so that the servants of Hashem, those that constantly strive in His work - and these are the Kohanim - should live without any toil at all.

The five types of grain that are obligated in Challah are wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye, for it says, \"and whe you eat from the bread of the land.\" 'Bread' refers only to doughs made from these, and they all may be added to the necessary volume.  If one did not separate Challah from the dough he may take it from the bread, as it says, \"when you eat from the bread,\" implying that bread is still obligated.  Even if one first kneaded a quantity that was insufficient to be obligated in Challah, if he then kneaded another batch such that the two combine to the requisite volume, if they are then put into the same vessel they are obligated in Challah.  I heard from my teacher, May God protect him, that this is only if the bread was taken from the oven and put into a vessel that has a trench, but if it was placed on a board or on the floor, or anything else that has no inside, even though they were subsequently placed into a basket, they are already exempt from Challah.  This is what they meant when they said, \"one who removes it into a basket;\" it is only if it went from the oven to the basket.  It should also be clear that that the oven does not serve to combine the batches.  The pebbles that are in the dough are counted toward the total volume is they are not sifted, but if they are sifted and then added back in, they do not count to the total.",

The Sages however said (Mishnah, Challah 2:7) that 1/24th should be given, which they based upon the continuation of the verse, \"give to HaShem.\"They understood this to mean that the gift should be dignified, and this was the amount that they estimated.  A baker who prepares his dough for sale in the market whose quantities are larger, and he also needs to make a profit, needs only give 1/48th.

If there is no other dough available he should take Challah from the mixture without blessing, for all of it has been rendered 'unseparated'.  Even a small amount can render a large amount 'unseparated' if it is mixed in, for 'unseparated' material creates a prohibition at any proportion, as I wrote above (Sefer HaChinukh 284).  More details are explained in Tractate Challah and Tractate Orlah.", 
                "The mitvah applies to both men and women in Israel on a Torah level. This is based on the verse, \"when you eat from the bread of the land.\"  It is also limited to the time that the majority of the people of Israel are there, as it says, \"when you come\" which the Sages explained (Ketubot 20a) to mean that \"all of you\" and not some you are there.  On a Rabbinic level we are obligated to separate Challah even outside of Israel, so that the rules of separating Challah will not be forgotten by the people.  Because it serves only as a reminder we take some leniencies with the law, such as only separating a small amount from a large dough, and discarding of it in fire, and not giving it to any kohen, child or adult.  I have heard that in some places they still separate Challah according to the old proportions, and they give it a pre-pubescent kohen boy or girl, or even to a an old kohen who is passed the age of virility. Even though he is impure due to contact with the dead, he may still eat it according to those practices.  It also seems that another leniency outside of Israel is that one may deliberately be cancelled by majority, as the Talmud explains (Bekhorot 27a).  I do not believe the same applies to other prohibitions in the Torah, with the exceptions wood that fell into a fire pit on a festival which can have other wood added to it to cancel those, as they said (Beitzah 4b), \"a person may add wood to them permit them.\"  they explained that the reason is the prohibited portion is consumed by fire, and we can therefore be lenient.", 
                "Rambam wrote that today when there is no pure dough because contact with the dead, Challah is separated once in all Israel, which is 1/48th, and it is burned because it is impure. This has a basis in the Torah .  From Keziv to Amnah a second Challah is separated and given to the kohen, but this has no required amount as was the original law.", 
                "Challah outside of Israel, even though it is impure, is not prohibited to be consumed by a kohen unless he has impurity that emits from his body, as it is only a rabbinic decree.  Therefore only those who have seen seminal emissions or gonorrhea, or mestruant women or those who have recently birthed, or lepers, may not eat it.  Therefore, if there was a kohen child outside of Israel, whether in Syria or elsewhere, if they want to they may separate one Challah as 1/48th and it may be eaten by a pre-pubescent child, boy or girl, and there is no need to do a second separation to burn it.  Also, if there is a kohen man who is no longer virile, even if it is the same day that he immersed in the mikvah, and even though he is impure from contact with the dead, he may eat this first Challah, and there is no need to do a second separation outside of Israel."

                "We are obligation commanded to put fringes on the clothes that we wear, as it is written, \"and they shall make fringes for themselves.\" (Num. 15:18)  This obligation applies to garments with four or more corners, as it is written, \"on the four corners of your garment\" (Deut. 22:12)  'Four' includes five or more, provided that the garment is large enough that the head and most of the body of a child who is old enough to walk in the marketplace unescorted can be wrapped in it.  It seems that this age is around six or seven years old.  The garment must be made of wool or linen to be obligated in tzitzit when it is worn.  If it is missing one of these conditions, i.e. if it has fewer than four corners or is not as large as described, or it is or made from some other material, it is exempted from tzitzit on a Torah level.  Silk, camel hair, rabbit hair, and goat hair are all exempted from tzitzit on a Torah level, as 'garment' in the Torah refers only to those made from sheep's wool or linen, as is also the case for tzara'at of clothing.", 
                "The root of the mitzvah is explicit in the verse.  It is to provide us with a constant reminder of the commandments of HaShem, and there is no better reminder in the world than carrying the seal of the Master on one's clothes at all times, as a person is always attentive to his clothes.  This is what the verse means, “and you will recall all the mitzvot of HaShem” (Num 15:39).  The Sages (Tanchuma, Korach 12) wrote that 'tzitzit' alludes to the 613 commandments when combined with the eight strings and five knots.  I also feel that there is another reminder here that the soul and body of Man belong to HaShem.  The white portion corresponds to the body which is from the land that is made of snow, as we find in the Midrash (Pirka D'Rebbi Eliezer, 3), “Where is the land from?  From the snow that is under the Holy Throne.”  The threads also allude to the body, as they said that the initial formation of a body is but threads, as we find in the Talmud (Niddah 25b), “Rabbi Amram taught: the two legs are like two strands of silk, as are the arms.”  The blue portion which looks like the sky hints to the soul which is from on high,which the Sages implies when they said (Menachot 47b), “What is so unique about t'chelet?  T'chelet is like the sea, and the sea is like the sky, and the sky is like the Holy Throne, as it is written, 'And they saw the Lord of Israel …' (Ex 24:10) and 'The throne appeared as sapphire' (Ezek. 1:26).”  The souls of the righteous are stored underneath the throne and this is why the Sages said (Menachot 39a) that the t'chelet is wrapped around the white, as the soul is above and the body below.  They said that it is wound seven ar thirteen times to allude to the heavens and the divisions between them, as the Sages said, “One who wishes to do fewer should not go lower than seven, nor should he add more than thirteen, corresponding to the seven heavens and the six air-spaces between them.", 
                "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages said (Menachot 43b) that is a garment has five or more corners we only put tzitzit in the four most distant corners.  They also said (Menachot 28a) that all four tziztit are one mitzvah and are all required to fulfill the mitzvah.  They also said (Menachot 38a) that the t'chelet is a separate mitzvah from the white strings, which does not mean that they are actually counted as two mitzvot, but it means that is one is missing the other can still be a fulfillment of a mitzvah.  This is the case today where we cannot find t'chelet; we should still not hesitate to put white fringes without t'chelet onto our garments.  Also, when the t'chelet is available, if one has no white strings he may place the t'chelet on his garment and wear it with a blessing.", 
                "The t'chelet dye that we are commanded to use, which is similar to a pure blue sky, is made from the blood of a fish called chilazon, whose blood looks like the bottom of the ocean (Menachot 44a).  It is found in the Dead Sea area, and it was used to dye wool.  For many years we have not heard of anyone using this dye.  It muse be dyed for the sake of the mitzvah, and the white strings must be spun for the sake of the mitzvah.  We may not use wool that was caught in a thicket or from skin that was torn from the animal, or from the remnant  left over from the loom, or from stolen wool or wool from a city of idolaters, or from sacred wool.  If any of these was used it is disqualified.  Tzitzit that were spun by a non-Jew are disqualified, as it is written, “Speak to the Children of Israel … and they shall make.”  If a Jew made them without proper intention it is acceptable.  I have heard from great scholars that tzitzit made by a women are disqualified.", 
                "How are the tzitzit made?  Four strings are fed through the corner of the garment , such that there are now eight ends hanging from the corner.  This is not done precisely at the corner, but a half-thumbs distance from the edge, as Rabbi Yaakov and Rabbi Yochanan said in the Talmud (Menachot 42a), “It must be one large joint away.”  One of the stings should be longer so that it can be used for winding the others.  Five double knots are tied, and between each knot three spaces are left, and between the final knot four spaces, so that there are a total of thirteen spaces.  The strings are made long so that at least two thirds of the length are free hanging.  This is the ideal fulfillment of the mitzvah.  But as a basic fulfillment even one space suffices, and even if the strings shorten, even so far as there is only enough to make a basic bow it is acceptable. (Menachot 38b).  But if one string is completely missing it is disqualified.", 
                "One who owns a four cornered garment is not required to put tzitzit on it so long as he does not wear it.  The law follows the view of Rav who said, (Menachot 42a) that tzitzit is an obligation n the wearer, meaning that the obligation is for a perosn to put tzitzot on a garment when he wears it, but a garment that is sitting in a drawer does not need tzitzit.  The law does not follow the other view that it is an obligation on the garment itself, which would mean that is a person owns many four cornered garments he would have to ensure that they all have tzitzit.  This is not the case, as thr law follows Rav.", 
                "If one has a linen garment he should place linen tzitzit in it, for the law does not follow the view of Beit Shammai who taught (Menachot 40a) that linen garments are exempted from tzitzit.  They held that since a linen garment could never have t'chelet on it because of sha'atnez (as t'chelet must always be wool for the dye to absorb properly, which is the Torah's intention), even white linen strings are not put on.  This is what they meant when they said that Beit Shammai exempts linen in tzitzit, but the law does not follow them.  They did not derive laws from adjacent verses, but we follow Beit Hillel who did, and they therfore held that there is no problem of sh'atnez in tzitzit, as the Torah says, “Do not wear sha'atnez.  Make fringes for yourself” (Deut 22:11).  This implies that you may make your tzitzit from ?sha'atnez, and Beit Hille therefore believed that linen garments are obligated in tzitzit, and the law follwos them.  Still, we do not put t'chelet on a linen garment due to a concern about indigo, that is, lest a non-t'chelet dye be used and then it would be sha'atnez without the performance of a mitzvah.  The Talmud asked why it is not enough for the white strings to be the fulfillment of the mitzvah?  That is, even if it is indigo the sha'atnez problem is still surmounted by the white strings, as it is acceptable to use tzitzit that are sha'atnez!  They answered that Beit Hillel permitted sha'atnez in tzitzit on the strength of the verse only in cases where there are no alternatives, e.g. placing wool t'chelt in a linen garment, which is necessarily a combination of wool and linen.  In such cases Beit Hillel rely on the verse and obligated the use of t'chelet in a linen garment.  If however, there are other options, such as a case where one wishes to use white strings without t'chelet in a linen garment, it is not acceptable to use wool on the strength of the verse, as those white strings can be made of linen.  This follow the principle of Reish Lakish who said that in any case where it is possible to maintain both the positive and negative commandments it is ideal, an only otherwise do we say that the positive commandment supersedes the negative.  In this case it is possible to  maintain both commandments, for if you do not wish to place t'chelet with the white, linen suffices, and if you elect to use wool you have violated the law of sha'atnez and nothing else.  Because there are many interpretations of this discussion I have spent some time on it, and from what I found in my trap I have set the table for you.  If you merit you will understand the truth, and if you perhaps find valid reason to challenge my words in this matter my son you should not mind the honor of your father, and I will then read your destruction of the building.", 
                "Realize that even though the Torah only requires this mitzvah from one who wears a four cornered garment, like the requirement to build a fence that only applies to a person who has a roof, the Sages still extolled the value of this mitzvah and said (Menachot 41a) that one should pursue.  They also said (Shabbat 32b) that a person who is careful in the fulfillment of this mitzvah will merit to be waited upon by many servants, as the Torah equated it to and depended upon it the fulfillment of all the other mitzvot, as it says, “And you will see it and remember all the mitzvot of HaShem.”  Rabbi Elazar said that one who is careful in this and teffilin and mezuzah is assured that he will never sin, as it is written, “The three fold thread will not easily break” (Ecc. 4:12).",

Other views hold that they do recite the blessing.  One who transgressed and wore  his own wool or linen garment that meets the size requirements above without tzitzit has failed to fulfill this positive commandment.  If it is made from other materials he has failed to fulfill a rabbinic commandment.  If it is not his own garment but is instead borrowed, it is exempt for the first thirty days of the loan, and is obligated from the thirtieth day forward."

                "We are not to  follow the whims of our heart and the lusts of our eyes as it is written, \"Do not stray after your hearts and your eyes.\" (Num. 15:39)  The general sense of this commandment is that we should not dedicate our thoughts to the pursuit of ideas that are antithetical to the ones on which the Torah is built, as that may lead one to apostasy.  If, however, the the desire to pursue these thoughts should arise, one should try to resolve them cursorily, and redouble his efforts to contemplate the true and good ways of the Torah.  Similarly, a person should not pursue the things that one sees, principally meaning earthly desires, for in the end they are all evil and 'there is much shame and wrath.'  The Sages expressed this in their statement (Berachot 12b), \"'Do not stray after your hearts' refers to apostasy.  'After your eyes' refers to licentiousness, as it is written, 'And Samson said to his father, 'Take her for me, as she is right in my eyes.' (Jud. 14:3)\"", 
                "The root of this mitzvah is clear, as it protects a person from sinning against HaShem for all his days.  This mitzvah is really a fundamental principle in our religion, as evil thoughts are the antecedent to impurity, and the actions are their descendants.  If a person dies before having children their is no record of the progeny, so it emerges that this prohibition os the root of all good that comes from it.  Understand my son, and let it be your slogan, that the Sages said, \"One sin leads to another, and one mitzvah leads to another\" (Avot 4:2).  If you allow yourself to fulfill your evil fantasies even one time, you will inevitably do so many times.  If you merit to be a hero in the land and to conquer your evil inclination and close your eyes to the evil sights even one time, it will be easier for you to do so many times.  Lust pulls the body like wine draws the drinker. Drunkards can never be sated by wine, and they always want more, and the more they give in to their urge the stronger the urge becomes.  If they would drink some water it could extinguish their fire of desire and make it bearable for them.  The same is true here: The more a person allows himself to be governed by his urges and to allow them to become habit, the stronger his evil inclination becomes.  And the more he avoids them and appreciates what he has each day, he will see that HaShem made people the right way and that all of their schemes are completely pointless.",

One is not flogged for this because there is no specific deed for which the transgressor be can be warned, as people are made in such a way that it is impossible for them to see only exactly what they need, and similarly to never overreach in their speculations, so it is impossible to define precisely what the boundaries for conduct should be.

If the fetus is not developed enough to make the mother impure the next son is a firstborn.  In Tractate Niddah (Niddah 21a) this distinction is explained, and in Tractate Bekhorot the Sages describe which firstborn children are considered first for inheritance and which are first for the Kohen.

This mitzah is the responsibility of the father (Kiddushin 29a).  If the father refused to redeem him, the mitzvah devolves upon the son, who then must redeem himself when he becomes an adult.  The amount of the redemption is five Selah, whether it be in cash or commodities (though property rights are insufficient, i.e. land and slaves are not satisfactory).  The five Selah may be given to one Kohen or to several Kohanim, and the obligation is to give it to a male Kohen as the verse says 'Aharon and his sons' in the context of redeeming the firstborn.  If the Kohen wishes to return the redemption money after it is given he may do so, so long as the money is not given with this stipulation in mind.  If he did give the money with this condition the son is not redeemed until he gives it as a full gift.  If he specified that the money was given with the condition that it be returned, and the Kohen was appeased by the child is redeemed.",

(Gen. 2:7).  He clothed him with flesh and skin, and surrounded him with bones and ligaments, as it written, He clothed me  with flesh and skin and covered me with bones and ligaments' (Job 10:11).  He appointed food and drink for him, honey and milk to bring him joy, and appointed to angels to protect him in his mother's womb, as it is written, 'with life and kindness ..' (Job 10:12).  His mother says, 'this is my firstborn, with which HaShem opened the walls of my abdomen' and his father says, 'this is my firstborn and I am commanded to redeem him, as it is written, \"and all the first born of your sons you shall redeem\" (Ex 13:13)'.  May it be Your Will that as You have allowed this father to merit to redeem this child, may he also merit to [bring him] to Torah, marriage, and good deeds.  Blessed are You HaShem, who sanctified the first born of Israel to be redeemed.\"  The father then makes two blessings, 'on the redemption of the first born\" and \"You have allowed us to live\".  He then gives the specified redemption to the Kohen, the five Selah as established in the Torah.  This is equal to 60 argintz of pure silver in our land.  After the redemption, the Kohen recited the aforementioned three blessings.", 
                "Ramban also wote that when the father gives the money to the Kohen he should first place the child in the Kohen's hand, and the Kohen should say, \"Which to do value more highly, you son or or these five Selah?\"  The father responds that he prefers his son.  The Kohen then takes the money and passes them over the head of the son and says, \"this is in the place of this, traded for this, rendered no longer sacred through this.  This is for the Kohen and this child should grown to life and Torah and fear of heaven.  May it be His will that as this one has come to be redeemed may he also attain Torah, marriage and good deeds, and let us say Amen.\"  The Kohen then places his hands on son on blesses him as he knows how, such as \"may HaShem guard you ...\" or \"With long days and years of life ...\" or \"may HaShem protect you from all evil and guard your soul.\"  He then dismisses him to pursue whatever his pursuits may be.

One who did not redeem his son at the proper time, that is after 30 days, if he dies before he is redeemed he has failed to fulfill this mitzvah, and woe unto him for he carries his sin with his soul.

Today (when there is no Temple), since it is destined to be eaten the Kohen may sell it, even though it is unblemished, to a kohen or an Israelite.

They are truly given.\" (Num. 3:9)  Since the Kohanim are the primary doers in the service of HaShem they receive 24 gifts that are described in the verse and enumerated by the Sages (Chullin 133b): ten in the Temple, four in Jerusalem, and ten elsewhere.  The rest of the tribe that is chosen to assist Aharon is also given a life of luxury without toil through the produce tithes that they receive from all Israel.  To encourage them to contemplate that all of their portion, and that of their brethren, is due to their service of HaShem, they are commanded to give a tenth of all they receive from Israel to the 'greater ministers'.  This will remind them that someone is above them, and One is above all of them, He Who Guards All.  This also has a dignifying effect for the Levites as it allows them to participate int he mitzvah of giving tithes.  No future generations will be able to say, 'We get the mitzvah and you get the grain.\"  They will all say that they have 'Torah and flour.'", 
                "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages taught (Beitzah 13a) that a if a Levite received sheaths as tithes he should not give sheaths to the Kohen, but he is 'fined' with the responsibility of threshing and winnowing, and tithing the resultant grain, excluding  straw byproduct.  If he [illegitimately] tithed the sheaths, he includes the straw in his calculation, and then he must thresh and winnow and give it all.  They also said (Mishnah, Terumot 11:8) that only volumes greater than 1/64 of a log must be given to the Kohen.  If the volume is less than this he need not be bothered to give it to the Kohen, but he should simply burn it.  They also said (Mishnah, Bikkurim 2:5) that this tithe need not be taken from proximate material, as it is written, \"From all the tithes that you gift\" (Num. 18:28), that is, even if you have a tithe in one country and another in another country, you may take one gift form all of them.  Still, the Sages taught (Gittin 30a) that scholars would only take it form proximate material.  Many other details are explained in tractates Terumot, Ma'asrot, and in parts of Demai.",

                "We are commanded to burn the red heifer so that its ashes will be ready for anyone who needs to be purified after contact with the dead as it is written, “Speak to the Children of Israel and they shall take a red heifer” (Num. 19:2), and “It will be a safeguard for Israel.” (Num. 19:9).  Even though I have attempted to write simple reasons for the other mitzvot, as the purpose of this work is to instruct my son and his friends, on this mitzvah I am unable and wary of saying anything at all.  I have seen that the Sages spoke at length on the complexity and mysteriousness of this mitzvah to the point that they said that King Solomon, who who through his great wisdom was able to understand all the mitzvot, wrote about this, “I have sought wisdom, but it is far from me.” (Ecc. 7:23)  They also wrote in the Midrash: Rabbi Yosi B'rebbi Chanina said, “HaShem said to Moshe, 'To you I will explain this mitzvah, but not to others.'”  There are many other similar statements.  Do not think that the mystery is that the ashes affect purification, as that is similar to the process for the person with a gonerheal discharge or a new mother, whose purification is completed by the offering of a sacrifice.  ", 
                "The real surprise, so far as I have heard, is that the ashes purify the impure, yet they render impure those involved in the preparation. Even though the same is actually true for all burnt cows and goats, those ashes do not purify.  It is also surprising that the preparation is done outside of the camp, unlike other offerings.  On this point the non-Jews have a claim against Israel, as they believe that it is offered to the demons, as is their practice today.   Indeed many medicinal herbs, from the Lebanon cedar to the common hyssop weed operate in opposite ways.  They heat the cold and cool the hot.  If we understood the nature of the body and spirit and the causes of illness and health we would perhaps also understand how the heifer can sicken the soul and render impure those who are involved in burning it, and how it is that when it is ashes it heals the sickness of impurity.  It is not cleat that this would yield any result, but the love of the sacred and the desire to understand the hidden has moved the quill to write.", 
                "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages taught the heifer had to be three or four years old, though older is also acceptable.  They would not take a calf and raise her to maturity; they would always take a full grown heifer, as it says, “And take a heifer” (Num. 19:2).  The need for it to be “perfect” is that it be perfectly red, and two black or white hairs disqualify it.  If it was different shades of red it is acceptable, as it does not need to more perfect than other offerings.  If it had hairs whose roots were red and the tips were another color, we always look at the roots, and the hair is trimmed down to red part. ", 
                "Working the animal is prohibited as it is written,”that has bourne no yoke.”  Any labor is considered equivalent to yoking, therefore the Sages taught that even if it was used to carry a coat it is disqualified.  If, however, it needed to be guarded and it was tied to a post it is acceptable, but if it was unnecessary it is disqualified, as anything that is not done for its sake is a burden.  It was purchased with money from the general collection.  A heifer that became blemished can be redeemed and made de-consecrated.  They also taught that the one who burns the heifer becomes impure, as does the one who assists in the process, such as the person who turns over the carcass, or adds firewood, or blows the flame or stokes the coals, but the person who lights the fire, or arranges the wood is pure, as is anyone who deals with the ashes.  ", 
                "The Sages greatly enhanced the stringency of the preparation of the heifer. They would separate the Kohen who would burn it for seven days in a manner similar to separation that the Kohen Gadol would endure before Yom Kippur, as we know from tradition.  Each day they would sprinkle him with existing ashes, and this would be done by someone who had never experienced impurity in his life, as the sprinkler must be pure.  You might wonder why they could not have simply used someone who had been impure and subsequently purified.  This would not have been adequate, as there was the possibility that the person may have not been purified by a pure person.  Also, any vessels that wee filled to be poured on the Kohen who would burn the heifer were all stone, so that they are not susceptible to impurity.", 
                "You might ask how we could ever find such a person?  The Sages taught that they would … ",

                "The mitzvah applied in Israel when the Temple stood, and it is one of the mitzvot that we described in the introduction as applying to the congregation as a whole.  Our Sages taught that there were only nine heifers in history from the time the mitzvah was given until the destruction of the Second Temple.  The first was prepared by Moshe, the second by Ezra, seven from Ezra until the end of the destruction of the Temple, and the tenth will be prepared by the Messiah, many he come speedily in our days.  As this is a major feature of our religion as it purifies from the most severe impurities, and without it is impossible to for one who has contact with the dead to bring the Paschal Offering (which is a very great mitzvah), the common practice is to read this section each year on the week before Parshat HaChodesh, which is always read on the Shabbat before Nissan."

                "We are commanded to adjudicate matters of inheritance, that is, that we must rule in matters of inheritance according to the laws of the Torah, as it is written, \"When a man dies and has no son, you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter.  If he has no daughter, etc.\"  (Num. 27:8-9).  The end of the section says, \"And this shall be for the People of Israel as an eternal law, as HaShem commanded Moshe.\"  Do not think that the mitzvah means that a person must give his heirs his property in all cases, for HaShem did not wish to extract property from a person and give it to his heirs for as long as he is alive.  That is the view of the secular scholars, but we are taught that the rights of the heir are entwined with the property of the estate, and when the rights of the estate owner are revoked by death, the rights of the heir become active, in the manner of the continuous chain that HaShem devised for this.  Our Sages referred to this right of assertion of inheritance as 'touching' as in their statement, \"Inheritance touches and continues\" (Bava Batra 115b).  This means that the heir and the estate holder are like two bodies in contact with each-other, such that when one departs the other take its place.", 
                "Because of this the Sages taught (Bava Batra 126b) that if the estate holder says that he wishes to disinherit his son or daughter, or that his daughter should inherit instead of his son, or anything similar, his words are irrelevant, as he has no power to change the Word of HaShem concerning inheritance.  Even though we said that a person owns his property for all purposes, to give whatever he wishes to whomever he wishes, even to destroy his property, this is an exception, as this statement counter-indicates the words of HaShem and His laws.  HaShem determined which heir precedes, and a person has no power to change that.  This is reflected in the Mishnah (Bava Batra 130a), \"One who says, “So-and-so, who is my firstborn, shall not receive a double portion,\" [or] “So-and-so, my son, shall not inherit with his brothers,\" has said nothing, for he has stipulated against what is written in the Torah. Rabbi Yohanan ben Baroka says: If he refers to one who is qualified to inherit from him, his words are valid, but if he refers to one who is not qualified to inherit from him, his words his words are not valid.”\"  This means that if he selected on son among his sons daughter among his daughters to inherit the entire estate, it stands.  This is derived in the Talmud from the verse, \"And on the say that he gives his inheritance to his sons\" (Deut. 21:16), which implies that the Torah gav the father permission to select among his potential heirs.  The law is decided according to the view of Rabbi Yochanan for most cases, but not for the first born; the father has no power to disinherit the firstborn in this way.", 
                "They also said (Bava Bata 126b) that if a perosn divides his property and gives a large portion to one and a small portion to another, or is he gives a standard portion to the first-born, his words are valid.  If he did so using the term 'inheritance' it is not valid.  If at any point he referred to it as a gift, his words are valid.  It seems that even though his words are invalid when he uses the term inheritance, and no relevant action will be taken (as is explicit in the Mishna), through this command he has negated the positive commandment associated with inheritance, for he has trangressed the command of the king.  Also, if after he dies the court affirms his statements, they have similarly negated this mitzvah, in addition to transgressing the negative commandment of perverting justice.  It seems from Rambam that the thrust of this mitzvah is really for the court that will judge these matters, as he wrote, \"It is commanded to judge matters of inheritance\" and he explains on the mitzvah of annulling vows.", 
                "From the root of the mitzvah: A person should consider that the world is controlled by an authority who is concerned for His creations, and it is His will that apportions to each person the possessions that he attains in this world.  The gifts that He gives were intended to stay with those who received them, were it not for the Original Sin that brought death to the world.  Yet the death of an individual body should not end the gifts that HaShem had given, but they should propogate on their own to the body that extends from this one, i.e. a son or daughter.  If some misfortune causes him to die without children, it is proper for the blessing of HaShem to revert to some other relative, as this blessing was either due to his own merit or that of his forebearers, or perhaps his close relatives taught him some skill that caused him to amass wealth.  Therefore when he dies without children it is reasonable for his relatives who assisted him in this merit to precede all other people.", 
                "From the laws of the mitzvah:  The Sages taught the order of inheritance in the Mishna (Bava Batra 115a), that a son precedes a daughter, and all offspring of a son precede a daughter, daughter before brothers, and all offspring of a daughter before brothers.  Brothers and sisters (if there are no borhters) precede uncles, and uncles and aunts (if there are no uncles) precede other relatives.  The general rule is that the offspring of any heir precedes the next relation, and the father always precedes his offspring, and in this way we continue until the beginning of the lineage.  Therefore, there is not anyone in Israel who was no heir.", 
                "The Sages also taught (Bava Batra 108a) that a mother does not bequeath her property to her children, and maternal aunts do not inherit from each-other, as maternal family is not called family.  A mamzer does inherit like other sons, and even a mazer's child that become an apostate inherits, but a child of a maid-servant or non-Jewess does  not inherit as he his not the father's son for any purpose.  The Sages established that a wife would inherit her husband's property if they are fully married, and they linked this to a verse in the Torah.", 
                "Maimoniders wrote that part if these laws id that the first-born receives a double portion.  This means that if there are two brothers, we divide the property into three parts and the first born takes two.  If there are three brothers we divide it into four parts and the first-born takes two, and so forth.  The first-born only takes double in properties that are held by the father, that is, that were extant in the father's possession in his lifetime.  This is to exclude unpaid debts, as it is written, \"Of all that is found with him.\" (Deut. 21:17)  How does this work?  If one of the individuals from whom the father could inherit dies after the father, the first-born does not take double from that inheritance.  Or if the father had a debtor that owed him money, even if it was recorded in a contract, or if he has a merchant ship [raising revenue], the first-born does not take double, as these are not \"found with the father.\"  For the same reason the first-born does not take double of the profits that come from the properties, such as a field yielding grain, or trees bearing fruit, as these were not extant when the father was alive.  If, however, a small tree grew larger without direct input after the father's death, the first-born does take double of the value of the growth; this is considered extant as it is unchanged in form.", 
                "The father is trusted to identify which son is first-born (Kiddushin 74a), or to claim paternity (or non-paternity) of any child.  The Torah gave him this authority in the verse, \"He shall recognize his first born.\"  The Sages derived (Bava Batra 127b) from this that he can identify him for others, even if someone claims that he is Reuven's son, if Reuven denies it the son will not inherit.  Maimonides wrote, \"It seems to me that even if there are grandsons, such that the father is not believed for the purposes of family relationships  to render them mamzerim, he can still say that they will not inherit.", 
                "The Sages also taught (Bava Batra 129b) that if a person says to another, \"My property is yours and the remainder will be for another,\" if the first is eligible to inherit the latter has not claim.  Since the first gained rights to the property and is a legitimate heir, no further accounting of inheritance is needed.  According to the best explanations we learned that even if he says that this will take effect retroactively, that is, \"My property is yours, and after you so-and-so will have it from now,\" the latter still has no claim as the first is a legitimate heir.  If the first is not an heir and he formulates this retroactively, the latter has rights to the property itself, and the first one receives the income in his lifetime.  If he did not formulate it retroactively the latter only receives what is left from the first.  If the first sells the property the latter can never retrieve it from the purchaser, as they stay in the possession of the first for his entire life for all purposes, and he can sell or give them to anyone he chooses.  They are so fully in the possession of the first that if the initial formualtion was \"my property is yours, and then X and then Y\" then if X dies in the lifetime in the life of the first the Sages taught (Bava Batra 129b) that his heirs receive the property, as the original ceder of the property only stipulated that they would trnasfer from the first to X and then to Y, and since this is impossible, Y has no claim, and the only claimants are the heirs of the first.",

The soul that the Lord has given to us prevents us, to its ability, from sin. But as it resides here on earth, far removed from the boundaries of heaven, it is often unsuccessful, and the physical will often defeat it.  It therefore needs many guards to protect it from its malevolent neighbor, lest it rise up and kill it, as it is in its environs and under its control.  HaShem wanted to help us, the holy nation, and He commanded us to set up mighty guards around [the soul], and they are: the command to perpetually study Torah day and night, and to wear fringes on the four corners of our garments, and a mezuzah on our doorpost, and the tefillin on our arm and head.  All of this is to remind us to avoid the crimes that we can commit with our hands and to not stray after our eyes or the passions of our hearts.  Therefore, the Sages said (Zevachim 19a) that the Kohanim and Levites were exempt from these things when they performed the Temple service.   As the foundation of the tefillin is as we have said, we are also instructed (Menachot 36b) to not allow our thoughts to wander from them.

Even though the truth was with him because of his better explication over his colleagues who could not fathom his mind, and they did not concede to him even after the Bat Kol, and they brought a proof from the law set in the Torah that commands us to always go after the majority rule, whether they say the truth or whether they are mistaken. About this was the response of the Creator, blessed be He, \"My sons have defeated Me.\" Meaning, after they turned away from the true path, for Rabbi Eliezer had surmised the truth, and they came upon him from the power of the Torah commandments that commanded them to always listen to the majority, if so then, anyway one looks at it, this time one must concede to them as they said, [though] it lacks truth, for it is as if the \"Master of Truth\" had been defeated."

And when a man places his mind to this, he understands the ways of God and he will see that the continuous preservation of the species in the world - that not one of all of them became extinct and lost from the day they were created, 'from the lice's eggs to the antelope's horns' - is all from His statement and His will about this. And so too, will a man know that when he observes the commandments of his Creator and straightens all of his ways and be of clean hands and a pure heart, that the providence of God will be upon him and preserve his body for much time in this world, and his soul forever in the world to come. And like this did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Sotah 8a) [that] it is [payment] measure for measure, since when this person places his mind to that which existence and good are with God's providence over things - and not from another cause - he too merits that God should turn to him for the good and make him exist. And about the reward for the existence and the ability [given] since he believed in the Creator about this matter, they, may their memory be blessed, said in the midrash (Devarim Rabbah 80:5 on Ki Tetzeh) that a person merits children as a reward for this commandment, which is to say that his existence will continue, as children are the existence of a person and his memory. And they extrapolated this apparently from its stating, \"you shall surely send away the mother and the young (<i>banim</i>) you shall take for you,\" meaning to say, children (<i>banim</i>) take for yourself. As it could have stated, \"you shall surely send away the mother\" [only] and not [also] \"and the young you shall take for you.\" And about this root, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 33b) that we silence one who says in his prayer, \"Have mercy upon us, as You are the Merciful One, since Your mercies extend to the bird's nest,\" as the matter is not [one of] mercy, but rather it is in order to bring us merit in the way I have mentioned. And they said about this reason in the gemara there, \"It is because he makes the attributes of God into mercy, and they are [actually] only decrees.\" And the matter is not to say that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not have mercy, God forbid - as behold, He is called the Merciful One; and they, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 133b) [that] just like the Holy One, blessed be He, is merciful, you too have mercy.\" Rather, their intention is to say that there is no trait of mercy in Him, God forbid - like with people, [such] that the mercy in them is forced by their nature that the Creator, blessed be He, placed in them. But mercy for Him is from His simple desire - that His wisdom loves to have mercy, because it is a good trait, and all good traits are found with Him. And they said [that] in His commanding us about this, it was not by force of the trait of mercy that He commanded us in the thing, as behold, He permitted their slaughter, since all the species are created for the needs of man. But [rather] the command about this and about 'it and its son,' which is like it, and many other commandments are only like a decree in front of Him, since He decreed about it with His simple desire. And if He had wanted the opposite of this, nothing would force Him [to do otherwise] and no cause would prevent Him, God forbid. [This is,,] as opposed to us, who are built with the power of [our] natures, [such] that the trait of mercy impedes us from destroying, or sometimes forces us to do good. This is the matter of their saying [that] they are only decrees, and the root of the thing is about that which we mentioned.", 
                "And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote in explanation of this commandment (Guide for the Perplexed 3:48, and some have the textual variant, Ramban in his commentary to the Torah here) and of 'him and his child,' [that] it is because animals have great distress in seeing the pain of their children, like people. As the love of the mother for the child is not a matter that follows the intellect, but rather it is from the effects of the power of thinking that is found in animals, [just] as it is found in people. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote about this matter, \"Do not answer me with words from the statement of the sages [in] which they say, 'To the bird's nest, etc.' since this is the reasoning of the one to whom it appears that there is no explanation for the commandments, except for them being the will of the Creator. But we maintain the second reasoning, which is that there is an explanation for all of the commandments.\" And [Ramban] challenged him from that which is found in Bereishit Rabbah 44a, \"And for what would the Holy One, blessed be He, care if an animal is slaughtered from the [front of the] neck or from the back? Behold, the commandments were only given to refine the creatures with them, as it states (Proverbs 30:5), 'Every word of God is refined.'\"", 
                "<b>And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, answered the challenges and clarified the matter clearly, completely and nicely:</b> That matter which Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote that the commandments have explanations is something very elucidated, as in each one there is an explanation and a benefit and a refinement for a person, besides the reward for them from the Commander, may He be blessed. And they, may their memory be blessed, have already said (Sanhedrin 21b), \"For why did He not reveal the explanation of the commandments, etc.?\" And they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Pesachim 119a), \"'And to the clothed elegantly' (which can also be read as, 'and to the one that covers the ancient' Isaiah 23:18) - this is [referring] to the one who covers that which the Ancient of Days (God) covered. And what are they? The explanations of the Torah.\" And they have already expounded about the red heifer (Bemidbar Rabbah 19:6) that Shlomo said, \"I have discerned everything, but the section of the red heifer, I have investigated and asked and searched - 'I said that I could fathom it, but is far from me' (Ecclesiastes 7:23).\" And Rabbi Yossi Bar Chinanah said, \"The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, 'Go and I will reveal to you the explanation of the heifer, but to another, it will be a statute (that is not understood),' as it is written (Zechariah 14:6), 'In that day, there shall be neither sunlight nor cold moonlight' - things that are covered from you in this world, in the future you will gaze upon them in the world to come; like that blind man that becomes able to gaze, as it is written (Isaiah 42:16), 'I will lead the blind by a road they did not know.' And it is written (later in the same verse), 'I have done these words and I have not left them' - as I have already done them for Rabbi Akiva,\" meaning to say that Rabbi Akiva already knew them in this world.    ", 
                "Behold, they explained that the deterrent to our [understanding of] the explanations of the commandments is only from the blindness of our intellects; and that the explanation of the most difficult one of them was already revealed to the sages of Israel. And there are many such statements in their words - and in the Torah and in Scripture very many. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, mentioned some of them. But [as far] those homiletic teachings (<i>aggadot</i>) with which the teacher was challenged, according to [Ramban's] opinion, they are about a different matter: that they wanted to say that there is no benefit in the commandments to the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself, may He be blessed. Rather, the benefit is for the person, himself, to deter him from harm or a bad belief or an ugly trait or to remember wonders of the Creator, may He be blessed, [so as] to remember God. And this is [what was meant by] \"to refine them with them\" - that they should be like refined silver. As the action of the one who refines silver is not without explanation, but [rather] to remove all the dross. So too are the commandments to remove from him any bad belief and to inform him of the truth and to always remind him. And the language of the <i>aggadah</i> itself in Yilamdenu in the section, 'This is the animal ' (Midrash Tanchuma, Shmini 8): \"And for what would the Holy One, blessed be He, care if one  slaughters a beast and eats or stabs [it] and eats? Does it help Him or hurt Him at all?  Or what would He care whether one would eat pure foods or eat carcasses? 'And if you have been wise, you have been wise for yourself.' Behold, the commandments were only given to refine the creatures with them, as it states (Psalms 12:7), 'The words of the Lord are pure words; 'The word of the Lord is refined' (Psalms 18:31). Why? So that it will a shield for you.\"", 
                "Behold, it is shown by this that they are coming to say that there is no benefit to Him, may He be blessed, in the commandments - by way of illustration, that He would need the light that He commanded to light the candelabra (the menorah in the Temple) or that He would need the food of the sacrifices and the smell of the incense, as it would appear from their simple understandings. And even [regarding] the memory of His wonders that He commanded that we do [various acts] in commemoration of the exodus from Egypt and the creation story, the benefit is only that we know the truth and merit from it, such that we be fitting that they be a shield for us. As our honoring [Him] and saying over His praises are considered as nothing and void for Him. And he brought a proof from \"the one who slaughters from the [front of the] neck and from the back,\" to say that all of them are for us and not for the Holy One, blessed be He. As it is not likely to say about slaughter that there be a benefit and honor to the Creator, may He be blessed, from the neck more than from the back or from stabbing. But rather they are for us; to guide us in the paths of mercy even at the time of slaughter. And he brought another proof - \"or what would He care whether one would eat pure foods\" - and these are permitted foods - \"or eat impure foods\" - and these are forbidden foods, about which the Torah stated (Leviticus 11:26), \"they are impure to you\": they are only for you to be of clean souls, wise and understanding of the truth. And they said, \"And if you have been wise, you have been wise for yourself.\" They mentioned [the two examples], since the active commandments such as the slaughter [from] the neck are to teach us good traits; and the commandments and decrees regarding the species [that are permitted] are to purify our souls, as the Torah stated (Leviticus 20:25), \"and do not make your souls disgusting with the beast and the fowl and with all that crawls on the earth, which I have separated for you to be impure.\" If so, they are all for our benefit only. And it is as Elihou said (Job 35:6), \"If you sin, what do you do to Him? If your transgressions are many, how do you affect Him?\"; and (Job 35:7), \"What does He receive from your hand?\" And this matter is agreed to in all the words of our rabbis.", 
                "And they asked in Yerushalmi Nedarim 9:1 if we can open [an avenue of regret for a vow] with the honor of the Omnipresent in matters that are between him and the Omnipresent. And they answered this question [as follows], \"What is the honor of the Omnipresent [that is offended]? For example, a sukkah that [a man] does not make, a lulav that he does not hold, tefillin that he does not don? And that is [what is] understood by the honor of the Omnipresent? It is for [the person] himself that it helps, like that (Job 35:7), 'If you are righteous, what do you give Him; what does He receive from your hand?' [and] (Job 35:6) 'If you sin, what do you do to Him? If your transgressions are many, how do you affect Him?'\"", 
                "Behold, they elucidated that even the lulav and the sukkah and tefillin - that He commanded that they be 'a sign upon your arm and a commemoration between your eyes, that the Lord took you out of Egypt with a strong hand' - are not for the honor of God, may He be blessed, but [rather] to have mercy on our souls. And they already set this into the prayer of Yom Kippur, \"You have separated man from the start and recognized him to stand in front of You, as who will say to You what to do, and if he is righteous, what will he give to You?\" And so [too], it stated in the Torah (Deuteronomy 10:13), \"for your good\"; and so [too] (Deuteronomy 6:24), \"And He commanded us to do all of these statutes [...], for our good all of the days.\" And the intention in all of them is that it be good for us and not for Him, may He blessed and elevated; but all that we are commanded is [so that] our souls be refined and purified without the dross of evil thoughts and disgusting character traits. And so that which they said (Berakhot 33a), \"[It is because] he makes the traits of the Holy One, blessed be He into mercy and they are only decrees,\" is to say that God did not worry about the nest of the bird and His 'mercy did not reach' it and its child; as His mercy does not extend to creatures with an animal soul, to prevent us from doing what we need to them. As were it so, slaughtering would be forbidden. But [rather], the reason for the proscription is to teach us the trait of mercy and that we not become cruel. Since cruelty spreads in the soul of a man, as it is known with butchers that slaughter large oxen and donkeys, that they are 'people of blood,' 'slaughterers of men' [and] very cruel. And because of this they said (Kiddushin 82a), \"The best of butchers are the partners of Amalek.\" And behold, these commandments with animals and birds are not mercy upon them, but [rather] decrees upon us, to guide us and to teach us the good character traits. To here are the interpretations of Ramban, may his memory be blessed.",

As behold you see with your eyes that the opinion of both of them is that there are explanation for the commandments of the Torah [that show how] they benefit people's traits to make them more proper and to accustom them to better all of their actions through them; and that there is no benefit in their performance - God forbid - to the Creator, blessed be He. And if, however, there are from the commandments that we did not [fully] grasp their explanation due to the smallness of our intellect, because of their great depth and ultimate greatness, we should not prevent ourselves from saying about them all that we have grasped to find the benefit that there is for man in his doing them. And this is my path in all of my speech in this book - that there is a benefit for us found in the commandments; but there is not [benefit] for the One who commands them. And if you put your heart to these words, you will find this intention in all of them. And I have toiled greatly in some of them to succeed with the poverty of my mind to see a small little [part] of the great benefit that is in them. And I have written it on each and every one, 'and this is my portion from all of my toil.'", 
                "From the laws of the commandment are what they said, may their memory be blessed (Chullin 139b), \"'If you chance upon a bird's nest in front of you on the path' - just like the path which is not acquired by you; so too all, etc. From here they said, 'Doves from the coop and doves from the attic that nested in cubicles and in edifices, and geese and chickens that nested in an orchard, [one is] obligated in sending away; but [if] they nested within the house, and also Herodian doves, [one is] exempt from sending away. [...And] Rav Yehuda ... said, '[If] he found a nest in the sea, [he is] obligated in sending away,'\" as it is included in the expression, 'on the path,' \"as it states (Isaiah 43:16), 'So said the Lord, who makes a path in the sea.'\" And (Chullin 12:3) \"[If] it was flying - [...if] its wings do not touch the nest, one is exempt from sending. [...If] there were[...] damaged eggs, one is exempt from sending, as it states (Deuteronomy 22:6), '[...] young birds or the eggs' - just as young birds are viable, so too [the] eggs [must be] viable [to fall under the law...] If one sent her away and she returned,[...] - even [several] times - one is obligated [to send her away again], as it states (Deuteronomy 22:7),' You shall surely send.'\" And the rest of the details of the commandment are elucidated in the last chapter of Chullin.

And if the mother died before he sends her away or another person sent her away, he has no remedy to fulfill the positive commandment and to remedy the negative commandment. But if he sent her away before she dies, [the violation of] its negative commandment is rectified, as this negative commandment is rectified by the positive [one], and [it is] as we have written (Sefer HaChinukh 544) about the negative commandment that comes on this, with God's help."

And included in this commandment is to build and fix every wall and fence from which it is likely that there come an accident from it. And that which verse mentioned \"for your roof,\" is [because] the verse spoke in the present (using the most common example). And the language of Sifrei is \"'And you shall make a parapet' is a positive commandment\" (see Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 184).", 
                "About the roots of the commandment are that since even though God, may He be blessed, supervises the details of people's [lives] and knows all of their deeds, and [that] everything that happens to them - good or bad - is through His decree and His commandment according to their merit or their guilt, and like the matter that they, may their memory be blessed, said (Chullin 7b), \"A man does not [so much as] bruise his finger below (i.e. on earth), unless it is so ordained by above (in Heaven)\"; nonetheless a person must guard himself from the accidents that are customary in the world. As God created His world and built it upon the foundations of the principles of nature and decreed that fire should burn and that water puts out the flame. And so too, nature requires that that if a large stone falls on the head of a man, that it will smash his brain; or that if a person falls from the top of a high roof to the ground, that he will die. And He, may He be blessed, graced the bodies of people and blew into them a living soul with a mind, to protect the body from all incidents, and [then] placed the two of them - the soul and the body - within the sphere of the [natural] elements, and [these elements] will move them and act upon them. And since God subjugated the human body to nature - as so did His wisdom require - from the angle of its being physical, He commanded him to guard [himself] from an accident. As nature, to which he is subjugated, will act upon him if he does not guard himself from it. ",

And at their start, nature was master over them and at their end - due to the greatness of the elevation of theirs souls - 'it was reversed,' as they were the masters over nature. As we know with Avraham, our father, that they dropped him into the fiery furnace and he was not injured; and [with] the four (and [with] the three) pious ones mentioned that they placed 'into the burning fiery furnace[...] and [not] a hair on their head was singed.' But most people have not merited this great level due to their sins, and therefore the Torah command us to guard our dwelling places and our locales, lest death encounter us in our negligence. And we should not endanger our souls by reliance upon miracles; and they, may their memory be blessed, said (Sifra, Emor 8) that a miracle is not performed for anyone who relies on a miracle. And according to this approach will you see most matters written in every place. Since even in Israel's fighting of a war commanded by the word of God, they would [still] organize their war and equip themselves and do all of the [required] matters, as if they were completely relying on natural processes [to win the war].

And the proof that there is a negative commandment in it, is that it is written in its prevention, \"lest (<i>pen</i>).\" And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Eurvin 96a) that in every place that it states, \"guard yourself,\" \"lest,\" and \"do not\" (<i>heeshamer, pen ve-al</i>), it is certainly a negative commandment. ", 
                "About the roots of the commandment, [there is a need for a] preface: The matter is known that in all of the commandments of the Torah, God distances us form a thing according to [the degree] of the stumbling found in it. And there is no doubt that the planting of a vineyard is the cause of wine, which [brings] several stumbling blocks to people. From its desire have fallen many casualties, since [wine] stimulates the 'impulse of the heart of man which is evil' and it pushes off the good impulse. And all of its counsel is, \"Eat, drink and lay down to fall asleep.\" And [it is] like the matter that is written (Habakuk 2:8), \"And surely the one that wine betrays,\" and the one who separates from it is called holy. And nonetheless God, may He be blessed, allowed it to us because of its slight purpose for bodies that its found in its slight [consumption]. And since it is only permitted for a great need, the verse obligated us that if also the start of its planting or its seeding will be in such a way that there is an angle of iniquity and sin in it, that we not keep it and that we should not benefit from it at all, but that it should all be burnt and destroyed from the world. Are all of the stumbling blocks that come out from at it after the end of its ripening not enough for us? [Hence,] it is not good for also its beginning to be in sin, but [rather] all of it should be incinerated, the fruit and the chaff and the wood and everything that is in it.", 
                "From the laws of the commandment are that which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Kilayim 5:5), \"Whether one plants, or whether one keeps a forbidden mixture in his vineyard\" - meaning to say that he saw that a forbidden mixture grew in his vineyard and he left it there - \"it has become set aside,\" meaning it became obligated to be burnt. And that is when they were standing in the vineyard by his will, once he knew about them, in the measure that they increased one two-hundredth from what they were at the time that he knew about them. As they, may their memory be blessed, said (Pesachim 25a), \"[If] it is planted from its start, with the taking root; [if] it has already been planted and increased, with the [further] increase.\" And, they, may their memory be blessed, explained from the tradition that this increase is one two-hundredth. And that which we say that they have not become set aside unless he wants their existence is because it is written about them, \"which you have planted\" - meaning to say, according to his will. And the explanation for this thing is elucidated in the root of forbidden mixtures on inter-breeding and of witchcraft that I have written in their place in the Order of Kedoshim (Sefer HaChinukh 244) and Mishpatim (Sefer HaChinukh 62). And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 100a), \"[If the] partition of the vineyard is breached (such that a forbidden mixture is created), we say to him, 'Fix [it].'\" [This] means to say that even though it increased one two-hundredth while he was still attempting to make the fence, it did not become set aside; since it did not become breached, and it did not stay breached, according to his will. And so [too] they, may their memory be blessed, said that one who suspends his grapevine over the produce of his fellow, behold, this one set aside his grapevine, but the produce did not become set aside (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 5:8). And for this reason, they also said that - since a person cannot set aside something that is not his - this prohibition is only [operative] by the will of the owners. And because of this, they also said that one who suspends the grapevine of his fellow over the produce of his fellow did not set aside any one of them. And for this reason, one who plants his vineyard on the seventh year did not set it aside, since in the seventh year the land is ownerless to everyone (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 5:8). And they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Kilayim 5:5) that one who plants vegetables or produce in a vineyard or leaves it until it increased one two-hundredth, behold, he has set aside sixteen ells in every direction around the grapevines. And one who comes to plant vegetables or produce next to a vineyard must distance it four ells from it. And five vines is called a vineyard, and this is when they are planted in this order: two across from two and one sticking out as a tail. And they said that we distance produce and vegetables three hand-breadths from a single grapevine in every direction, because the grapevine is soft and the roots of the produce go into it and there is in this a prohibition of [forbidden] grafting. But with other trees which are hard, this concern is not there and one does not need to distance [other plantings] from them at all. And the rest of the details of this commandment are explained in Tractate Kilayim. ", 
                "And this prohibition not to derive benefit from forbidden mixtures from the vineyard is practiced in the Land of Israel from the Torah, and outside of the land rabbinically. And there are those that say that outside the land, even though the prohibition of planting is practiced there, the prohibition of benefit is only specifically with the forbidden mixtures of the vineyard of the Land of Israel, and their words need support. And the one that transgresses this, and eats or derives benefit from a forbidden mixture of the vineyard of the Land of Israel, is obligated in [getting] lashes. And even one who eats it not in the way of its enjoyment - meaning to say, he did not derive enjoyment from eating it - is obligated by it and is lashed; which is not the case with all other prohibitions in the Torah, in which we only give lashes for them [if they are consumed] according to the way of their enjoyment - meaning to say that the person derives enjoyment from them. [This is] as Abbaye says in the second chapter of Pesachim 24b, \"Everyone concedes about forbidden mixtures of the vineyard that we lash for them even not in the ways of their enjoyment. What is the explanation? Since it is not written about them, 'eating.'\" As it is written, \"lest it be set aside (<i>tikdash</i>)\" - and they, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Kiddushin 56b), \"Lest it be incinerated by fire (<i>tukad esh</i>).\" And outside of the land, one who eats or derives benefit from them transgresses a rabbinic prohibition, according to some of the commentators, as we said."

                "<b>Not to do work with two species of animals:</b> Not to plow with an ox and a donkey together. And the same is the case with any two species of animals, when one is pure and the other one is impure. And it is not specifically plowing that is forbidden, but rather the same is true for all types of work - for example, threshing or pulling a wagon [or] any of the types of work. And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 22:10), \"You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.\"", 
                "[Concerning] the root of the commandment, Rambam, may this memory be blessed wrote (Guide for the Perplexed 3:49, see also Ramban on Deuteronomy 22:10) that is it from the root of the prohibition of inter-breeding animals as a forbidden mixture. As the way of workers of the land is to to bring a pair (of animals) from one barn and lest [and there] he would graft them. And the root of the prohibition of inter-breeding I wrote in its place in the Order of Kedoshim Tihiyu (Sefer HaChinukh 244). And after permission of the master, the teacher mentioned, and concession to his good word, I will also answer my portion. And I say that from the explanations of this commandment is the matter of [causing] pain to animals, which is a prohibition of the Torah. And it is known that for species of animals and fowl, there is great anguish in dwelling with those that are not its species and, all the more so, to do work with them. And [it is] as we see with our eyes with the ones that are not under our hands (undomesticated species) that every bird dwells with its species; and all animals and other species also always cling to their [own] species. And any wise-hearted person will [learn] proper conduct from this, to never put together two people whose natures are different from one another and different in their behavior in any matter - like a righteous person and an evildoer [or] a slight person and an honorable one. Since if the Torah was exacting about the pain that there is to animals - that are not intelligent creatures - from this, all the more so [is this the case] with people that have an intelligent soul, in order to know their Maker.", 
                "From the laws of the commandment are what they, may their memory be blessed, said (see Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 218 and Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 9:7) that the obligation of this commandment from the Torah is only with two species like the ox and the donkey; that one of them is pure and the second one impure, [such] that their natures are very distant from one another. But with two species that are [both] pure or impure, like an ox and a goat, or a donkey and horse, it is not forbidden from the Torah. Rather it is [only] rabbinically that any two species that would [constitute a case of] forbidden inter-breeding are forbidden - and both [domesticated] beasts and [undomesticated] animals are included in the prohibition. And it is the same whether one plows with them or seeds or pulls a wagon with them. And so [too] if one [person] was sitting in the wagon and one was leading [them], both of them are lashed, because his sitting in the wagon [also] causes the animal to pull (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 9:9). And even if a hundred [people] led together, all of them are lashed. And [about] that which they said that it is permissible to do all work with a person and an animal, as it states, \"with an ox and a donkey\" - and not with a person and a donkey or a a person and an ox (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 9:10), the explanation of the matter is according to the root that we mentioned. As the joining of an animal is not distressing for a person, since there is not connection with it at all. And behold, it is like he is doing work with a tree or a stone, and [so] it does not at all come into the designation that we spoke about. And also from the matter of the commandment is that which Rabbi Yitschak said at the end of Makkot 22a, that one who leads an ox rendered unfit from sanctification is lashed - even though it is one body, the verse made it like two bodies to be lashed for. And the rest of its details are explained in the eighth chapter of Kilayim (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 297).", 
                "And this prohibition is practiced in every place and at all times, by males and females. And one who transgresses this, and seeds or plows or pulls or leads with a forbidden mixture - which are two species, one impure and one pure - is obligated in [getting] lashes from the Torah. And he is obligated in [getting] lashes even if he led them together with his voice alone - like the way of animals that sometimes walk with the coaxing of people, as it is stated, \"together\" - in any case. They, may their memory be blessed, made a precise inference from the words of the verse, to obligate lashes [even] with speech without a deed. And in [the case of] two species that were [both] impure or pure that would be forbidden interbreeding with each other, he is rabbinically obligated in [getting] lashes of insubordination. "

And he wrote further that this matter is still known with the priests that are in Egypt. ", 
                "From the laws of this commandment are what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 5b, and see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 10:2) that there is only a prohibition from the Torah of a combination of wool and flax if they are <i>shua, tavui</i> and <i>noz</i>. [This] is to say that the wool is <i>shua</i> by itself, meaning to say, beaten, and <i>tavui</i> (spun) by itself and  <i>noz</i> by itself - and the explanation of   <i>noz</i> is woven (see Rashi on Niddah 61b and Rabbenu Tam in Tosafot on Niddah 61b) - and so [too] is the flax <i>shua, tavui</i> and <i>noz</i>, by itself; and afterwards he combined them together - for example, he wove them, or even if he tied them one to another, once he tied two knots, this is <i>shaatnez</i> from the Torah, for which there is lashing. But the whole time that these three [processes] that we have written are not done to them, it is not <i>shaatnez</i> from the Torah, but [only] rabbinically, according to the opinion of some commentators, and we do not give lashes for it. But it is forbidden rabbinically if one of the the [processes] that we have mentioned - either <i>shua</i> or <i>tavui</i> or <i>noz</i> - is done to them. And this is what they, may their memory be blessed, said (Mishnah Kilayim 9:9), \"the ones alone are forbidden,\" meaning to say, rabbinically.

And they, may their memory be blessed, said this matter when the forbidden mixture underneath is soft, as then is there this concern of wrapping (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 5:12,13). And this prohibition is rabbinic, as from the Torah it is permissible, even when they are soft. And [it is] as they, may their memory be blessed, said, \"'It shall not come upon you' (Leviticus 19:19) - but you can set it under you\" (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 10:12,13). And in the Yerushalmi Kilayim 9:1, they said [that] pillows and comforters - even though they are hard - with full ones, it is forbidden to sit upon them rabbinically, since they double over on the one that is sitting upon them; but with empty ones ([this is what is written] in the Yerushalmi, [though there appears to be an error here in the Sefer HaChinukh, wherein it is written], the soft ones), since there is no concern that they will go on top, it is permissible to sit upon them, since (if) they are hard.  And the explanation of the matter is [that it is] because the verse forbids <i>shaatnez</i> with an expression of wearing, meaning to say in the way of wearing is it forbidden and not in another way. And for this reason our teacher, God protect him, permitted us to put hats that are made from felt on our head to guard against the sun, since they are also very hard. And therefore, even though they have a forbidden mixture in them, they permitted them, as it is not the way of wearing something so hard. And there is one who wants to be stringent upon himself with this, and they did not protest against him. And for this reason that it is the way of wearing that the Torah forbade, they also permitted the sellers of cloth to sell according to their way (to put the cloth on top of themselves) but only when they do not have any intention at all to warm up from it. And nonetheless, the modest and good wholesalers extend clothes from forbidden mixtures on a stick behind them, so that they not touch them. And they, may their memory be blessed, said that there is no measurement to forbidden mixtures - that even one string in a large garment forbids all of it until he removes it (see Mishneh Torah, Diverse Species 10:5). <i>Kelech</i> - which is a type of wool and it grows on stones in the Dead Sea - is forbidden with flax rabbinically, because of the appearance [of sin] (<i>marait ayin</i>).

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 22:13), \"If a man takes a woman and has sexual relations with her,\" which is to say [that] if a man wants to take (marry) a woman for himself, he should acquire her first with sexual relations.

And there is no obligation for the fine until she is a full three years old; but from three full years to when she matures, there is a fine for her.

Hence, this warning about them came to us that we should not prevent ourselves from marrying them. Since the subjugation that they subjugated us was a decree upon us from God, it is not fitting that we fix a hatred in our hearts about it. And they are called our brothers in their converting and coming to be shielded under the wings of the Divine Presence.

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 23:18), \"No daughter of Israel shall be a prostitute.\" And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 355) and this is his language: \"The negative commandment about this matter has already been duplicated with a different language in the verse (Leviticus 19:29), 'Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot' - and the [following is the] language of Sifrei Kedoshim 7:3, '\"Do not desecrate your daughter\" - this is one who gives over his unattached daughter not for the sake of marriage and also [a woman] who gives herself over not for the sake of marriage.' And hear from me for what [reason] this negative commandment of strong language was duplicated, and for what was it added to (see Mishneh Torah, Virgin Maiden 2:17): That which He already made precede from His laws that one who has sexual relations with a virgin - whether it be a seduction or a rape - is not obligated any one of the punishments, except only to [give] money and to marry the woman with which he had sexual relations, as it is explained in the verse, would let it come into our thoughts that since this thing only requires the payment of money, that this law goes according to the procedure of financial law. And [if so, just] like a person has the right to give whatever of his money to his fellow and he leaves it to him to do his will with that which is [now] his; so too has [the father] the right to take the maiden with him and to give her to a man to have sexual relations with her, since that is his law that is fitting to him - meaning to say the fifty shekel-coins of silver that go the father of the maiden. And this [father] will also give her on condition that he takes from him such and such dinar-coins. And he is prevented from this [thought] and it is told to him, 'Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot.' Since that which is My law with her to only take money, however, is only when there is an incident when a man seduces or rapes [her]; but when the matter is with the consent of both of them together and it is public, there is no permissibility to this at all from any angle. And He showed the explanation for this and stated (Leviticus 19:29), 'lest the land fall into harlotry and the land be filled with depravity.' [This is] since the existence of seduction and rape is limited, but when the matter would be by choice and consent, it would spread and fill the land. And this reason is very nice and it enhances the verse. And similar to this is all that which the sages have mentioned and all that they agreed upon regarding the Torah laws.\" To here is his language, may he be blessed. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed, tackled him on this (in his critique of Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 355) and said that this negative commandment of the prostitute is not coming to warn one having sexual relations without a wedding contract and betrothal, as the wedding contract is neither a commandment nor a form of acquiring a woman, at all, according to the Torah. But [rather] the main negative commandment [here] is coming to warn not to have sexual relations with a woman that is forbidden [in marriage] to the man having sexual relations in such a way that betrothal would not be effective for him with her. As they, may their memory be blessed, elucidated in the gemara (Yevamot 61a), that the harlot (<i>zonah</i>) that is mentioned in every place in the Torah is none other than a woman who an Israelite has sexual relations with, when betrothal would not be effective for him with her. And this is the harlotry that the Torah distanced and loathed forever and [here] it warned the [man] and the [woman] about it. And so too from the foundation of this matter is that the verse warns the court that they should not let a woman be abandoned among them, since her end will be to have sexual relations with men that she is forbidden to [in marriage], to the point that betrothal is not effective for them with her. As there is no doubt that a woman abandoned to the many will not be exacting afterwards 'between a piece of permissible fat and a piece of forbidden fat.' And so too does it warn the father of the girl about this explicitly in another verse; that he should not abandon her to harlotry and not to give her over to one who cannot have betrothal with her. And about this is it stated, \"Do not desecrate your daughter to make her a harlot.\" And it is all from the reason mentioned - since she will have sexual relations with one who she is forbidden to [in marriage]; not from the reason of marriage contract and betrothal, as is the opinion of Rambam, may his memory be blessed.",

And because of this, is it stated in this language: \"No [daughter of Israel] shall be, etc.\" Since had the verse stated, \"There shall not be among you a male prostitute or a female prostitute,\" slaves would have been included in the category of the prohibition; since they are also obligated in the commandments, except for those places where they are excluded - when Israel is explicitly specified, as with stealing a soul, wherein it is written there, \"from his brother, from the Children of Israel. And so too, here, where it states, \"from the daughters of Israel\" and \"from the sons of Israel\" - it is implied that the warning is to Israel alone; not to the slaves. And about the matter of this prohibition about \"There shall not be a male prostitute,\" I have already written the disagreement that [exists] between the two sages mentioned there in the Order of Achrei Mot concerning the negative commandment of male cohabitation (Sefer HaChinukh 209), see there.",

But according to Ramban, may his memory be blessed, an unattached man and an unattached woman who have sexual relations are not obligated, except if she is sexually forbidden to him, to the extent that betrothal is not effective for him with her, as we have explained.

And if one gives her a sanctified animal as a gift, it does not become forbidden, as the holy realm already preceded and took possession of it. And what is the price of a dog?

But if [the gentile] stood [this Israelite] in front of the Israelite [lender] - even though the gentile gives the money to the hand of [the Israelite borrower] - since [the gentile] gave the money with the knowledge of the Israelite [lender], behold it is fixed interest (and forbidden). And they, may their memory be blessed, said  (Bava Metzia 70b and see Mishneh Torah, Creditor and Debtor 5:2) that even though their interest is permissible according to the [letter of the] law, it is [still] forbidden for an Israelite to lend to them with fixed interest, more than what he needs for his livelihood; so that he not be accustomed to always be with him and learn from his deeds. But it is permissible to take tangential interest (<i>avak ribit</i>), even if it is more than what he needs for his livelihood; since he will not be so accustomed to be with him for the sake of tangential interest. And a Torah scholar may lend whatever he wants, as there is no concern about him that he will learn from [the gentile's] deeds; since 'wisdom emboldens the sage and guards him forever.' And the rest of its details are elucidated in the chapter [entitled] Eizehhu Neshekh in Bava Metzia (see Tur, Yoreh Deah 159, 160).",

And one who transgresses it, and lends without interest from the perspective of kindness alone - not from the hope about him that he will profit from him from another angle, or because of the ways of peace - negates this positive commandment. And Ramban, may his memory be blessed (in his critiques of the sixth root and at the end of his critiques of the Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam) does not count this positive commandment in the count of the [613] commandments; and he says that this verse only came to give a positive [as well as] a negative commandment for one who lends to an Israelite with interest. And this is the intention of the midrash in Sifrei, in its saying that this is a positive commandment. And so does it appear from the words of the gemara at the end of the chapter [entitled] Eizehhu Neshekh. But with all of this, 'we walk in the way of the king' - 'we will not veer to the right or left' from [Rambam's] count. And great is the one whose mistakes are numbered (few in number). "

As this verse of \"what comes out of your mouth, etc.\" is stated about the matter of what a person obligates himself to God, may He be blessed, whether they be in matters of sacrifices or charity moneys, and that is what is stated, \"as He will surely demand it from you\" - which is to say, that He will seek from you the money that you vowed to Him - and your delaying it will be a sin. And so, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Rosh Hashanah 4a), \"The obligations of: one who promises his own value [to the Temple], or someone else's value [to the Temple], setting aside objects [for the Temple], sanctifying objects [for the Temple], [someone obligated in] sin sacrifices, guilt sacrifices, burnt sacrifices, peace sacrifices, charity monies, tithes, first-born and animal tithes, the Pesach sacrifice, gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and corner fields; once three pilgrim holidays passed by him, one violates 'do not delay.'\" But regarding everything that a person obligates himself to in optional matters - which the sages called, 'utterance (<i>bitui</i>),' and that is if he vows or swears, \"I will eat,\" or \"I will not eat,\" \"I will go to place x,\" or \"I will not go,\" and all that is similar to this - this does not come into the category of this commandment. And this is why the verse needed to promise, \"If you refrain from vowing, you will incur no guilt.\" And nonetheless, with vows of utterance, there is another commandment specified for it, and that is the section of the Torah about vows in the Order of Roshei HaMatot, where it is written (Numbers 30:3), \"taking an oath imposing an obligation on himself, he must carry out all that has come out of his lips\" - and they, may their memory be blessed, explained (Sifrei on Numbers 30:3) [that this is speaking about a vow] to forbid the permitted.", 
                "And another difference between vows of utterance and vows to the Elevated realm is that with vows to the Elevated realm there is no need to mention [the word,] 'vow' with them, but rather he says, \"This animal is a sacrifice,\" or \"This vessel is for the upkeep of the [Temple],\" or \"for the poor.\" And with this alone, he is obligated to fulfill the words of his mouth, by the positive and the negative commandment mentioned in this verse; such that if three pilgrim holidays passed and he did not fulfill his vows, he transgresses, 'do not delay.' But regarding, 'do not profane his words,' he only transgresses when he transgresses the vow in a way that it impossible for him to fulfill it ever. But concerning optional matters, he needs to mention 'vow' with them - or something that indicates it, for example, what they called 'hands of the vows (<i>yadot hanedarim</i>) or utterances.' But if he only said words, [such as] \"I will eat this loaf,\" or \"I will walk to place x,\" or \"I will give this portion to the rich Mr. x,\" he has not obligated himself in a positive commandment at all. [Still,] it is fitting for anyone who God has graced with intelligence to fulfill all of his words [evne in such a case]. And we say so [too] that he does not transgress, 'do not delay,' with vows of utterances - and even after several pilgrim holidays.",

And nonetheless, regarding the matter of not transgressing, 'do not delay,' we do not transgress until three pilgrim festivals have passed by one - as the Torah obligated more generally regarding all vows of the Heavens about 'do not delay' after three pilgrim holidays, and not before; and like the words of the bereita that I wrote abut this commandment adjacently. This is the opinion of some of the commentators. But there are some of them that said that we are obligated with charity, when he does not pay it immediately, even about 'do not delay.' And they said that there is a difference between what a person obligates himself in - for example, charity - and what a person does not obligate himself - like gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and corner fields. As with what he obligated himself to, and it is in his hand to fulfill - [something] that has these two [elements]; for example, charity - he is immediately obligated in 'do not delay.' But with gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and corner fields, he did not obligate himself to [do] them. And [with] sacrifices, in which he did obligate himself to [do] them, it is not in his hand to sacrifice them immediately - and therefore, he does not transgress for them until after three pilgrim holidays. Merit, my son, and you will examine their words.

But the one who is involved with what is attached - for example harvesting and reaping - only eats when he has finished his work. For example, the harvester and the reaper, would eat after they have filled the basket (see Mishneh Torah, Hiring 12:2). This is the law of the Torah, but the sages said [that] because of returning a lost object to the owner - meaning to say, that they not idle form work - that they should eat while walking form one row to another and in their returning [from the vat]. And one who idles during the time of work, and eats, transgresses a negative commandment. And about this is it stated, \"you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain,\" as we will write in this Order adjacently in its negative commandments with God's help (Sefer HaChinukh 577). And also that which they said about this matter (Bava Metzia 89a), that one who milks and one who churns and one makes cheese, and all that is similar to it does not eat, because [milk products] are not things that grow from the ground; [and] one who thins out onions or garlic - even though he detaches small ones from among the big ones - does not eat, because this is not the end of production; and it is not necessary to say that guardians of gardens and orchards and all that is attached to the ground do not eat at all. And [also] that which they said (Bava Metzia 89a) that the worker does not eat from something, the production of which is completed concerning tithing and challah-tithing. One who harvests and one who threshes and one who winnows and one who separates and one who reaps olives or grapes and one who crushes and all that is similar to these [types of] work eat from [the law of] the Torah. And the guardians of threshing floors and mounds and anything that is detached from the ground, the production of which has not been completed regarding tithes, eat from the laws of [what is practiced] in the state, but not from [the law] of the Torah, since a guardian does not do an act (see Mishneh Torah, Hiring 12:8,9). And with someone who does an act, there is no difference between when he does it with his hand or his foot or even with his shoulder - all of them eat from [the law of] the Torah. If he was involved with figs, he cannot eat grapes, as it states, \"in your neighbors' vineyard, and you may eat grapes\" - meaning to say, and not something else. And one involved in this grapevine should not eat grapes of a different vine. And it is forbidden for the worker to suck the grapes, as it states, \"and you may eat [grapes]\" - and not sucking. And he should not eat a gluttonous eating, as it states, \"and you shall be satisfied\" - but not more.

And for this reason, there are some of our rabbis that say in the gemara (Gittin 90a) that he can divorce her even if she burnt his cooked food - meaning to say, even for a small thing - since she is only like a valuable vessel in the home. And there are some of them that say that since this vessel is in His image and His likeness, and God granted to her - for his need and his honor - eyes to see, ears to hear and an intelligent soul, it is only fit for him to put her out and send her away from him for a large claim, and as the matter that is stated in the verse, \"because he finds something lewd about her.\" However, according to everyone, if he finds a big thing, it is fit for him to divorce her for the reason that I mentioned - since she was only created for his sake. And since she is a bitter spirit for him and his soul despises her, he is under no compulsion to be with her in any case (as do some of the nations, who make a covenant with a woman [that is] a strong covenant until [one of them reaches] the grave below; and [so] she does not fear separation if she is licentious in his eyes and destroys everything in the house and burns everything that he has with fire - from the heaps to the standing grain to the olive grove). Nonetheless, the Torah commanded us that when we send her away, that he not send her away with speech alone, lest this be a stumbling block for us and it become a snare - that there be licentiousness among our nation, such that the adulterer claim that her husband divorced her; and also that divorce be very prevalent. Accordingly,  now that we have been obligated to write the words in a book and to have witnesses testify, any [woman] that claims to be divorced, must show a contract [to that effect].

And [also] that he can give it into her courtyard, and she is divorced with that. And that is if she is standing in the midst of her domain, as the <i>get</i> is disadvantageous to her; and we have someone incur a disadvantage only in their presence. And that which they also said (see Mishneh Torah, Divorce 2:1-2) that that which it states in the Torah, \"and he writes her a book of cutting\" - the intention is not that he writes it with his hand. Rather it is one, whether he writes with his hand or he tells another to write and give it to her. And it is one whether he gives it into her hand or he says to another to give it to her. It is only written, \"he writes,\" to let us know that she is only divorced by writing. And it is only written, \"he gives,\" to say that she not take it on her own. And one who says to two [others], \"Write a <i>get</i> and sign it and give it to my wife,\" behold these can write and sign and give [it] to her - and behold, they are his messengers and they themselves are the witnesses.

And it is impossible for her to be a sexual prohibition today - [such] that one who has sexual relations with her is [subject to] death by the court - and tomorrow be permissible, without witnesses. And therefore they, may their memory be blessed, said that if he gave her a <i>get</i> between himself and herself - and even with one witness - it is not a <i>get</i> at all. And to what do these words apply? To the script of a scribe. But if the husband wrote it in his own script and one witness signed it, behold, this is an invalid <i>get</i>.

                "And we write, 'like the law of Moshe and Israel' on the last line, and the witnesses sign.", 
                "And the universal custom is to warn the man divorcing to nullify any [future] objection or objection of an objection (see Mishneh Torah, Divorce 6:20). And we say to him that he should say, \"Write this <i>get</i> for the sake of my wife x.\" And we place him there next to the scribe. And nonetheless, if he has gone after he ordered to write the <i>get</i> and to sign and to give it, we give it and we do not concern ourselves with [his possible death], as we place him under the assumption of [someone still] alive. And they, may their memory be blessed, warned us, that we should not write in the <i>get</i>, <i>veden</i>, with [a] letter, <i>yod</i>, lest the reader read [it as] <i>vedin</i> (and the law), and its understanding would be to say, the statute will be between you and me; and a <i>get</i> requires clear language [that is] void of doubt. And so too, they said not write <i>eegeret</i> with [a] letter, <i>yod</i>, lest the reader read [it as] <i>ee gart</i> (if you became a stranger), which would be to say, if you were unfaithful; and he should not write <i>lemechach</i> with [a] letter, <i>yod</i>, lest the reader read [it as] <i>lee michach</i> (it is laughable to me), which would be to say, it is laughter to me; and he should not write <i>tehavian</i> and  <i>tetsavian</i> ('shall be' and 'determine' in the singular) with two letters, <i>yod</i>, lest the reader read [it as] <i>tehavyena</i> and  <i>tetsavyena</i> (in the plural), which would be to say, that he is speaking to two women, and it comes out that that he is not divorcing this one, but rather two others. And so too, he should lengthen the [shape of the letter] <i>vav</i> in <i>tarukhin</i> and <i>shevukin</i> ('divorce' and 'left' in masculine), lest it resemble a <i>yod</i> and its understanding would be <i>tarikhin</i> and <i>shevikin</i> (in the feminine), meaning to say, that she left him. And in this manner, we must be careful with every expression and every [word] that is written in the <i>get</i>, such that it not be ambiguous (see Mishneh Torah, Divorce 4:13). And so too, the writer must be careful in the writing that the script be a lucid one, such that children who are not foolish but not wise can read it (see Mishneh Torah, Divorce 4:10). And he can write in any language and in any script, so long as the language and script are clear in the manner that we have mentioned. And Israel has already become accustomed to writing in the Aramaic language and the Ashuri (standard Hebrew) script (see Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 126:2).", 
                "And behold, my son, I will write a little of the text of general contracts. And even though this is not included in this commandment and its subject, the word, <i>get</i> that we have spoken about is a general word for all contracts, and [so] this is included in the word. Before anything, I will say that it is fitting for all proper witnesses to investigate and to understand the essence of the things to which they will testify, whatever the matter may be; and that they inform the involved parties to inform them of all the stipulations between them in a clear language, and to review all of the things in front of them until they comprehend them well. And [they should not act] like the foolish witnesses, who strip people of their cloaks and their possessions and their properties 'by the tail of their cloaks.' [The parties] whisper a little into the ears of the silly masses and, before they inform them [properly - such] that they understand the essence of the stipulations - they go and write and sign according to what is good in their eyes about them, until they [strip] them clean of their possessions. And the Lord, our God, did not give us, the holy people, this [way] to do anything that is not the way of truth. And therefore the prohibition against deceptions is repeated in the Torah three times, as it is written in three places (Leviticus 19:33, 25:14, 17), \"a man shall not wrong his people.\"", 
                "And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, also informed us in several places in the gemara to establish every thing according to the truth of the matter, and according to the thought of the sellers and the buyers; and that we not fashion the judgement entirely according to their words, but rather according to the intention of the people, when their intention is clear to us. And [it is] like the matter that they, may their memory be blessed, said in Ketuvot 97a in the chapter [entitled] Almanah Nizunet, [that] if one sold and [subsequently] did not need the [liquid cash], the sale goes back; and that is [in the case] when he revealed his thought, that it was because he needed the money to do such and such with it that he made the sale. And we also say in Kiddushin 50a in the chapter [entitled] Haeesh HaMekadesh Bo UbeShlucho, \"A certain man sold his possessions with the intention of going up to the Land of Israel; he went up but he did not settle [there]. Rava said [about this], 'Anyone who goes up has the intention of settling, and he did not settle'\" - which is to say [that] the sale goes back. Behold, their opinion was to say that all actions should be concluded according to the truth and the intentions of the doers. And this is a straight path that a person should choose for himself and [so] be successful in all of his deeds.", 
                "The customary text among us for contracts of sales, of gifts, of behests and of giving over rights is this: We, the undersigned witnesses, know clear testimony that x the son of y told us, \"Be witnesses for me and acquire [this testimony] from me and give it to Rabbi b the son of c, that it be a proof and a benefit for him, because I have taken and received from his hand such and such money and sold him for it, x vineyard (or field or house), as is indicated and marked off by its indications and its borders, and these are the borders of that place: on side x, such, and on side y, etc.\" - until he marks it off from its four sides. \"Everything that is within these borders have I, x, sold with a complete sale and acquisition, from now, for the money mentioned, etc.\" And afterwards, he specifically mentions [the various] aspects of that place - for example, trees, stones, beams, walls, roofs. And all of this is for the embellishment of the contract. And he needs to mention its height and depth (Bava Batra 63a). And so [too] have they become accustomed now to write on loan contracts, \"On condition that the seventh year not remove it.\" As, if not, the seventh year would remove it; since we hold that the removal of money [debts on the seventh year] is practiced outside the land  rabbinically, as I have written above (Sefer HaChinukh 477).", 
                "And they, may their memory be blessed, also said (Bava Batra 167a) about this matter of contracts that a person should not write the sum of three to ten at the end of a line, lest [the one holding it] forge it and write thirty instead of three or forty instead of four or fifty instead of five (which in Hebrew only requires the addition of more letters at the end of the word), etc. And if it came out at the end of a line, we go back [and write it again] two or three times, and [then] it is possible that it will come out in the middle of the line. And they likewise said (Bava Batra 165b) that if 'one hundred' is written  at the top, and 'two hundred' at the bottom - or the opposite - that it always goes according to [what is written at] the bottom. And they likewise said (Bava Batra 167b) that we write a contract for the seller or the borrower, even if the purchaser or the creditor is not with him. But we only write contracts for sharecropping or contractual work or arbitration - or any act of court - with the knowledge of them, both. And Rabbi Yitschak bar Yosef said in the chapter [entitled] Get Pashut (Bava Batra 161b) that a person must write down the existence of all erasures, entirely. And he also needs to review the subject of the contract on the last line, since we do not learn form the last line (and the review is not essential). And because of that, if the witnesses spaced their signatures one [extra blank] line below the writing, [the contract is still] fit. And that which they have become accustomed to writing 'everything is firm and valid' (Tosafot on Bava Batra 162a:1, s.v. lefi), is because the expression does not invalidate a contract and - even if we did learn from it - there  is nothing [harmful] in this. And Rava said there (Bava Batra 163a) that a contract wherein he and his witnesses [write] on top of the erasure is fit. And Rav Shisha, the son pf Rav Eedee said in the chapter [entitled] Hazahav (Bava Metzia 47a) that we write in the contracts, \"And I acquired from him, with a vessel with which it is fitting to acquire.\" \"With a vessel\" is to exclude that of Rav Sheshet, who said that we can acquire with cows; \"which it is fitting\" is to exclude that of Shumuel, who said that we can acquire with a dung vessel (<i>maroka</i>); \"to acquire\" is to exclude that of Levi, who said with the vessels of the one who is making the acquisition - and Rav, and [perhaps] Rav Ashi said that that \"which it is fitting\" is to exclude that from which it is forbidden to derive benefit.

And if the contract is not in their hands, he gives over his possession of it, by way of its attachment to four ells of land. And [about] any oral contract, they, may their memory be blessed, said (Kiddushin 48a and see Tosafot on Bava Batra 77b:1, s.v. Rav Pappa) that it can only be acquired in the presence of the three of them (the creditor, the borrower and the purchaser of the obligation).

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 24:10), \"you must not enter his house to seize his pledge\" - and it is not specifically the house [that was intended], but the same is true of one who grabs it from his hand in the marketplace.

[If so,] what is the difference between an agent of the court and the [creditor] himself? That the agent of the court is permitted to strip the surety from the hand of the creditor by force when he finds him outside; whereas the creditor is not permitted to strip it from him, until the debtor hands it over with his consent.

And, so too, it helps with the matter that this surety does not become [classified as] movable goods with regards to the son of the borrower - as we hold that the [inherited] movable goods of orphans are not liened to the creditor, unless the borrower acquired it for the creditor explicitly - as is the way that we do it today in our contracts. And since this surety is in the possession of the creditor - even if the borrower dies when it is in his home - it does not become movable goods with regards to his sons. Rather, the creditor extracts it and he is paid [for the debt] from it. It also helps him that if he wants to be paid for his debt, he sells it and is paid from it - if the borrower does not want to redeem it. As they only said that he has to return it forever, if the creditor does not want to be paid from it for his debt.

And the same is true of financial cases - that we do not believe some relatives about some relatives. However it is mentioned regarding laws [involving] death sentences by way of hyperbole - that we should not say, since this is [causing] the loss of life, we should not suspect the relative about him, but rather do like his testimony; since his testimony is to lose the life of his relative. And even though the verse only mentioned the fathers and the sons, the same is true of several of the other relatives.

And if we would believe their testimony, one against the other; perhaps in their constant anger, one against the other, their anger would momentarily rise and they would come in front of the court and condemn their heads to the king.

And it is established for us that a third with a first is [a] proper [witness], and, all the more so, a third with a second - and it is not necessary to say that a third with a third is proper. But a second with a second is disqualified - and it is not necessary to say that a second with a first is disqualified. And according to this, the father is disqualified with his son and with his son's son; but he is proper with the son of his son's son - as he is a third with a first. But there are a few commentators (Rashbam on Bava Batra 128a:18), the opinion of which is to say that that all those that come from the 'thigh' of  a person are disqualified for him. And the brother with his sister are likewise called a first with a first, like with brothers.

And we say 'a husband is like his wife' once, but we do not say 'a husband is like his wife' twice [over]. For example (as a result), the son-in-law of his brother-in-law (the brother of his wife's sister) is proper to testify for him, as it is his brother-in-law who is disqualified to him because of his wife's sister - who is a sexual prohibition for him. But the son-in-law of his brother-in-law is not disqualified to him, because he is married to the daughter of the sister of his wife, who is disqualified to him - since 'a husband is like his wife' about this matter is not said twice [over].

And regarding this matter, when he is engaged to his wife, she herself is disqualified, but her relatives are not, until he marries her. And, as a general rule, our teachers, may God protect them, taught us concerning the matter of testimony that anyone who knows testimony for his fellow and was originally proper - meaning to say he was not disqualified to him - and became disqualified to him in between, and then returned to being proper - for example, that he became distant - is proper to testify for him. [This is the case] even though he became disqualified in between. But if he was disqualified originally - even though he became proper in the end - he is disqualified.

But if he does not perform the positive commandment and it is also impossible to perform it any longer - and for example, [if] the thing were lost or burnt - he is lashed. And the example of this is with the corner of the field, the reaping of which is a negative commandment (Sefer HaChinukh 217): And if he reaps it, he is not obligated in [getting] lashes for the reaping; as behold, he is able to fix what he distorted [by] giving it to the poor in its sheaves. And even if he threshed the wheat and ground and baked it, he can give the required amount of 'the corner' to the poor from the bread; and behold, it is still in his hand to fix [the sin] and [so,] he is not lashed. But if an accident happens that all of that wheat gets lost or it gets burnt, he is lashed; as behold, it is impossible for him to still perform the positive commandment in it. And [so,] he has already  transgressed the negative commandment and he can not fix [it]. And this is called in the gemara, 'he did not fulfill it.' And if he lost the wheat in his [own] hands or ate all of it, all the more so is he obligated in [getting] lashes for it. And this is called, 'he negated it,' in the Talmud, as he was the cause for the negating of the negative commandment in his hands - a negation that no can longer be fixed. And [about] that which they said in Makkot 16a at the end of the chapter [entitled] Elu Hen HaLokin concerning the commandment of sending away the nest regarding 'he fulfilled it and he did not fulfill it,' \"We only have this and one other [case]\" - and it is known that the other is 'the corner' - as it is concluded there, \"But rather 'this and one other' is about that,\" meaning to say, [about] 'the corner,' and the matter stays like that - their intention is not that it wants to say that only sending away the nest and 'the corner' have this law of 'he fulfilled it and he did not fulfill it.' But rather their intention was to say 'the corner' and all that have a similar law - such as fallen grapes, that which is forgotten, the fallen sheaves, and the bunchless grapes - as each one of these is a negative commandment that [involves] an act, and it is [just] as likely with them to have all that is likely with 'the corner,' regarding 'he fulfilled it and he did not fulfill it' or 'he negated it and he did not negate it.' As the verse from which we learned that in 'the corner' there is a positive commandment, is that which is written about it (Leviticus 19:10),  \"you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger.\" And with the sheaf of what is forgotten and the others mentioned, there is likewise about them, \"you shall leave them for the stranger and the orphan and the widow,\" or \"it shall go to the stranger, the orphan, and the widow.\" And take this matter and understand it, as it is a little hidden, in that the language in the gemara is somewhat unclear - in that which they said, \"We only have this and one other [case].\"",

And they would lash him according to that which they appraised him that he can withstand from the flogging and not die. And even after they estimated him and started flogging him - if they saw they he is not able to withstand the estimate that they estimated about him, they leave him; as we say in the chapter [entitled] Elu Hen HaLokin in Tractate Makkot 22b, \"[If]  he is partially flogged and they saw that he is not fit to take that which they estimated about him, he is exempt.\"",

If they are torn, they are torn (so be it), and if they become unstitched, they become unstitched, until his heart (chest) is uncovered.

And it is not necessary for the matter of lashes to have a court of twenty-three. And a court that transgresses this, and does not give lashes to one obligated in [getting] lashes, negates this positive commandment.

And the elucidation of this matter is like this: That the limit of lashes for anyone who is obligated in [getting] lashes is forty strikes minus one, as has come through the tradition (see Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Lo Taase 300). And he should not flog anyone until he has appraised the flogging, that it should be according to the ability of the one struck, and his years and his constitution and the form of his body. And if he can withstand the flogging of the complete maximum punishment, he flogs [him accordingly]. And if cannot withstand it, [the judge] flogs [him] according to his ability [to withstand it]. And there is never less than three strikes, and the fullness of the count of the number of strikes is always forty minus one, as we have said. And this prevention comes [that he not] increase striking him even one strike upon this number or upon that which the judge appraised that he can withstand. And about all of this is it stated (Deuteronomy 25:3), \"you shall not increase.\" And so did they say in Sifrei, \"If he increases, he transgresses a negative commandment.

And this prohibition is a warning to hit anyone of Israel. And if we are warned about not striking the sinner, is it not all the more so with all other people?

If they estimated about him that he could take twenty, we do not say to lash him twenty-one - since they are divisible by three - but rather we lash him eighteen. And [regarding] one who was estimated for lashes, and when they began to lash him, he broke down and defecated or urinated, we do not lash him any more, as it states (Deuteronomy 25:3), \"and your brother be degraded before your eyes\" - from when he is degraded, he is exempted. If the strap split before they finished lashing him - even after the first strike - he is exempted. [If] they tied him to the column and he took off the strings with his strength and ran away, he is exempt. Anyone who has sinned and is lashed goes back to being [considered] proper, as it states, \"and your brother be degraded\" - once he is degraded, he is your brother.

And also there is no memory of him in the physical world besides this woman, who is the bone of his bones and the flesh of his flesh; and [so] it was from the kindnesses of God to him to establish seed from her for him, through his brother - who is also like half of his flesh - in order that this seed take his place and serve his Creator in his stead; and he merit through him in the world of souls, where he is. As it is known that a son gives merit to the father, as so did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Sanhedrin 104a), \"A child gives merit to a father, a father does not give merit to a child.\" And truthfully likewise, does the living brother that fathered the children from the levirate wife also get a share in them for himself, and he also gets merit in their merit. Nonetheless, not all of the merit will go to him; but rather his brother will take his portion because of the big portion that he has in them - and that is the wife that fell to his portion first, as we have said.", 
                "And according to that which we mentioned, when the verse states (Genesis 38:9), \"But Onan, knowing that the seed would not be his,\" its sense [in terms] of the simple meaning is to say that not all of the merit of the seed would be his, as his brother would take a part in it; and he was not [interested] in partial merit. And also because maybe the main merit is to the dead brother, since he is like the owner of the field and the living brother is like a sharecropper - and like the well-known matter about sharecroppers, that there are some that provide their own seed.

And the five judges are careful (Yevamot 104a) that they not be related to each other or to the levirate husband or the levirate wife. And [then] they say to each other, \"Let us go to place x, and set a place for the release of y\" - since so did Rava say (Yevamot 101b), \"The judges have to set a place.\" And they [all] go there and the judges sit and the levirate husband and the levirate wife stand - as if in judgement, wherein the judges are sitting and the litigants are standing. And there is no impediment in this - such that if they did it [with the levirate husband and the levirate wife] sitting, the release is not disqualified by this. And afterwards, the judges ask the levirate husband if he is thirteen years and a day old and has produced two [pubic] hairs, and they also find out clearly that the woman being released is the wife of the dead brother of this releaser - as Rava said (Yevamot 106a), \"We do not release if we do not recognize.\" And when they know all of this with certainty and the matter is clear to them, they also ask the woman if she ate that day. And if she ate, we do not release on that day, [as] we are concerned lest she ate things that bring her to spitting; and we need the spitting to be from her - as Rava said (Yevamot 106b), \"[If] she ate garlic and spit, [or] if she ate a clod of dirt and spit, it is nothing; 'and she spits' - we need it to be from her and [this] is not.\" Nonetheless, this thing does not impede [it], and if they released her in this way, their release is fit, ex post facto; as behold, the spitting being from her does not impede [it].", 
                "And afterwards, if the court sees that the levirate husband and the levirate wife are [legally] fit for one another, they start with the levirate husband (Yevamot  106b) and say to him, \"If it is pleasing to you to perform levirate marriage, perform [it] - and, if not, release [her].\" And if he wants to release her, he takes a hard sandal that is all leather, or a soft sandal, since all of the people have already become accustomed to it (Yevamot 102a). And he should be careful that it all be stitched with leather (Yevamot 102b), and that it not be exceedingly large, but rather medium - so that he can walk with it - and also not too small, but rather it should at least cover the majority of his foot. And, a priori, he should release [her] with his shoe and it [should be] the right shoe; however, ex post facto, this does not impede [it]. And there should be two straps of leather or of hair sewn into the shoe (Yevamot 107b), and they should be big enough to wrap it around his foot. And he should put the shoe on his right foot; and he [should be otherwise] barefoot and not with stockings, so that it not 'upon that which is \"upon.\"' And if he released [her] with the left foot, his release is disqualified (Yevamot 104a). And he should be careful that the shoe not be so tall that it goes over his knee - as this is also 'upon that which is \"upon.\"' But [if it is] below the knee, it is certainly not 'upon that which is \"upon.\"' And afterwards, he ties the straps around his foot, and he ties two knots. And the levirate husband stands next to the wall or next to a post and presses his foot onto the ground - as Amimar says, \"That one that releases needs to press his foot\" (Yevamot 103a). ", 
                "And afterwards (Yevamot 106b), the court has the levirate wife recite in the holy tongue [the relevant passage] from, \"My levirate husband refuses\" until \"he does not want to perform levirate marriage with me.\" And she should be careful not to pause between \"does not\" [and] \"want,\" but rather read these two words at one time without a pause, so that it does not sound like \"want[s] to perform levirate marriage with me.\" And they have the levirate husband recite, \"I do not want to marry her.”", 
                "And afterwards, the levirate wife comes next to the levirate husband and she approaches him and unties the straps without any assistance from the levirate husband at all. And [then] she removes the shoe from his foot - and also in this, the levirate husband does not assist at all. Rather, he stands next to the wall and presses his foot properly onto the ground. And it is all [done] standing, as we have said. And according to our gemara (Bavli Yevamot 102a), she removes [the shoe] with either her left hand or her right hand - as we do not find an exactitude about this in the gemara. But in Yerushalmi, Yevamot 12:1, they said that she needs to remove [it] with the right hand. Hence, the [woman] should concern herself [about this] and, a priori, remove [it] with the right. And if she has no hands, she should remove it with her teeth, [even] a priori, and as it is explained in the gemara (Yevamot 105a).", 
                "And afterwards \"and she spits in his face\" - spit that the judges can see - as Rava says (Yevamot 106b), \"The judges need to see the spit that came out of the mouth of the levirate wife.\" And \"we need [...] that the spit reaches in front of the face of the levirate husband,\" as we say in the gemara. [It is] such that if he is tall and she is a midget and the wind caught it [upwards], we call this \"in his face\"; but if she is tall and he is a midget and the wind caught it [upwards], it does not help at all - as we need that it 'reaches in front of the face.' However, after it 'reaches in front of his face,' if the wind caught it, we have no [concern about] it. ", 
                "And afterwards, the court has her recite in the holy tongue from, \"Thus shall be done to the man\" until  \"the unshoed one.” And afterwards, all who are standing there answer, \"The unshoed one, the unshoed one,\" three times. As it is taught (Yevamot 106b), \"Rabbi Yehudah said, 'One time we were sitting in front of Rabbi Tarfon, and a levirate wife came to remove [the shoe]. He said to us, \"All of you answer, 'The unshoed one,' three times in the holy tongue.\"'\" And they said in the gemara (Yevamot 106b), \"Rav Yehudah said that Rav said, 'The mitzvah of removal is [that] she reads and he reads, she removes and spits and reads.' What [novelty] do we infer - it is [already in] our mishnah? We infer that [this is only] a mitzvah (an ideal fulfillment of the commandment), and if [the order] is reversed, we have no [concern about] it.\" And so is the law.", 
                "And after she removes [the shoe] in court as is fitting, the court writes her a contract of release, so that she can get married to [anyone in] the marketplace with it. And Rabbi Alfasi, may his memory be blessed, wrote in his Laws (Rif Yevamot 35b in his pagination) and this is his language: \"And so the writing of the release contract has to be lined with lines and not [written] with [inferior] ink, and he needs to write, 'In the place of the sitting of three as one,' and the three sign it, and [that is] only if they know how to read it to others.", 
                "And this is the contract of release: On x day that is this number in the month x, which is this number [year] from the creation of the world, according to the number that is accustomed in the place x, we the judges, some of which are signed below, are in the sitting of three as one in the court. And x the daughter of y came down in front of us, the widow of z, and she brought close in front of us a man, whose name was b the son of c. And so did she say to us, 'This b, the son of c, the brother - [born] from the father - of z the son of c, who married me and died and left our rabbis and all of Israel alive, but he did not leave a son or daughter that would inherit and would be related and bring out his name in Israel. And this b, his brother, is fitting to perform levirate marriage with me. And now, our rabbis, my judges, say to him, \"If you want to perform levirate marriage with me, perform [it].\" And, if not, let him extend his right foot in front of you, and I will untie the shoe from upon his foot and spit in his face.' And we have ascertained it, that this b is the brother of z, [born] from the father, and we said to him, 'If you want to perform levirate marriage with her, perform [it] - and, if not, extend your right foot to her in front of me, and she will untie your shoe from upon your foot and spit in your face.' And he answered and said, 'I do not want to perform levirate marriage with her.' Immediately, I had this x recite, 'My levirate husband refuses to establish a name in Israel for his brother; he does not want to perform levirate marriage with me.' And also [with] this b, I had him recite, 'I do not want to marry her.' And he extended his right foot and she untied his shoe from upon his foot and spat in his face - spit that was visible to us from her mouth to the ground. And again, I made this x recite, 'Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother’s house!' And again I had her recite, 'And he shall go in Israel by the name of the family of the unshoed one.' And we, the judges, and all who were sitting there, answered after her, 'the unshoed one,' three times. And once this event happened in front of us, we have permitted this x to go and marry any man she wants, and no one should protest against her [for that], from this day and forever. And this x requested this contract of release, and I have written it and signed it and given it to her to own, like the law of  Moshe and Israel. And three [judges] sign on it.\"", 
                "And the rest of the details of this commandment are elucidated in the tractate connected to the laws of levirate marriage and release, and that is Tractate Yevamot. And for this, is it called Yevamot (levirate marriages) and not Chalitsot (releases) - because they, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 39b), \"The commandment of levirate marriage precedes the commandment of release.\"",

And about this is it stated (Deuteronomy 25:12), \"You shall cut off her hand; show no pity.\" And they said in Sifrei (see Sefer HaMitzvot LaRambam, Mitzvot Ase 247), \"'And she seizes him by his genitals' - and just like that place is distinguished by a danger to life (<i>sakanat nefashot</i>) and it says about it, 'You shall cut off her hand'; so too anything that has a danger to life, behold it is [included] in 'You shall cut off her hand.' And from where [do I know] that if he cannot save him with only her hand, that he is obligated to save him with her life? [Hence,] it teaches us to say, 'show no pity.'\" And that which the verse stated \"the wife of one,\" [is because] the verse was speaking according to what is common; as the wife of a person is always with him and tries to save him from his attacker with all of our strength; but it is the same with any person.",

And also because the eyes and heart of the pursued are always to God to deliver him from the hand of his pursuer. And [it is] like the matter that is written (Ecclesiastes 3:15), \"and God seeks the pursued\" - meaning to say that the pursued seeks God and pleads with Him. Therefore, Blessed be He, commanded us to help him.",

And to what do these words apply - that we save with the life of the pursuer? When it is impossible for us to save [the pursued] with one of the limbs of [the pursuer]; but if it is possible to save him with one of the limbs and he saved him with his life - this is spilling of blood (murder). And so did our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, say (Sanhedrin 49a) about the death of Avner when Yoav killed him: As it is written there (II Samuel 3:27), \"and he died for shedding the blood of Asahel, his brother.\" And the tradition came about this that Yoav had a claim against Avner for the blood of Asahel, and judged him in a case of the Sanhedrin (High Court) - which means to say that he killed him for a claim for which it would have been fitting to [receive] death according to the Sanhedrin: He said to him, \"Why did you kill Asahel?\" Avner said [back] to him, \"He was a pursuer.\" Yoav said to him, \"You should have saved yourself with one of his limbs.\" Avner said to him, \"I did not know how to aim at him [in that way].\" Yoav said to him, \"You aimed onto his fifth rib! And you did not know how to aim at him?\" And about this is it stated, \"he died for shedding the blood of Asahel, his brother.\"",

And the same is true of one pursuing behind [another] male to have sexual relations with him. But [in the case of] one pursuing behind an animal - and so [too, with] one running to do one of all of the other sins in the Torah, even to worship idolatry, we do not kill him until he does the sin, as we judge him in a court.

To turn aside all our words that are between us and beside us, it is a way of kindness and compassion, when we found out from our Torah that this is the way of God, and this is God’s desire for God’s creations, so that you merit God’s goodness, because his desire is kindness as it is written (Deuteronomy 28:9): walk in God’s ways, and God added to this in another place, as it is written (Deuteronomy 10:12, 11:22): walk in all God’s ways."

                "To gather all of Yisrael on the Sukkos Festival--that we were commanded that the nation of Yisrael should gather in its entirety, men, women, and children, at the closing of the shemittah year on the Festival of Sukkos on the second day of the Festival, and to read a small amount from the Book of Mishneh Torah for them to hear, which is the Book of Devarim. And on this it says--\"Gather all the nation, men, women, and children, etc.\" And this is the mitzvah of Hakhel that is mentioned in the Gemara, as they said in the first of Kiddushin, \"and Hakhel is a positive mitzvah that is time-bound--how are women obligated in it? And they explained at the end of the topic: we do not learn from the general rules, which means to say that the women are obligated in this mitzvah. ", 
                "From the roots (reasons) of the mitzvah: since the entire point of the nation of Yisrael is the Torah, and through it they are separated from every nation and language to be meritorious to eternal life, eternal pleasure that is not surpassed by anything in Creation, therefore since the entire point is in it, it is fitting that everyone should gather together at one point in time to hear its words, and for the voice to go out amongst the whole nation, men, women, and children--to say, what is the thing that we are all gathering for into this tremendous gathering all together?-- And the answer would be, to hear the words of the Torah, which is our entire purpose and our glory and splendor; and they will come from this to tell of the great praise and the splendor of its value, and a yearning will enter all of their hearts, and with this yearning in it, they will learn to know Hashem and merit goodness, and Hashem will be happy with His creations, like it says explicitly about this mitzvah--\"and in order that they will learn and fear Hashem.\"", 
                "From the rules of the mitzvah: what they said, may their memories be blessed--that the king is obligated to read it for them to hear. And he reads it in the Ezras Nashim. And he reads while sitting, but if he reads while standing--that's even better. And from where does he read? From the beginning of the Book of Devarim until the end of the topic of Shema Yisrael, and he skips to \"V'haya im shamo'ah\" and finishes that topic, and skips to \"aser t'aser\" and reads that according to the proper order until the end of the blessings and curses, up until \"besides for the covenant which He made with them in Choreiv (sinai)\"--and stops.", 
                "And how does he read? They blow trumpets throughout Yerushalayim, and bring a big stage, which was made of wood, and stand it up in the middle of the Ezras Nashim, and the king walks over and sits on it, so that they will hear his reading, and all of Yisrael that came for the Festival surround him. And the Chazan of the gathering takes a Torah Scroll and gives it to the head of the gathering, who gives it to the s'gan (assistant), who gives it to the Kohein Gadol, who gives it to the king, to glorify him through the many people. And the king accepts it while he is standing and if he wants, he sits, and he opens it and makes a b'racha like the manner that everyone who reads from the Torah in the shul does; and he reads the topics which we said, and makes a b'racha after it as they do in shuls, and he adds seven, and these are they: R'tzei, Modim, Ata B'chartanu (until m'kadeish Yisrael)--these are three b'rachos like their nature. the fourth he davens for the Mikdash, and finishes \"Shochein b'tziyon.\" the fifth he davens for Yisrael, that their kingdom should stand, and finishes \"haBocheir b'Yisrael.\" The sixth he davens for the kohanim. The seventh he begs and davens through it according to what he is able, and finishes it \"save Your nation Yisrael, for Your nation Yisrael must be saved....shomei'a tefilah\"", 
                "This mitzvah applies at the time when Yisrael is on their land. And one who transgresses this, whether man or woman, and did not come on this appointed time to hear the words of the Torah, and also the king--if he does not want to read, he forfeits this positive mitzvah; and their punishment is very great, because this mitzvah is a strong pillar and great honor in the religion.

                "For everyone to write a torah scroll for himself:  For we were commanded that each man in Israel must have his own torah scroll (see Rambam's Sefer HaMitzvot, positive commandment #18).  If he wrote it with his own hand, this is praiseworthy and very dear, as the sages of blessed memory said (Menahot 30a): \"\"Write\" means by hand-- the text attributes to him as if he received it from Mount Sinai.\"  One who is unable to write with his own hand must pay someone to write it for him.  About this it is said (Deut. 31:19) \"Now, write for yourselves this poem and teach it to the Children of Israel\".  This is to say, write for yourselves a Torah, which contains this poem."
