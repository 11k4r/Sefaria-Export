            "There is a night when the souls come out of their graves, like on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, when they come out and pray. And two people already went and hid themselves in the graveyard and heard that one was calling to her friend: Let us go and pray together! All of the souls came out and prayed and asked for mercy so that death would not be decreed upon the living, and those who will die that they return from their evil ways, and that they die through minor illness, and about every matter of the living and the dead; and about themselves, to quickly remove judgement from upon them and from upon others - and they told their congregation. The next year on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, two others went and only one virgin came out of the grave, who had died last week. They said: Come out! She said: I cannot, because my father was rich and lost his possessions and buried me without clothing. And they heard that some of the souls said we will not gather together because two have already revealed us to many. Rather, each one of us will pray in the grave, so that the living will not hear and tell the nation. And they became angry at the father and took clothing and clothed that virgin..."
