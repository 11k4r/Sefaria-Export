This rebellion against the sovereignty of silence destroys all its buildings, all the storehouse of simplicity and rectitude, of depth and transcendent communication - everything shatters in fragments. Afterwards, if one wants to rebuild that which was destroyed, they must establish everything anew, and in that moment a discerning person is silent. In truth when silence is honored in the moment of its appearance, then it asserts its rule, establishes its hall, penetrating to the deepest depths of its abyss and bringing out glorious ramifications and mighty branchings with a powerful and refreshing vital force - the shrubs (sichim) are filled with strength and new expressions of the lips (Is. 57:19) come. Then the time for speech begins, in its beautiful glory, and the spirit of silence serves as the mediating angel that works upon the flood of speech, flowing like a river in all its preciousness and abundant wealth. \"I will create new expressions of the lips: Peace, peace, both far and near, says the Lord. And I will heal him. (Is. 57:19) \"...Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.\" (Ezekiel 47:12) "

How does one latch onto the joy of the Land of Israel, the inner peace of the Land of Israel, the devotion of the Land of Israel, the truth of the Land of Israel, the strength and courage of the Land of Israel, the certainty of the Land of Israel? Pity, O God,  have mercy, O compassionate and gracious God, have compassion, grant me the ability to return to You in complete repentance, and bring me back to the Land of  your delight.

In times of hiding and concealment - what pain I feel, what bitterness I feel. From the depths I call out to you, O God, \"I called aloud to Him, He is exalted on my tongue,\" (Psalms, 66:17) \"In distress, you called out and I rescued you, I shall answer you from the secret place of thunder.\" (Psalms, 81:8)"

The more that their soul's light lives within them, to the extent that they feel each word they speak forth shooting out like an arrow, like a flood of living waters, and how it is drawn from the source of life, making its impact in the world. The particular quality of speech's affect is measured according to the extent of the soul's elevation, each according to their level. "

It is this soul which is pained by its reduction, and of its own accord goodness progressively overcomes. Through this very knowledge, through faithfulness to it and delving deeply in it, the pure soul awakens in joy and knows that it she becoming holy, rising up, spreading out more and more. “The LORD is their strength; He is a stronghold for the deliverance of His anointed,” (Psalms 28:8) “…and my heart exulted, so I will glorify Him with my song.” (Ps. 28:7)"

                "When we forget our own subjective soul, when we distract ourselves from looking at our inner life, everything becomes confused and uncertain. And the main teshuvah, that lights up the darkness in an instant, is that one returns to oneself, to the roots of one’s soul, and immediately returns to God, to the soul of all souls, and stride forward up and up in holiness and purity. And this is the case with a lone individual, a whole people, all of humanity, with the restoration of all being, whose ruin always proceeds from forgetting itself. And if it desires to return to God, but isn’t prepared to gather its scattered ones, this is a deceptive teshuvah, taking God’s name in vain. And so only by the great truth of teshuvah to oneself, will a person and the nation, the world and all the worlds, all of being, return to its maker, to light in the light of life. And that is the secret of the light of the Messiah, the coming into view of the soul of the world, with whose illumination the world will return to the root of being, and God’s light will reveal itself upon him. And from the source of this great teshuvah, man will draw the sacred life-force of true teshuvah."

                "The hatred of wickedness, when it is great and deep, must at firstcome together with hatred of the wicked. Only afterwards can it be sweetened through the power of consciousness and clarified until it takes its clean, ennobled form which is solely the hatred of wickedness, while toward those who carry it, who are the wicked themselves, we are filled with compassion. ‘Let the sins cease and not the sinners.’ (Berachot 10a) If at its inception hatred comes in its ideal form, focusing its essence only on the hatred of abstract wickedness, it will never be actualized in its full strength even as that hatred of wickedness. This is because the lack of hatred for the wicked will blur the hatred of wickedness itself, and then all the storehouse of good will be placed in great danger. This was the stumbling block for many fallen, who fell because from the beginning they employed the hatred of wickedness in its ennobled form, and the absence of hatred for the wicked afterwards was transformed into love for them. And through the love of the wicked they fell into the love of wickedness itself. Therefore, the first thought must be in the quality of the aspect of judgment, and afterwards mercy will come and sweeten it through their union. "
