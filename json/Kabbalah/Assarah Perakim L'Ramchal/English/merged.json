            "Souls - The work of the Place to the souls: there are five names. N[efesh]. R[uach]. N[eshamah]. Ch[ayah]. Y[echidah]. [They come] from 5 faces. Ch\"y [chayah and yechidah] from Atzilut. Neshamah from Briah. Ruach from Yetzirah. Nefesh from Asyah. The force of a human being is found from malchut of asyah until the keter of atzilut. This is why it is written: \"Let us make the Human in Our image as Our Character and they shall rule over the fish-creatures of the sea\" (Genesis 1:26).", 
            "The fixing of Neshama are reincarnation (gilgul) and intercalation (yibur). How so? the work of the Neshamah is 613 mitzvot, their completion leads to the resting of the soul, and if not, she comes back and is reincarnated, and she does not reincarnate whole, just the parts that need fixing.", 
            "What is reincarnation and what is intercalation? Reincarnation is from the moment of birth to the moment of death; intercalation can come every \"hour\", and can leave every \"hour\". A mitzvah in which the soul is obligated to fulfill happens in a reincarnation, and one that the soul is not obligated to fulfill happens in an intercalation, from the moment is is fulfilled it [the intercalation] is gone. Righteous [people/souls] can reincarnate a thousand [times], evil [people/souls] up to four, as it is written \"and to the fourth I will not make her return\"(Amos 1:3).", 
            "The nefesh comes at the beginning, and after it the ruach, and after it the neshamah, and chayah and yechidah after them. All souls [neshamah] have a cloak. The nefesh reincarnates by herself, and the ruach by herself, and the neshamah by herself. And souls [neshamot] ride the cloaks of others. The souls are not all equal, since the new ones are not like the old ones, and the ones that reincarnate for the first time and not like the ones which experienced reincarnation twice, and on all He says: \"And they are turned round about by His guidance, that they may do\" (Job 37:12). And He says: \"and let Him devise means, that he that is banished be not an outcast from Him\" (II Samuel 14:14). And He says: \"Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him.\" (Isaiah 43:7). And He says: \"Hashem will reign forever\" (Exodus 15:18). And He says: \"And all your people are righteous, they shall inherit the land for ever; the branch of My planting, the work(s) of My hands, wherein I glory\" (Isaiah 60:21)."
