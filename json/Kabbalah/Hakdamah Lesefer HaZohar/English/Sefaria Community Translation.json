        " In this introduction to the Zohar I would like to explain certain ideas that many have touched upon, a lot has been written on, but still its depths has not been perceived. My first question: a) what is our essence? b) what is our role in this reality, that each of us is a small link? c) when we look around us, we see that humanity has many faults, but when we think about the creator we must assume that he is the most complete; then why would a complete manufacturer (creator), create a faulty product? d) why would a loving creator, create people, many of whom suffer throughout their lives, shouldn't a complete creator create goodness, and especially not create pain? e) how is it possible that from an eternal creator, people are created, that end and are gone.   ", 
        "And in order to completely clarify all this, we must initially make some inquires (about the creator) not in areas that we are forbidden to discuss, in other words about the Creator's essence, which we have no knowledge whatsoever, but in an area where we do have some knowledge of God, that is in His actions. As it says: \"Know the God of your forefathers, and worship Him\". And it is also written, in the \"Shir HaYichud\": \"You (God) are known through your actions\". The first inquiry is: How is it possible for God to create something from nothing, \"ex nihilo\" for everyone knows that raw materials are needed to create any product. And also, since God is the creator, creation did not come from \"nothing\", it came from God. Second inquiry: Even if we acknowledge, that it is in God's power to even create \"something from nothing\", in other words, something completely new, not found in God Himself; what exactly is that \"something\" that God created from \"nothing\". Third inquiry: What the Kabbalists say that the soul of man, is a \"part of God Himself\" in that there is no difference between the soul  and God, just that God is the \"whole\" and the soul is a \"part\" (of God). And they compared this to a stone separated from a mountain. However, the stone is separated from the mountain by a tool used for that purpose. But what is the \"tool\" that separates the soul from God Himself. In other words, at what point is it called \"soul\" and not God Himself.", 
        "Fourth Inquiry: Since evil (the \"other side\", and the \"shells\") are distanced from God's holiness an infinite distance, how is it possible that evil emanates from God Himself, and not only that, but also that God sustains evil. Fifth Inquiry: The matter of resurrection of the dead. Since the body is finite and from the moment of birth, the end result will be death and burial; and not only that, but the Zohar says, that the body has to completely rot before the soul can enter Eden, why the need for the resurrection of the dead. Couldn't God just delight the soul, without the body? And more perplexing, is that which is written, that at the resurrection of the dead, God will resurrect each body with the defect that it had before death, so that no one should say, \"this is not the same person that died\", and only later will God heal that person from their prior defect. Why should God care so much what other people say, to the point that He has to resurrect the dead with all their defects, and only later heal them. Sixth Inquiry: That which is stated in the Zohar (Tazriah 40), and also in Tractate Sanhedrin (37a) that all of reality, our solar system, all the billions of galaxies, all the spiritual worlds, were made for even just one person, since each person is the center of the universe. It is difficult to understand, how a person whose worth appears to be so small as compared to all of reality, how can he be the center of the universe? And especially when we compare man to the spiritual worlds, that have no boundaries. Why would God create all these worlds, the physical and the spiritual, just for man? What benefit is there to man, from all this?", 
        "In order to try to find answers to these questions and inquiries, our strategy must be to look at the end result! In other words, to the goal of creation. For it is not possible to understand anything, if we only observe the manufacturing process without seeing the final product. And it is obvious that there is no worker that doesn't work towards a goal. For only a deranged person works with no goal in mind. I know, however, that there are philosophers, those who do not follow the torah and mitzvoth, who say that it is true that God created the world, but he has removed Himself from it, due to the lowly nature of people, since it is not befitting God to associate Himself with such lowly creatures. However, they have not thought this through. Because had we created ourselves, then we can say that we have all these bad traits. But once we decide that the Creator who is complete, He created us, with all that is good about us, and all of our faults, we must realize that a high level manufacturer (God) only produces high level products (people), and every product reflects the quality of the producer. It is not the fault of an inferior suit, if it was produced by a lousy tailor, why should the suit be blamed. This is similar to the story (Tractate Taanit 20b) about Rabbi Elazar who happened to come across an exceedingly ugly person, when told by Rabbi Elazar that he is very ugly, answered back: \"go and tell the craftsman that made me, how ugly is the vessel that you made\". Imagine if you came across a person, who would create people who suffer all their lives, and not only that, but would forsake them, and not try to help them even a tiny amount, how much scorn would you pour on such a person! Is it possible to even imagine this about God, who is the positive force of the universe!  ", 
        "Therefore, a clear thinking individual must come to the realization, opposite to what appears on the surface, and conclude, that we are creatures of the highest order, worthy of representing the One who created us. For every fault that we may have, after exhausting all excuses, the only one to blame is God Himself, for He created us with all our bad traits; we did not create ourselves. Also, He can foresee all the outcomes that these bad traits wrought, those traits that He imparted in us. But as we had said, we must look at the final result, only then can we have an understanding. As people say: \"Don't show a fool an item before it is completed\". ", 
        "Our Rabbi's have taught, that the reason for God creating the world is to benefit and give enjoyment to His creatures. This should be our focus, because this is God's thought and purpose in creating the world. And we should realize, that the enjoyment that a person receives is in direct proportion, to the person's desire for that enjoyment. The greater the desire, the greater the enjoyment. (Receiving a penny, brings no enjoyment, because there is no desire for a penny. Receiving $5,000 brings with it great enjoyment, because of the great desire). As part of God's plan in creating the world, He had to create a great desire within the soul, within the person. If there is no desire, there is no enjoyment.", 
        "Now that we know this (that desire and pleasure go hand-in-hand). We can answer our second inquiry, which was, what is the \"something from nothing\" that God created. That God created something, not found in God Himself (from nothing).  And now, that we also know that the purpose of creation was to benefit and give enjoyment to those that were created, it must be then, what God created, something completely new, not found in God Himself, this \"something\" is the desire to receive God's goodness. For as we had said, that desire and enjoyment go hand-in-hand. This desire to receive is not found in God Himself, because from whom would He receive (He is complete, and has no need to receive anything). The desire to receive, is the \"something\" that was created from \"nothing\", since the desire to receive is not found in God Himself. It is now also understood, that the desire to receive was all that God needed to create, in order to fulfill his goal, which is to benefit and give enjoyment to us.  That enjoyment though, did not have to be created anew, it was always within Him. We can now conclude for certainty, that all of creation from beginning to end, all that God needed to create, in order to fulfill His purpose, was to create the \"desire to receive\".", 
        "Now we can understand what the kabbalists say, when they compare the soul to a stone quarried from a mountain. Just as a stone was a part of the mountain, so to the soul was a part of God. And we wondered ( in our third inquiry), the stone is separated from a mountain with a special tool, but what is it that separated the soul from God, that now it is called soul and not the Creator Himself. But now it is understood well. In the physical world there are tools that separate the stone from the mountain, however, in the spiritual worlds there are no objects, there is no space, there are only desires. What separates, or combines two spiritual beings is their desires. If their desires have \"similarity of form\" i.e. the same desires, they connect, if they have opposite desires they separate. We see this also in our physical world. Two friends who have the same interests, same desires, are close, no matter the distance between them. However, two people who have different interests, different desires, are \"far apart\" no matter how physically close they are one to the other.    ", 
        "You now realize that in spirituality the \"difference of form\", differences in desires, acts like an ax that splits an item into two. And also, that distance in spirituality, is measured according to the \"difference of form\", difference of desires, between spiritual entities. You can now understand, that since God implanted the desire to receive in the soul, to receive all the goodness that He wanted to give; this desire to receive, separated the soul from God who has an opposite desire, a desire only to give.  However, concerning God's goodness, the light that the creations receive, in that aspect, there is no difference between them and the Creator. The difference occurs when the light is shaped in the desire to receive, the vessel that accepts this light. The light that was received , because it is in the vessel of the \"desire to receive\", has now separated from the original light, and is now only a \"part\" of the  original light, and is no longer the \"whole\". One becomes the \"part\", while the other is the \"whole\", as a stone quarried from a mountain. Contemplate this carefully, because it is not possible to explain these lofty matters at length.  ", 
        "We now have an opening to understand the fourth inquiry: How it is possibly that evil emanated from God's holiness, since evil and holiness are complete opposites, and also, how is it possible that He sustains evil. But we need to understand the source of evil, that evil comes from the great desire to receive which is the essence of all the souls that were created, because only through the desire to receive, can the souls receive all the fulfillment that God had in store for them. However, the desire to receive for oneself cannot remain in this state. For if it did, the souls would be in permanent separation from the creator. For they are opposites, one a desire to receive, the other a desire to give, they can never bond. In order to fix this separation, God created two systems, as it is written \"this one, versus that one, did God establish\". One system, the four worlds (levels within oneself) of holiness, the other, the four worlds of impurity. These worlds (levels) are known by the acronym ABYA, they are: Azilut, Beriya, Yetzirah and Asiya. He implanted the desire to give in the system of ABYA of holiness, and the desire to receive for oneself in the ABYA of impurity. The desire to receive is now separated from the Creator, and from all the worlds (levels) of holiness. For this reason, the \"shells\"(evil) are called \"dead\" as it is written \"sacrifices of the dead\".  The wicked are also called \"dead\", as it is written \"the wicked in their lifetime are called dead\". This is because the evil within them, the \"opposite of form\" (opposite of desires), separates them from the life force of the universe (God), and they are distanced from Him an infinite distance. For He has no desire to receive, but only to give, and the \"shells\" (evil) have no desire to give, but only to receive for themselves, and there is no greater opposite of desires than that. And you already know, distance in spirituality is measured according to the difference in \"form\" (desires), and these opposite desires cause the maximum distance between God and those that He created.", 
        "And the spiritual worlds evolved to the reality of our physical world, where a person is born with a [spiritual] body (the desire to receive) and a soul (the desire to give), a time of decay and a time of rebuilding (tikun). For the [spiritual] body, the  desire to receive for oneself, which has its roots in the thought of creation, travels through the system of impurity, as it is written \" a newborn is like a wild  donkey\", and remains subservient to this system until the age of thirteen. This then is the time of [spiritual] decay (because the person is mostly thinking of himself). And through his involvement in mitzvot beginning at thirteen, for the purpose of causing pleasure to His creator (by becoming a giver), he slowly switches from the desire that was ingrained within him, the desire to  receive, and turns it into a desire to give. That person has now entered into the system of holiness, and is acquiring a soul (the desire to give), whose roots are also in the thought of creation. This then is the time of rebuilding (tikun). The person adds and acquires levels of holiness, (by becoming more of a giver), and thus fulfilling the purpose of creation which is [known by the term] \"Ein-Sof\".  These levels of holiness help change a person's desires for himself, and help make him a \"receiver in order to give\" where giving and receiving become one.  At that point he acquires \"similarity of form\" with his Creator.  Because receiving in order to give is considered complete giving. This is mentioned in Tractate Kiddushin 7a: Someone important, who is the groom, if the bride puts the ring on his finger, and the groom said: \"you are hereby married to me with this ring\", they are married. (Usually it is the groom who puts the ring on the bride, however, in the above scenario, the groom who usually doesn't accept gifts, (because he is an important person), by accepting her ring (gift), he gives her pleasure, and with this pleasure she is married to him). We see then, that by receiving (the gift) the groom is actually giving [pleasure to the bride]. Because his receiving in order to give his bride [pleasure] is considered pure giving. Such a person when it comes to his relationship with God, who accepts from Him, in order to make God happy, acquires \"similarity of form\" with God, (they are now both givers) and can now receive all the goodness that was the purpose of the Creator, when He creating the world."
