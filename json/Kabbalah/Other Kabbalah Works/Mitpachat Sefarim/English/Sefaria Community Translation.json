            "This author will explain that there is reason to suspect that Rabbi Moshe De Leon sent his hand onto the text of the Zohar that came into his possession and if he did not write the entirety of the text [from scratch] he at least wrote part of it. At the very least, there is no way to escape the conclusion that Raya Meheimana and the Tikkunei Zohar are certainly, without any doubt or uncertainty whatsoever the work of the hands of a Sefardic Kabalist, and he hanged [his words] on a great tree in accordance with the advice of Rabbi Akiva to Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai. This is attested through many strong proofs that are \"as strong as a molten mirror\" which are unanswerable.",
            "",
            "Is it not seen from the quotations above that the Zohar explains the verse [in Ezekiel 1:27] with reference to a Synagogue called an Esnoga and the appearance of shining with reference to a Synagogue called an Esnoga.",
            "You should wonder to yourself where the author of the Zohar got the idea that a Synagogue is called Esnoga. This name is not found in the Bible, the targums, the two talmuds (The Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds), nor in the many Midrashim of the Talmudic Sages that are in our hands. This name is, however, found in Spanish [i.e Ladino] where they do call a Synagogue Esnoga. (If you wonder how I know this given that I don't know Spanish, you hear the Sefardim in our area using this name for a house of prayer. You can also look at the responsa of the AMaH of blessed memory (Responsum 38) where they sent a question in the foreign language of Ladino which is translated to Hebrew and we see the [Ladino] word Esnoga under the [Hebrew word for] Synagogue.)  He quotes this word on 2 occassions to explain the verses. It is not believable that these are the words of the Talmudic Sages who wrote the Talmud, even Ravina and Rav Ashi, or the Saforaim or even the Geonim in Babylon because none of them knew Ladino (let alone Rashbi the Tana whom only an extreme simpleton could attribute this too.) Rather [you could suggest] the author used an idea well-known to people  and used to explain the mystical meaning of the text, so too with Ezekiel's chariot vision but this seems very far-fetched and foreign to me. Rather, the truth appears to be that this and everything like it found in this book is an addition by a Sefardi Kabalist"
