            "Introduction",
            "The Book of the War of the Lord, that informs the path of unique truths: it will be blessed according to the Torah and the explanations of the Sages in the Mishnah, Babylonian Talmud, Jerusalem Talmud, Midrashim of the Sages, and like the understanding of the Ge'onim - Rav Saadia Ga'on, Rabbenu Bahye in Duties of the Heart, Yehuda Halevi in his songs, and in the Kuzari, Maimonides, and the author of Sefer Mitzwoth Gadholoth, and Rav Yoseph Albo, like it is transmitted down to every man of Israel. And with  it, an intense warning not to worship any creature as the acceptance of all our prophets and all our Sages: the Tannaim, the Amoraim, the Geonim, and the first legal decisiors, Moshe and Aaron, and the elders.",
            "Know that a great reader will not understand this book after reading. A great reader will not change themselves. This is because the author worked day and night, weary and meticulously, in many books to get strong evidence. He came out with a mind full of things and therefore I ask you as a worthy reader not to come in Esau's agony, but with Jacob's voice. I also ask you to look at things and those who are powerless without the ability to speak. G-d Almighty will give you mercy and protect us his people Israel. ",

            "Shaul asked one of the students, may he rest in peace, and he informed us who we are praying to in the prayer and the worship. For the sake of the elevations in \"and\" or for the Nazir whom we are nazir of (Z'a), as he explained to us in your ears, may peace be upon him, King David who went from here to the Holy Land according to the true faith as is explained in the book of Mitzvah of Faith and in the book of AHT that the servant who serves without end serves without a true God and without a God of justice, so that we know whom we serve. Your answer quickly, my lord, Amen.",
            "The answer is explained in the book Kesse Eliyahu, pages 13 to 18, by the wise and learned, Yeshuah Lekach. And it is accepted among us that worshiping only one Lord has an influence that extends to ten sefirot, as written by Lechem Shlomo. Thus, concludes the reply."
