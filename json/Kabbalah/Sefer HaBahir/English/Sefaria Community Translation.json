        "When the Torah says that Adam was “in the image of God, male and female” (Genesis 1:27), it means that the androgynous Adam was created in the form of the revealed emotional aspects of God, which is also androgynous. The Hebrew word Tzela, usually translated as “rib,” actually should be translated as “side” according to the standard Aramaic translation of the Bible. When the Bible states, “He took one of his ribs,” it actually means “one of his sides,” that is, the feminine side. The concept of the Male is that of giving, while the Female is that of receiving, holding, and giving birth. Thus, without the Female, creation could neither take place nor endure. "
