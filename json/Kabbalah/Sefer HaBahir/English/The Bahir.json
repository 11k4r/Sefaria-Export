        "Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana said: ",
        "One verse ( Job 37:21 ) states, \"And now they do not see light, it is brilliant (Bahir) in the \nskies... [round about God in terrible majesty].\" ",
        "Another verse, however, (Psalm 18:12), states, \"He made darkness His hiding place.\" It is \nalso written (Psalm 97:2), \"Cloud and gloom surround Him.\" This is an apparent \ncontradiction. ",
        "A third verse comes and reconciles the two. It is written (Psalm 139:12), \"Even darkness is \nnot dark to You. Night shines l ik e day — light and darkness are the same.\" \n"
