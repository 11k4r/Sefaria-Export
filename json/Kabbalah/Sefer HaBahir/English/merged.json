        "Rabbi Reḥumai sat and expounded: What is Filled with the בִּרְכַּת (birkat), blessing, of YHWH. To the יָם (yam), west, and the south His possession (Deuteronomy 33:23)? It means that everyplace of ב (bet) is בָּרוּך (barukh), blessed, and this is: filled with the בִּרְכַּת (birkat), blessing, of YHWH. From there it gives to drink those who need it. It was from this filling that He sought advice. What is this like? A king wanted to build his palace among great cliffs. He mined into the bedrock and uncovered a great spring of living water. The king then said, “Since I have flowing water, I will plant a garden. Then I will delight in it, and so will all the world.” Therefore it is written And I was by Him an intimate, I was His delight day after day playing before Him at all times (Proverbs 8:30). Torah is saying, “For two thousand years I was in the lap of the blessed Holy One as His delight.” Therefore the verse reads: day after day [lit., יוֹם יוֹם  (yom yom), a day, a day]. Each day of the blessed Holy One is a thousand years, as it is written, For a thousand years in Your eyes are like yesterday gone (Psalms 90:4, cf. BT Sanhedrin 97a).? Hence, thereafter: at times—as it is said, [playing before Him] at all times. And the rest is לְעוֹלָם (le-olam), forevermore. Thus it is said I defer My anger, and for My praise will I restrain it for you (Isaiah 48:9). What is My praise? As it is written, A David song of praise. Let me exalt You, [my God the king] (Psalms 145:1-2). Why is this praise? Because I will exalt You. And what is this exaltation? Let me bless Your name לְעוֹלָם (le-olam), forevermore (ibid.).",

I am the one that planted this tree/ilan, [for] all the world to delight in, and I hammered out all/kol with him (the tree), and I called his name “the Whole/All /hakol”, for all depends on him, and all comes out from him.
