            "You asked me, brother, dear friend, to clarify in front of you a path about the names of the Holy One, Blessed be He, the Exalted and Almighty, to produce throught them according your will and to reach [your] place throught them according your desire. And by seeing that your intention is honest and good enough by your question, I had to let you know which way to spread light and what is the way that HaShem Almighty desires or does not desire. And when you get to know this then call HaShem to response. And you will be closest to him. And love Him with all your soul, and rejoyce on HaShem. And He will give you the answers of your heart.", 
            "Do you not know? Have you not heard? Hashem is the L-rd of the Universe, before Him tremble all of the upper worlds and lower worlds, from the fear of Him the earth trembles and before His wrath who can stand? (Nahum 1:6) Who shall rise before His anger? He places no trust even in His holy ones, and even the heavens do not merit in his eyes. How much less man who is vile and corrupt and who drink wickedness like water. (Job 15: 15-16). How may a mortal use the His holy names and make from them an axe to chop with? Who is he who conspired to do so? To snatch the kingly crown for his own personal use? Behold, our sages have said: anyone who utters the name of Hashem according to the way it is written has no share in the world to come. The holy Rabbi Chanina ben Tradion did not utter Hashem's name in a profane manner or for his own use, rather in a manner of respect in order to learn and understand the ways of Hashem blessed be He and he was still punished, we who are (spiritually) impoverished and  lacking, how much more so!?",
