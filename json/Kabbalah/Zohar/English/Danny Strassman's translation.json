Rabbi Elazar said to him, \"Leave it, don't kill it.\" [Rabbi Chizkiya] responded, \"But it's a bad thing, for it kills people.\"  [Rabbi Elazar] said to Rabbi Chizkiya, \"But it says in the verse (Koheles 10:11) 'If a snake will kill without a whisper'.  A snake does not bite a person until he is whispered to from Above to kill the person...",
