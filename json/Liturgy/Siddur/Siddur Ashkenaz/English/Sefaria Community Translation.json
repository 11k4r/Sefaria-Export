Abaye said: Therefore, we will say the blessing while standing, in honor of the Divine Presence. (Sanhedrin 42a) Who is she that comes up from the desert, Leaning upon her beloved? (Song of Songs 8:5) May it be willed before You, oh Lord, my God and God of my fathers to fill the blemish of the moon so that it should have no longer any smallness. Let the light  of moon be like the light of the sun, like the light of the seven days of creation as it was before its diminution as it says “…the two great lights…” (Genesis 1:16) Let the verse be fulfilled for us as it is written “…and they will seek the LORD their God and David their king…” (Hoshea 3:5) Amen.",

Nations will exult and shout for joy, for You rule the peoples with equity, You guide the nations of the earth. Selah. The peoples will praise You, O God; all peoples will praise You. May the earth yield its produce; may God, our God, bless us. May God bless us, and be revered to the ends of the earth. (Psalm 67)",

(For they worship vanity and emptiness, and pray to a god who cannot save.) We bend the knee and bow, acknowledging the Supreme Sovereign, the Holy One, exalted, who spread out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, whose glorious abode is in the loftiest heights. This is our G-d; there is no other. In truth, G-d alone is our Ruler, as it is written in the Torah: \"Know this day and take it to heart that Adonai is G-d in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other.\"",
                    "And so we hope in You, Adonai our G-d, soon to see Your splendor: that You will sweep idolatry away so that false gods will be utterly destroyed, and that You will perfect the world by Your sovereignty so that all humanity will invoke Your name, and all the earth's wicked will return to You, repentant. Then all who live will know that to You every knee must bend, every tongue pledge loyalty. To You, Adonai, may all bow in worship. May they give honor to Your glory; may everyone accept Your dominion. Reign over all, soon and for all time. Sovereignty is Yours in glory, now and forever. Thus it is written in Your Torah: \"Adonai reigns for ever and ever.\" Such is the prophetic assurance: \"Adonai shall be acknowledged Ruler of all the earth. On that day Adonai shall be One and G-d's name One.\""
