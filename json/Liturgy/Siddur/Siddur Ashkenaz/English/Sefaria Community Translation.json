And the Greek king forced me to write my religion in Greek. \"Those who plow use my back to plow, they make the furrow long.\" I fumed on the Ninth with deep-dug shame. He removed from me the cloak of glory and alacrity. The one who had said beautiful words was torn apart on that day. This was Ezra the Scribe. (Ezekiel) Ben Buzi the Visionary was commanded about the Tenth day. He wrote for You in his book of visions. For a remembrance for a nation who is melted and disgraced. \"This very day.\" The count of the monthly calendar was awakened against me. I stretch out my mouth with dirges and wailing. The order of the tragedies will burn in my heart. When \"the refugee came to me saying the city had been hit.\" About these, I throw dirt on my face. I have been wounded by these four things- if only I had shot an arrow into my heart! In distress over these, I dig myself a grave. \"God is justified, because I transgressed his word.\" I called Your name, the One comforted about my evil doings. See my suffering, hear the voice of my supplication. Listen to my pleas, quicken my salvation. \"Do not shut your ear to my cry for ease, to my appeal.\" In the month of Tevet I was very hard-hit.
