                "<b>Berachoth: Chapter One</b> From what time on may we read the Sh'm'a of the evening? \"From the time the priests enter to eat their Terumah until the end of the first watch,\" said R. Eliezer. But the other sages say \"Until midnight,\" and Rabban Gamaliel says \"Until the appearance of the morning star.\" It happened that the sons of Rabban Gamaliel came [very late at night] from a banquet and told Rabban Gamaliel that they had not yet read the Sh'm'a, whereupon he said to them: \"If the morning star has not yet appeared you must read it.\"", 
                "", 
                "(Gemara) Let us see: when do the priests enter to eat the Terumah? Is it not when the stars appear? Let then the Mishnah say: \"From the time the stars appear!\" In using this expression, he lets us hear something by the way; namely, that with the appearing of the stars, the priests are allowed to eat their Terumah, because the forgiveness-offering [which will be brought on the morrow] is not a hindrance, as we have been taught: \"And when the sun hath set, he shall be clean\" (Lev. 22:7.) i.e., the waiting for the setting of the sun prevents him from eating the Terumah, but not his forgiveness-offering.", 
                "", 
                "R. Jose said: \"Twilight lasts as long as a twinkling; this one comes and that one goes, and it is impossible to determine its exact time.\"", 
                "\"Until the end of the first watch,\" said R. Eliezer. Let us see: with whom does R. Eliezer agree? If he hold that the night is divided into three watches, then let him say \"until the end of the fourth hour\"; and if he hold that the night is divided into four watches, then let him say \"Until the end of the third hour?\" He holds indeed that the night has three watches, but he intends to inform us that just as there exist watches in Heaven, so there exist watches here on the earth; as we are taught that R. Eliezer says: \"Three watches has the night; and at the beginning of every watch the Holy One, praised be He! sits and roars like a lion, as it is said (Jer. 25:30) \"The Lord will roar from Heaven on high and from His holy dwelling shall He give forth His voice.\" Verily, He will roar over His habitation. And the divisions of the night are recognized by these signs: In the first watch the ass brays; in the second the dog barks; and in the third the baby nurses from its mother's breast and the wife converses with her husband.\"", 
                "How does R. Eliezer arrive at these conclusions? Does he apply the signs to the beginning or to the end of each watch? If he applies his signs to the beginning of each watch, then it is unnecessary to have a sign for the first, as nightfall itself is a sufficient indication for it! If, however, he applies his signs to the end of each watch then the sign for the last is unnecessary, for the dawn is then sufficient! He applies his signs to the end of the first watch, the beginning of the last and the middle of the second. And if you please, you may say that he applies his signs to the end of each watch. In answer to your question as to the necessity of a sign for the last, I say: It is necessary for a man who sleeps in a dark place and does not know the time for reading the Sh'm'a; as soon as he hears the wife conversing with her husband, and the baby nursing from its mother's breast, he may begin to read the Sh'm'a.", 
                "R. Isaac b. Samuel in the name of Rab said: \"Three watches has the night and at the beginning of every watch the Holy One, praised be He! sits and roars like a lion and says 'Woe to the children that because of their sins I have destroyed my edifice, and burned my Temple, and exiled my children among the heathens.'\"", 
                "We are taught that R. Jose says: \"once upon a time I was walking on a road and I entered one of the ruins of Jerusalem to pray. Elijah, blessed be his memory! came and watched me at the door until I finished my prayer. After I had finished, he said to me: 'Shalom, (peace, unto thee), my teacher,' to which I answered, 'Shalom, my teacher and my guide.' 'My son,' said he, 'why did you enter this ruin?' 'To pray,' I replied. 'You could have prayed on the road,' he said. 'I was afraid lest I be interrupted by travelers.' 'You should then have prayed a short prayer.' From this conversation, I concluded three things: First: It is not safe to enter a ruin. Second: One is permitted to pray on the road, and third: A man on the road [having no place to pray] has the privilege of saying a short prayer. He then said to me: \"What voice did you hear in this ruin?' 'I heard,' I replied, 'a Bath-Kol (heavenly voice) which coos like a dove, saying, 'Woe to the children that because of their sins I have destroyed my edifice, burned my Temple, and exiled my children among the heathens.' 'My son,' said he again, '[I swear] by your life and the life of your head, that this occurs not only at that particular time, but thrice daily; furthermore, every time Israelites enter the Synagogues or places of learning and answer 'Let his great name be praised,' the Holy One, praised be He! nods His head, and says, 'Happy is the king thus praised in his own house, but what availeth it a father who hath exiled his children among the heathens? Woe to the children who have been exiled from their father's table!'\"", 
                "Our Rabbis have taught: For three reasons shall no person enter a ruin; because of suspicion (of an immoral intention); because the ruin may cave in; and on account of demons (dwelling in ruins).", 
                "Our Rabbis have taught: \"The night has four watches,\" so says Rabbi. R. Nathan says \"Three.\" What is R. Nathan's reason? It is written (Judges 6:19) \"And Gidon, and the hundred men that were with him, came the edge of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch. And we are taught that Tichon (middle) cannot be used unless something precedes and something follows it. But Rabbi disputes this and says that \"by the middle is meant one of the two middles.\" R. Nathan says: \"Is it then written one of the middles? Behold! It is written the middle!\" What is Rabbi's reason? R. Zerika in the name of R. Ami, who speaks in the name of R. Joshua ben Levi, said: \"One passage says (Ps. 119:62) 'At midnight do I constantly rise to give thanks unto Thee,' etc., and another passage says (Ps. 119:148) 'My eyes are awake before the night watches. How is this possible? At midnight; because the night is divided into four watches, [midnight is therefore after two watches.]\" But R. Nathan explains it by the statement of R. Joshua; as we are taught that R. Joshua says: \"It is the custom of kings to rise on the third hour of the day. [i.e., six hours of the night and two hours of the day together make two night watches of four hours each]. R. Ashi said: \"One watch and a half are also called watches (plural).\"", 
                "Another thing said R. Zerika in the name of R. Ami, who speaks in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi: \"In the presence of the dead it is not proper to speak of anything except things concerning the dead.\" R. Abba b. Cahana said: \"This refers only to affairs of the Torah, but worldly affairs do not matter.\" But some say that R. Abba b. Cahana said: \"This refers to affairs of the Torah and even more positively to worldly affairs.\"",

                "17...(Ib. b) We are taught: The sages made a fence to their words [to protect their ordinances], lest a man coming from the field in the evening, would say: \"I will go home, eat a little, drink a little, and sleep a while and then I will read Sh'm'a and pray the evening service.\" In the meantime he will fall asleep and sleep through the whole night without having read the Sh'm'a or prayed. But [in order to prevent this they say:] \"A man coming from the field in the evening shall enter the synagogue, and if he be accustomed to read the Scripture, let him do so ; or if he be able to study traditional law, let him do that. After this, he should read the Sh'm'a and pray ; then he can eat his meal and recite the Aftermeal Benediction. He who transgresses the words of the wise, deserves the penalty of death.\" Why docs the Baraitha use the expression here that \"He who transgresses the words of the wise is worthy of the penalty of death,\" and not use it in any other place? If you wish, you may say, because here the force of sleep puts him beyond his own control [and if he is not strongly warned against it, he may transgress the command even though he really desires to fulfill it] ; and if you please, you may say, because it is the intention [of the Baraitha] to reverse the opinion of those who say that the evening service is only optional it tells us, therefore, [by its warning,] that it is obligatory. The master said [above] : \"He reads the Sh'm'a and prays (the evening service)\" This is in support of [the view of] R. Jochanan, who was accustomed to say: \"Who is sure to have a share in the world to come? He. who, immediately after the benediction of Geula, says the prayer of the Eighteen Benedictions at the evening service.\" R. Joshua b. Levi said : \"The Eighteen Benedictions were ordained to be said in the middle.\" On what do they base their difference of opinion? If you please, you may say on a Biblical passage, and if you please, you may say on common sense. As to reason, R. Joshua holds that the redemption (of Egypt) commenced on the evening (towards the fifteenth of Nisan) although the real redemption did not take place until the morning, [therefore the Ge-ula which indicates the redemption should be said immediately before the Eighteen Benedictions in the evening also] ; but R. Joshua b. Levi holds that as long as the real redemption did not take place until the morning then the redemption of the evening matters little. As to the Biblical passage they differ in the interpretation of the passage. (Deu. 6:7) And when thou lieth down, and when thou riseth up, (referred to Sh'm'a) . R. Jochanan holds: \"We compare Lying down [at evening] to arising [in the morning] for the reason that just as the reading of the Sh'm'a in the morning comes before the prayer, so, in the evening, the reading of the Sh'm'a comes first also, and then the prayer of the Eighteen Benedictions.\" R. Joshua holds: \"We compare the reading of the Sh'm'a when lying down to the reading of the Sh'm'a when arising, for the reason that just as in the morning the Sh'm'a is read close upon rising so is the Sh'm'a of the evening read just before lying down.\" The following objection was raised by Mar b. Rabina: \"We have learned (in a Mishnah) 'In the evening, he says two benedictions before the Sh'm'a and two after the Sh'm'a.' If the Eighteen Benedictions should be said immediately after Ge-ula, then the Benedictions of Hash-ki-benu, prevents his having the Ge-ula, (the first one after Sh'm'a) closely after the Eighteen Benedictions?\" Since the Rabbis ordained that Hash-ki-benu is to be said [between Ge-ula and the Eighteen Benedictions] then it is considered as one long benediction ; for if we do not say so, then in the morning how can we say the Eighteen Benedictions immediately after the Ge-ula? Has not R. Jochanan said : \"He should first say, O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise (Ps. 51:17), and then proceed with the Eighteen Benedictions; and at the conclusion he should say. May the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer, (Ib. 19, 15).\" But since the Rabbis ordained that the passage [O Lord, open my mouth, etc. ] be said, it is considered one long prayer (part of the eighteen benedictions), so in this instance also, since the Rabbis ordained that the Hash-ki-benu be said between Ge-ula and the Eighteen Benedictions, it is considered a part of Ge-ula1", 
                ".18..R. Elazar b. Abina said : \"He who recites Te-hila l' David (Ps. 145) three times a day may be sure of an inheritance in the world to come.\" What is the reason? Shall I say because that particular chapter is arranged alphabetically? Then why not prefer chapter 119 Ps., which has an arrangement of eight repetitions of each letter of the alphabet? Is it because it has the verse Thou openeth Thy hand and satisfieth the demands of all Thy creatures. [it influences men to be benevolent] ? If so, then why not the Great Hallel? in which also is written (Ib. 136, 25.) He giveth food to all flesh. Because Tehila l' David has the advantages of both; [is arranged alphabetically and influences men to be benevolent].", 
                "R. Jochanan said : \"Why is the letter Nun missing in the [alphabetical course of] Ashrei? Because the letter Nun is used for bad tidings. It is said (Amos 5:2) She is fallen (Nafla) and will not rise again, the virgin of Israel.\" In Palestine they interpret [this prophecy of Amos as good tidings] thus: She is fallen and will not fall again! Rise! virgin of Israel! R. Nachman b. Isaac said: \"Even so, David indicates [the prophecy of] the Nun for the purpose of strengthening Israel, through a holy vision; for he says (Ps. 145:14) The Lord upholdeth all who are fallen (Noflim).\"", 
                "R. Elazar b. Abina said further: \"Much more is said [regarding the actions] of Michael than is said of Gabriel; for in describing Michael, it is written (Is. 6, 6.) Then flew unto me one of the Seraphim. Whereas in describing Gabriel it is written (Dan. 9:21) The man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came flying swiftly.\" And whence do we know that the word Echad (one) [mentioned by Isaiah] refers to Michael ? R. Jochanan said : \"We derive it from the word Echad which occurs in both passages; it is written here (Is. 6, 6.) One of the Seraphim and it is written there (Dan. 10:13) But Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me. [Just as in the latter case] the word Echad (one) is applied to Michael, so also in the former case does Echad (one) apply to Michael].\" In a Baraitha it was taught : \"Michael [reaches his destination] with one [flight] ; Gabriel with two; Elijah with four and the angel of death with eight ; but during an epidemic the angel of death reaches [his destination] with one [flight].\"", 
                "(Fol. 5a) R. Levi b. Chama, in the name of Simon b. Lakish said: \"At all times let man stir up his good inclination against the evil inclination), for it is said (Ps. 4:5) Tremble, and sin not. If he conquers it (the evil inclination) it is well, but if he does not, then he should study the Torah ; for we read, (Ib.) Commune with your heart. If it goes away, then it is well, but if not he should then read the Sh'm'a; for it is said (Ib.) Upon your bed. If he conquers it, then it is well, but if not, he should then remind himself of the day of death, for it is written. And be still Selah (to the end).\" R. Isaac said : \"Whoever reads the Sh'm'a when on his bed is considered [protected] as if he were holding a two-edged sword in his hand, for it is written (Ps. 149:6) The exalted praises (of God) are in their mouths and the two-edged sword in their hands.\" How does he infer this? Mar Zutra and according to others, R. Ashi, said : \"From the beginning of that passage (Ib. ib. 5.) Let the pious be joyful in glory; let them, sing aloud upon their beds; and it is written after this The exalted praise of God is in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their hands.\" Furthermore, said R. Isaac: Whoever reads the Sh'm'a on his bed [before sleep], will cause the departure of all evil spirits; for it is said (Job 5:7) And the sons of fire take up their flight. By Uf (flight) is meant nothing else but the Torah, as it is said (Pr. 23, 5.) When thou letteth merely thine eyes fly over it (i. e., if thou learneth the Torah superficially), it is no more. And reshef (fire) means nothing else but evil spirits; as it is said (Deu. 32:24) Devoured with burning heat and with bitter deadly disease.\"", 
                "Furthermore, said R. Levi b. Chama, in the name of Resh Lakish : \"What is meant by the passage (Ex. 24:12) And I will give thee the tablets of stone, with the law and the Commandments, which I have written to teach them? i.e, the tablets of stone, refers to the ten commandments; the Torah, refers to the Bible; the commandments, refers to the Mishnah; which I hare written, refers to the Prophets and Hagiographa ; to teach them, refers to the Gemara ; whence we infer that — all were given unto Moses on Mt. Sinai.\"...", 
                "23.R. Simon b. Lakish said : \"Whoever studies the Torah will prevent affliction from coming upon him, for it is said (Job 5:7), And the sons of fire take up their flight. By Uf (flight) is meant nothing else but the Torah, as it is said (Pr. 23, 5.) When thou letteth merely thine eye fly over it (i.e., if you study the Torah by merely glancing over it with your eyes), it is no more, (you will easily forget it). And Reshef (fire) means nothing else but affliction, as it is said (Deu. 32:24) Devoured with evil spirits.\" \"Aye.\" exclaimed R. Jochanan, \"even the school children know this! for it is said, (Ex. 15:2:5.) And he said, if thou wilt deligently hearken unto the voice of the Lord and wilt do what is riqht in His eyes, etc. But it means thus: Upon him who is capable of studying the Torah, but does not do so the Holy One, praised be He ! will bring repulsive suffering which will greatly disturb him ; for it is said (Ps. 39:3) I was dumb in deep silence, I was quite still even from speaking good, but my pain greatly disturbed me. By tob (good) is meant nothing else but the Torah, for it is said (Pr. 4, 2.) For good doctrine do I give, etc.\" R. Zeira, and some say, R. Chanina b. Papa, said : \"Come and see that the custom of the Holy One. praised be He! is not like the custom of mortal men. The custom of mortal men is that if a man sell a valuable thing to his fellow-man, the seller is sorry and only the buyer is happy; but the custom of the Holy One, praised be He! is not so. He bestowed the Torah on Israel and He rejoiced, for it is said (Ib. 4, 2.) For good doctrine do I give thee.\" Raba, and according to others R. Chisda, said: \"If a man see that troubles are coming unto him, let him search his deeds, for it is said, (Lam. 3:40) Let us search through and examine our ways and let us return unto the Lord. If he has investigated and found nothing wrong, then let him attribute it to a neglect of the study of the Torah. for it is said (Ps. 94:12) Happy is the man whom Thou admonisheth, O Lord, and teacheth out of Thy Torah. But if he investigated and did not find [neglect of the study of the Torah] then it is known that his affliction is the cause of God's love, for it is said (Pr. 3, 12.) Because whomsoever the Lord loveth He admonisheth.\" Raba, in the name of R. Sechorah, who quoted R. Huna, said : \"Whomsover the Holy One, praised be He! loveth. He afflicteth, for it is said (Is. 53, 10.) But the Lord was pleased to crush him through disease. We might think that, even if he does not accept the affliction with resignation. It is therefore said (Ib.) When his soul hath brought the trespass-offering, i. e., just as a guilt offering must come with his acknowledgement, so also must this be accepted with resignation. And if he accept it with love what will be his reward? Then shall he see (his) seed live many days, (Ib.) and moreover his learning shall endure with him, as is said (Ib.) And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.\" As to affliction, there is a difference of opinion between R. Jacob b. Ide and R. Acha b. Chanina. One holds that all such affliction which does not prevent one from studying the Torah is one of love, for it is said (Ps. 94:12) Happy is the man whom Thou admonisheth, O Lord, and teacheth from Thy Torah; and the other holds that such affliction which does not prevent one from praying is one which comes from love, for it is said (Ps. 66:20) Blessed he God who hath not removed my prayer nor His kindness from me. R. Abba, the son of R. Chiya b. Abba, said : \"Thus said my father (R. Chiya) in the name of R. Jochanan; 'Both of these afflictions are the kind which come from love, for it is written (Pr. 3, 12.) Because whomsoever the Lord loveth He admonisheth; But what do we learn [from the passage] Thou teacheth him of the Torah. Do not read Tlamdenu (that he should be able to study the Torah) ; but read it Tlamdainu (Out of Thy Torah, Thou teacheth us) i. e., we learn from thine Torah [that one who is punished by God should be happy] namely, through the rule of a fortiori concerning the tooth and the eye ; that if the loss of a tooth or an eye [stricken out by the master] which affects only one member of the human body, frees the slave, how much more then are afflictions, which affect the whole human body, capable of cleaning one of evil.'\" And that is meant by R. Simon b. Lakish, for he said: \"It is said Convenant (Brith) in connection with the word salt, and it is said Convenant (Brith) in connection with the word affliction. Covenant by salt — as it is written (Lev. 2:13) Thou shalt not suffer the salt of the covenant (Brith) ! Covenant by affliction — as it is written (Deu. 28:49) These are the words of the covenant. (Brith) Just as the covenant of the salt was made to sweeten meat, so the covenant of affliction was made to cleanse man of all iniquities.\""

And I saw two crevices in the ground from which smoke issued. I took a piece of wool, wetted it with water, put it on my spear, placed it in the crevice, and when 1 took it out it was singed. And the merchant said to me: 'Listen! what do you hear?' And I heard them saying : 'Moses and his Torah are true, and we are liars.' The merchant said to me : 'Each thirtieth day of the month, Gehenna turns them over here, as flesh is turned over in the pot. and they say Moses and his Torah are true, and we are liars.' \" ", 
                "Rabba b. b. Chana said further: \"He said again to me: 'Come and I will show you where earth and heaven meet.' I followed him and saw it was made full of apertures. I took my basket, and put it on the window of the sky. After praying, I searched for it but could not find it. Then I said to the merchant: 'Are there, then, thieves here? And he answered: 'It was the sphere of the Zodiac, which turns around. Wait until tomorrow at this same time, and you will find it' \""
