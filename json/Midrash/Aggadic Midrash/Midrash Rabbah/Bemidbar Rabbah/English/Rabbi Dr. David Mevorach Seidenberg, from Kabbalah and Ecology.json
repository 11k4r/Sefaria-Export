            "And it was in the day of completing [the mishkan]” [Nu 7:1]—that is what’s written: “An apiryon he made for himself” [So 3:9]—this is the world, which is made like a kind of canopy; “ . . . Shlomo (Solomon) the king”—this is the Holy One who set peace/shalom between fire and water and kneaded them, this with this, and made from them the firmament . . . which is fire and water; “ . . . from the trees of L’vanon”—for [the world] was built from the place of the Temple/Beyt Hamiqdash (which was made of cedar from Lebanon) . . .Why is [the Temple] called foundation stone / even sh’tiyah? Because from it the world was founded /hushetet. “Its pillars he made silver” [So 3:10]—this is the firmament, as you would say, “the pillars of the heavens would shake loose /y’rof’fu” [Jb 26:11]—and why is it called silver/kesef? Because it covers/m’khasef over all the work of Creation . . . ; “ . . . its back /r’fidato gold” [So 3:10]—this is the earth, that raises fruits of the earth and fruits of the tree, which are like gold – as gold has many kinds and many colors, even so the fruits of the earth, some of them are green, some of them are red; “ . . . its chariot-seat /merkavo purple” [So 3:10]—this is the sun, who is placed above and who rides in a chariot and lights up the world, like what it says, “and he is like a bridegroom going out from his wedding-canopy/chuppah” [Ps 19:6], and from the power of the sun, the rains come down. . . and the earth raises fruits, and therefore they call [the sun] purple/argaman, for the Holy One formed him to weave /la’arog manna for the creatures, and there is no manna except for fruits and grains."
