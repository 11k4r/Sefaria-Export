            "...And God spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai. Why in the desert of Sinai? From here our sages taught [that] through three things Torah is given: fire, and water and desert. How do we know [Torah is given] through fire? 'and the mountain of Sinai was all full of smoke' (Exodus 19:18). And through water? '...also the Heavens, also the clouds dropped water' (Judges 5:4) And through the desert? 'And God spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai'. And why was it given through those three things? To point out that, just as these are free for all the inhabitants of the world, so too the words of Torah are free, as it is written 'Hey, everyone who is thirsty, go to water' (Isaiah 55:1). Another interpretation of 'And God spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai' - whoever does not make him/herself open to all [lit. ownerless], like a desert is not able to acquire wisdom and Torah, therefore it is written 'in the desert of Sinai'..."

From where do we learn the priesthood? As it is written “And did I choose him from all the tribes of Israel to be My priest…” (Shmuel I 2:28) From where do we learn the Levites? As it says “For the Lord, your God, has chosen him out of all your tribes…” (Devarim 18:5) From where do we learn Israel?

            "Another interpretation: \"Number all the first-born males...\" (Numbers 3:40) This is what is written (Song of Songs 6:8-9): \"There are threescore queens ... My dove, my undefiled, is but one ...\" Compare in parable to a person who had a sales-bundle of glass stones and would bring them them to the market, but would not notice their number, since he would not bring them out by number. He would go in to put them away and would not put them away by number, since he would not care about them, as they were glass. But he had one sales-bundle of precious pearls, and he would take it and bring it out by number and put it away by number. Similarly, so to speak, the Holy One Blessed be He said to the nations of the world, \"I have not assigned a number. Why? Because they are not important to me at all. As it says (Isaiah 40:17), 'All the nations are as nothing before Him.' But you are My children, as it says, (Isaiah 46:3), 'that are borne [by Me] from the birth ...' Therefore, I count you all the time.\" Therefore, it is said \"Number all the first-born males.\" That is: \"There are threescore queens ...

            "Man or woman, who does any of the sins etc. - Rabi Abahu says (Hosea 14:8): 'Those that dwell under His shadow' those are the gerim that come and have love for the shadow of the Holy One of Blessing. 'They shall grow as grain' in [the study of] Talmud. 'Shall blossom as vine' in [the study of] Aggadah. 'His memory/scent shall be as the wine of Lebanon' - said the Holy One of Blessing: \"The appreciation of the gerim is as dear to me as the wine that was poured on the altar [as libation.]\" And why does He call it [the altar] Lebanon (root LVN)? Because it whitens (maLViN) the sins of Israel like snow, as it is written (Isaiah 1:18) 'though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.' Rabi Shimon Bar Yochai says: because all the hearts (LeVavot) become happy due to it. As it says (Psalms 48:2): 'Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth.' And the rabbis say - because of the verse (II Kings 9:3) 'and My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.' Another interpretation: 'they will grow as grain' - they will make the essence, they are like Israel; as it is said (Zechariah 9:17) 'grain [for] the young men [of Israel]'. 'They shall blossom as vine', as [just like] Israel, as it says (Psalms 80:9) 'You plucked a vine from Egypt.' And so you find that, just as a portion of the Torah was written regarding one Israel and another - that if he misappropriated something of him, that he is obligated to a sacrifice, as it is written (Leviticus 5:21) 'If any one sin, and commit a trespass etc.' - so too you find that the Holy One of Blessing wrote a portion of the Torah regarding what goes on between Israel and gerim, that if a man from Israel steals from a ger, the judgement is as if he stole from another man from Israel. You find that regarding this it is written 'a sin that he sinned' and regarding stealing from a ger it is written 'from any sins of a man.' Regarding this one it is written 'and trespassed a trespass against the Lord' and regarding this one it is written 'to trespass a trespass against the Lord.' Regarding this one it is written: 'And it will be, when he sins and is guilty' and regarding the ger it is written 'and that soul will be guilty'. Regarding this one it is written: 'And he will pay with his head' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will return his guilt with his head'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will add his fifth' and regarding the ger it is written 'and he will add a fifth'. Regarding this one it is written: 'and he will bring his guilt-offering to the Lord' and regarding stealing a ger it is written 'besides the ram for the kipurim'. Behold we have learned: that the essence of the gerim is like Israel's. Therefore, they will be as grain and blossom.",

            "... “And David went and he took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh- gilead… And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son…” (Shmuel II 21:12-13) What did David do? He went and gathered all the elders and great ones of Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and came to Yavesh-gilead. He found the bones of SHaul and his son Yonatan, placed them in a casket and crossed back over the Jordan, as it says “And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father and they did all that the king commanded…” (Shmuel II 21:14) What does ‘in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father’ mean? It comes to teach us that they brought them to the border of Jerusalem and buried them there. Zela is next to Jerusalem, as it says “And Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite, which is Jerusalem…” (Yehoshua 18:28) ‘and they did all that the king commanded’ And what did the king command? He commanded that they carry Shaul’s casket from tribe to tribe. As Shaul’s casket entered each tribe’s territory all the men, women and children came out in order to perform an act of loving kindness to Shaul and his sons and thereby all of Israel would fulfill its obligation to loving kindness. This went on until they reached the land of his portion on the border of Jerusalem. Since the Holy One saw that they did loving kindness to Shaul and fulfilled the judgement of the Givonites He was immediately filled with mercy and sent rain upon the land, as it says “And God was entreated for the land after that.” (Shmuel II 21:14) From this we learn how close the Holy One brings those that are far away, even though they converted not for the sake of heaven. There is no need to even mention how he draws near righteous converts, “O Lord, all the kings of the earth will acknowledge You…” (Tehillim 138:4)",

            "The tabernacle (Mishkan). This is like that which is written \"How goodly are your tents, Jacob\" (Numbers 24:5). \"How goodly are your tents, Jacob\" this is the tent of meeting (ohel moed) that is in the wilderness and in Shiloh and Nov and Gibon. \"Your dwelling places, Israel\" (ibid). Don't read \"your dwelling\" (mishkenotecha) but your forfeits Israel (machknotecha) since the tabernacle and Temple were forfeited by Israel because of their sin. How do we know this is true of the sanctuary? As it is said \"the Temple at Shiloh was abandoned , the tent which man dwelt in\" (Psalm 88:60) since it was abandoned by Israel which are called \"man,\" i.e. The sheep of my shepherding, are men (Ezekiel 34:31). How do we know it is true of the Temple? Since it says \"he poured out his wrath; he lit a fire in Zion\" (Lamentations 4:11)and is further says \"we have dealt injured you (havul)\"(Nechemiah 1:7) . This is the first temple as it is said, \"If you take your neighbors garment in a pledge (havul) ( (Exodus 22:25). So it is called tabernalce (Mishkan) since God said to Moses: Say to Israel that I will make you a tabernacle (or pledge) but if you sin I will take it back from their hands."

Because it is written “God did not lead them [by] way of the land of the Philistines for it was near…” (Shemot 12:17) The oath which Avraham swore to Avimelech was still near in time, “And now, swear to me here by God, that you will not lie to me or to my son or to my grandson…” (Bereshit 21:23) His grandson was still alive. In the future the Holy One will permit Israel to conquer all three, as it says “And they shall fly of one accord against the Philistines in the west, together they shall plunder the children of the East; upon Edom and Moab shall they stretch forth their hand, and the children of Ammon shall obey them.” (Yeshayahu 11:14) And it is translated as ‘they will join shoulder to shoulder as one to wipe out the Phillistines.’ Therefore it says “…Philistia, join me…” (Tehillim 60:10), Edom and Moav are their occupation as it says “Moab is my washbasin; on Edom I will throw my lock…” (ibid.)

Shlomo said twenty-four songs of joy from the verse “But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth?” (Divre HaYamim II 6:18) to “And now, arise, O Lord God to Your resting place, You and the Ark of Your might…” (Divre HaYamim II 6:41) Twenty four verses and he was not answered.

In parallel to the seventy verses from the beginning of the book of Genesis to the curse of the snake. R’ Pichas said: there are two enemies who were not cursed until seventy verses had been completed about them – the snake and Haman the wicked. Regarding the snake, from “In the beginning…” (Genesis 1:1) until “…cursed be you more than all the cattle…” (Genesis 3:14) is seventy verses. Regarding Haman, from “After these events, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman…” (Esther 3:1) until “And they hanged Haman…” (Esther 7:10) is seventy verses. For the purpose of seventy he was hanged on fifty (cubits of wood). Another explanation. In parallel to the seventy holy names from ‘In the beginning’ until the story of the snake. And if you say there is one more (than seventy) “…and you will be like gods…” (Genesis 3:5) is not a holy name. Another explanation. In parallel to the seventy years before Terach gave birth to Avraham, as it says “And Terach lived seventy years…” (Genesis 11:26) Two people lived in two generations for seventy years. Kenan in the first generation, “And Kenan lived seventy years…” (Genesis 5:12) and Terach in the second generation. Another explanation.

Parallel to the seventy days of goodness which the Holy One gave to Israel – seven days of Passover, eight days of Sukkot, Rosh HaShanah, Yom Kippur, Shavuot and the fifty two days of Shabbat in the solar year make seventy. Another explanation. Parallel to the seventy names of the Holy One, the seventy names of Israel, the seventy names of the Torah, the seventy names of Jerusalem. Another explanation. Parallel to the seventy years that Adam took away from his life and gave to David ben Yishai. It was fit that he live for a thousand years, as it says “…for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die.” (Genesis 2:17) And a day to the Holy One is a thousand years, as it says “For a thousand years are in Your eyes like yesterday, which passed, and a watch in the night.” (Psalms 90:4)"

[If] one of you is impure by the dead [the highest type impurity], 2 or 3 drops are sprinkled on him, and you declare him pure?!\" He said to him, \"Has a restless spirit ever entered you?\" He said to him, \"No!\" \"Have you ever seen a man where a restless spirit entered him?\" He said to him, \"Yes!\" [Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai] said to him, \"And what did you do for him?\" He sad to him, \"We brought roots and made them smoke beneath him, and pour water and it flees.\" He said to him, \"Your ears should hear what leaves from your mouth! The same thing is true for this spirit, the spirit of impurity, as it is written, (Zachariah 13:2) \"Even the prophets and the spirit of impurity will I remove from the land.\" They sprinkle upon him purifying waters, and it [the spirit of impurity] flees.\" After he left, our rabbi's students said, \"You pushed him off with a reed. What will you say to us?\" He said to them, \"By your lives, a dead person doesn't make things impure, and the water doesn't make things pure. Rather, God said, 'I have engraved a rule, I have decreed a decree (chukah chakakti, gezeira gazarti), and you have no permission to transgress what I decreed, as it says \"This is a chok (rule) of the Torah.\"", 
            "\"Take the rod ... give the congregation and their cattle drink\" -- From here [we learn] that the Holy One takes pity on Israel's money. \"And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock\" -- similarly it says \"And all of the congregation he gathers to the door of the tent of meeting.\" This teaches that each one saw himself standing on the face of the rock. Likewise, when they crossed the Jordan, all of the Children of Israel entered between the staves of the ark, as it says (Joshua 3): \"Joshua said to the Children of Israel, come near and listen to the words of Hashem.\" [Similarly] here all of Israel were standing and seeing all of the miracles of the rock. They began to say \"Moses knows the rule of the rock. If he asks, it will bring forth water.\" So Moses was uncertain -- \"If I listen to them I nullify the words of the Allpresent, and the Holy One (Job 5:13) 'takes the wise in theןr craftiness.'\" But Moses had been careful for 40 years not to get angry at them, because he was terrified of the oath the Holy One swore: \"Not one of these men will see [the land]...\" They said to him: \"Here is a rock; just as you want to bring forth water from another rock, bring it forth from this one.\" He shouted at them \"Hear now, you rebels!\" \"Rebels (morim)\" has many meanings: 1) \"stubborn ones\" 2) \"fools\" -- in the sea villages they call fools \"morim\". 3) \"those who teach their teachers\" 4) \"archers\" (In I Sam 30:3 the word \"morim\" is used to mean \"archers\".)  ... Even so, Moses only used the rock that the Holy One told him [to use]."

            "\"And Balak son of Zippor saw\": The Torah says (Deuteronomy 32) \"The Rock--perfect is His work for all of His ways are justice.\" Hashem did not give the non-Jews an opening to say in the future \"You have distanced us.\" What did Hashem do? Just like He set up kings and sages and prophets for the Jews, He set these up for the non-Jews. He set up Shlomo as a king over the Jews and the entire earth, and He did the same for Nebuchadnezzar. This one built the Beit Hamikdash and said \"How many praises and supplications there are!\" and this one destroyed it and scoffed and said (Isaiah 14): \"I will ascend to the heights of the clouds.\" He gave David riches, and he took his house for His Name. And he gave Haman riches, and he took an entire nation to be slaughtered. All the greatness that the Jews took, you find that the nations took. Another example: He set up Moshe for the Jews and Bilaam for the nations. Understand what the difference is between Jewish prophets and non-Jewish prophets? Jewish prophets exhort the people about their sins, as it says (Ezekiel 3): \"And you, son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman etc.\" And the prophet from among the nations caused a breach to drive the creations from the world. Not only this, but all the prophets were [given prophecy] from the attribute of mercy on the Jews and the non-Jews, as Yirmiyah said (Jeremiah 48): \"My heart to Moav is as pipes moan.\" And as Yechezkel said (Ezekiel 27): \"Son of man, lament for Tyre.\" And this cruel one stood to uproot an entire nation for no reason. Therefore the passage of Bilaam was written, to make it known why Hashem took away the holy spirit from non-Jews, for this one was from them and see what he did.",

            "A Halakha: <u>Is one who is pursued by non-Jews or bandits allowed to transgress the laws of Sabbath?</u> Our Rabbis taught: One who is pursued by non-Jews or bandits is permitted to transgress the laws of Sabbath, in order to save his life. Thus we also find with David: When Saul attempted to kill him, he fled and escaped. Our Rabbis said: It once happened that they came to the [Jewish] leadership in Sepphoris with harsh orders from the [Roman] government. They went and said to R. Elazar b. Parta: O Rabbi! We have received harsh orders from the government. What do you say we should do, should we flee? He feared telling them to flee explicitly, so he hinted to them: \"Why are you asking me? Go and ask Yaakov, Moshe, and David\". What does it say about Yaakov? (Hosea 12): \"And Jacob fled.\" Also about Moshe, (Exodus 2): \"Moshe fled.\" And also about David, (I Samuel 19): \"David fled and escaped.\" It also says (Isaiah 26): \"Go my people, enter your rooms.\" The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Such great ones were fearful and fled from those who hated them, yet for those forty years that you were in the desert, I did not let them flee. Instead I felled all their haters before them, in that I myself that was with them. Not only that, but there were all kinds of snakes, serafim, and scorpions there: (Deuteronomy 8): \"Snakes, sefarim, and scorpions\", yet I did not allow them to hurt you. Therefore The Holy One Blessed Be He said to Moshe: Record the journeys that Israel undertook in the desert, it order that they should know what kind of miracles I performed from them. How [will they know]? From all that they read regarding \"These are the journeys\"."
