Bibi's name: The Sodomites made an agreement among themselves that whenever a stranger visited them they should force him to sodomy and rob him of his money; even him of whom it is written, “That they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice” (Gen. xvm, 19), we would use him bestially and rob him of his money.
