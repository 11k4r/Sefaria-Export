            "R’ Abahu and R’ Chiya Raba. R’ Abahu said - from the beginning of the creation of the world the Holy One saw the actions of the righteous and the actions of the wicked. This is what is written “For the Lord knows the way of the righteous…” (Tehillim 1:6) “Now the earth was astonishingly empty…” (Bereshit 1:2) these are the actions of the wicked, “And God said, Let there be light…” (Bereshit 1:3) these are the actions of the righteous. But I don’t know which one of them He desired, the actions of these or the actions of those. Since it is written “And God saw the light that it was good…” (Bereshit 1:4). He desires the actions of the rieghteous and not the actions of the wicked. R’ Chiya Raba said – from the beginning of the creation of the world the Holy Oe saw the Holy Temple built, destroyed and built. “In the beginning of God's creation…” (Bereshit 1:1) refers to it built, this is what it says “…to plant the heavens and to found the earth…” (Yeshayahu 51:16) “Now the earth was astonishingly empty…” refers to it destroyed, this is what it says “I saw the earth, and behold, it was void and unformed…” (Yirmiyahu 4:23) , “And God said, Let there be light…” refers to it built and complete in the future to come, this is what it says “Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has shone upon you. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and a gross darkness the kingdoms, and the Lord shall shine upon you, and His glory shall appear over you.” (Yeshayahu 60:1-2) "

            "The way of the world is that one pours a full vessel into an empty one. Perhaps you can pour a full vessel into a full vessel?! All the world was water in water and you say “…into one place…” (Genesis 1:9) Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot. Similarly - “Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation in front of the rock…” (Numbers 20:10) R’ Chanina said: there was a space the size of the mouth of a small sieve there, and all of Israel stood there? Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot. Similarly – “The Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, \"Take yourselves handfuls (chofneichem) of furnace soot…” (Exodus 9:8) R’ Huna said: and could Moshe’s handful hold eight handfuls (kamatzim)? That’s strange! Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot. There is no comparison between what one takes in a cupped handful (chofan) and what one takes in a closed handful (kamatz). A cupped handful is twice that of a closed and it is written “…and Moses shall cast it heavenward…” (ibid.) therefore Moshe’s cupped hand held eight closed handfuls. Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot.  Similarly – R’ Yosi bar Chalifta said: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits and the width fifty by fifty cubits,” (Exodus 27:18) and all of Israel stood there? That’s strange! Rather from here we learn that a little can hold a lot. Similarly - “And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here…” (Joshua 3:9) R’ Huna said: he stood them all up between the two poles of the ark. R’ Acha bar R’ Chanina said: he placed them between the two poles of the ark. The Rabbis said: he shrank them between the two poles of the ark. Yehoshua said to them: from the fact that the two poles of the ark could hold you, you know that Presence of the Holy One is among you. This is what is written “By this you shall know that the living God is in your midst…” (Joshua 3:10) So too regarding Jerusalem it is taught ‘they stood crowded together, but prostrated themselves with plenty of space between them. R’ Shmuel bar R’ Chana said in the name of R’ Acha: each one had four cubits, and a cubit of space to each side so that no one heard the prayer of his fellow. So too it will be in the time to come, as it says “At that time, they will call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord…” (Jeremiah 3:17) R’ Yochanan went up to visit R’ Chanina, he found him sitting and interpreting this verse ‘At that time, they will call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord.’ He said to him: oh my teacher, can Jerusalem really hold the throne of the Lord? He replied: The Holy One said to her ‘spread out your length and breadth and receive your population.’ This is what is written “Widen the place of your tent…” (Isaiah 54:2) Why? “For right and left shall you prevail…” (Isaiah 54:3)"

            "“And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden from the east…” (Bereshit 2:8) They said in the house of R’ Yannai ‘why does the verse use the full name of Gd in reference to planting the garden? Because from the beginning of its creation it required proper alignment. Before man is given form in the womb of his mother, he must align himself with her directions. This is what is written “The Lord's trees are sated, the cedars of Lebanon, which He planted.”’ (Tehillim 104:16) R’ Chanina said ‘They were like the horns of grasshoppers, and the Holy One uprooted them and transplanted into the garden, ‘The Lord's trees are sated…’ R’ Chanina said – they lives were sated, their waters sated, their grove sated.’ R’ Yochanan said ‘the world was not fit to make us of cedars, because they were created only for the needs of the Holy Temple. This is what is written “The Lord's trees are sated, the cedars of Lebanon…” Lebanon only refers to the Holy Temple, as it says “…this good mountain and the Lebanon.”’ (Devarim 3:25) R’ Shmuel bat Nachman said in the name of R’ Yonatan ‘there are twenty-four types of cedar, and only seven of them are praiseworthy. This is what it says “I will give in the desert cedars…”’ (Yeshayahu 41:19) R’ Acha said ‘three: b’rosh is cypress, tidhar is juniper, ta’ashur is box-wood. And why do they call box-wood ta’ashur? Because it is the happiest (m’ushar) among them.’ They added three more to the count – alonim, armonim, almogim. Alonim are oaks, armonim are plane-trees, almogim are aloe-woods. "

            "“The name of one is Pishon…” (Bereshit 2:11) This is Migdal Pishtan and its waters flow massively. “…that is the one that encompasses all the land of Havilah…” (ibid.) There was not yet a place called Havilah, and it says that the river encompasses it? That is strange! Rather, “tell the end from the beginning…” (Yeshayahu 46:10) “…where there is gold,” (Bereshit 2:11) gold there certainly was. “And the gold of that land is good…” (Bereshit 2:12) R’ Yitzchak said ‘happy is he in whose house it is, happy is he in whose company it is.’ R’ Abahu said ‘the Holy One gave a great good to His world – a man breaks a gold piece into smaller pieces, and he can buy many things with it.’ Resh Lakish said ‘the world was not fit to use gold, why was it created? For the Holy Temple, as it says “And the gold of that land is good…” like that which it says “…this good mountain and the Lebanon.” (Devarim 3:25) “…there is the crystal and the onyx stone.” (Bereshit 2:12) R’ Ibo said ‘you think this is referring to the crystal of apothecaries? Let another verse clarify it for you “…and its appearance was like the appearance of crystal.” (Bamidbar 11:7) Just as this refers to a precious stone, so too that refers to a precious stone.’"

            "“And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field…” (Genesis 4:8) What were they arguing over? They said, come let us divide the world – one will take the land and the other will take the moveable property. This one said: the ground which you are standing on is mine! The other said: the clothes you are wearing are mine! This one said: strip! The other one said: float! As a result “…Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.” (ibid.) R’ Yehoshua of Sachnin said in the name of R’ Levi: they both took the land and the moveable property. Then what was their argument about? One said: the Holy Temple will be built in my portion! The other said: the Holy Temple will be built in my portion! As it says ‘and it came to pass while they were in the field’ and the field refers to the Holy Temple as it says “Zion shall be plowed as a field” (Micah 3:12) As a result “…Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.” Yehudah bar Ami said: they were arguing about the first woman. R’ Ibo said: the first woman had returned to the dust, so what were they arguing about? R’ Huna said: Hevel was born with a twin sister. This one said: I will take her because I am the first born! This one said: I will take her because she was born with me! As a result “Cain rose up…”"

If it is distress there is no distress like it and if it is joy there is no joy like it. R’ Shmuel ben Nachmani came and split the teaching in half. Anywhere that it says ‘and it was’ (vayehi) indicates distress, ‘and it will be’ (v’haya) indicates joy…The brought a challenge from this verse “…and he was [there] (v’haya) when Jerusalem was taken.” (Jeremiah 38:28) He said to them: this is still a cause of joy because on that very day Israel received full payment for their sins. As R’ Shmuel ben Nachmani said: Israel received full payment for their sins on the day the Holy Temple was destroyed, as it says “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion…” (Lamentations 4:22)"

Jerusalem is called righteousness as it says, “…in which righteousness would lodge…” (Isaiah 1:21) ‘king of Shalem’ R’ Yitzchak the Bavli says (he is called this) because he was born circumcised. ‘brought out bread and wine, and he was a priest to the Most High God’ R’ Shmuel bar Nachmani and the Rabbanan argues, R’ Shmuel said that the laws if the High Priesthood were revealed to him – ‘bread’ is the show bread, ‘wine’ are the libations. The Rabbanan say that Torah was revealed to him as it says, “\"Come, partake of my bread and drink of the wine I have mingled.” (Mishle 9:5) ‘and he was a priest to the Most High God’ R’ Aba bar Kahana said every mention of wine written in the Torah makes an impact except for this, R’ Levi said that even this we did not escape, because from there He called upon him “…and they will enslave them and oppress them, for four hundred years.” (Bereshit 15:13)"

At the moment when You said to me ‘take your son, your only one’ I had a response for You. Yesterday You said to me “for in Isaac will be called your seed” (Bereshit 21:12) and now to take my son? But, heaven forfend I did not do so, rather I overcame my mercy in order to do Your will. May it be Your will oh Lord our Gd that in the moment when the children of Yitzchak sin and do wrong that You recall for their sakes this binding and be filled with mercy toward them. Avraham called it yireh, as it says ““And Abraham named that place, The Lord will see (yireh) …” Shem called it Shalem, as it says “And Malchizedek the king of Shalem…” (Bereshit 14:18) The Holy One said, if I call it yireh as Avraham called  it, Shem the righteous man will be angered. If I call it shalem, Avraham the righteous man will be angered. Rather, I will call it Yerushalayim, as they both called it – yireh-shalem Yerushalayim. R’ Berachia said in the name of R’ Chelbo before it was Shalem, the Holy One made there a sukkah and prayed in it as it says “His Tabernacle was in Salem, and His dwelling place in Zion.” (Tehillim 76:3) What would He say? ‘May it be willed that I see the building of My house.’ Another explanation: this teaches that the Holy One showed him the Temple destroyed and built, destroyed and built, as it says “And Abraham named that place, The Lord will see…” that means built as it says “Three times in the year, every one of your males shall appear (yireh) before the Lord…” (Devarim 16:16)  “…as it is said to this day: On the mountain...” (Bereshit 22:14) that means destroyed, as it says “For Mount Zion, which has become desolate…” (Eicha 5:18) “…the Lord will be seen.” (Bereshit 22:14) built and perfected for the time to come, as it says “For the Lord has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory.” (Tehillim 102:17)"

This one said ‘the Torah will be given on me!’ and this one said ‘the Torah will be given on me!’ Mount Tabor came from Bet Elim and  Mount Carmel from Espamia, this is what is written “As long as I live, says the King, Whose name is the Lord of Hosts, that as sure as Tabor is among the mountains, and Carmel is by the sea, it shall come about.” (Yimiyahu 46:18) This one said ‘I was called!’ and this one said ‘I was called!’ The Holy One said ‘Why do you lurk, you lofty mountains?’ You are all high mountains, but what does lofty (gavnunim) mean? As it says “…or one with long eyebrows (gibein), or a cataract…” (Vayikra 21:20) Idolatry was done on all of you, but Sinai upon which idolatry was never done “…the mountain that God desired for His dwelling,” (Tehillim 68:17) “The Lord descended upon Mount Sinai…” (Shemot 19:20) Nevertheless, “…Even the Lord will dwell [there] forever,” (Tehillim 68:17) refers to the eternal House. R’ Akiva explained the verse as referring to the tribes. At the moment when Shlomo said to build the Holy Temple, the tribes came running and arguing with each other. This one said ‘in my portion it will be built!’ This one said ‘in my portion it will be built!’ The Holy One said to them ‘tribes, why are you lurking? All of you are tribes, all of you are righteous – but lofty (gavnunim). What is gavnunim? Ganavim (thieves). You were all partners in the sale of Yosef; but Benyamin, who did not participate in the sale of Yosef, “…he mountain that God desired for His dwelling.” (Tehillim 68:17) So we find that four hundred and eighty years before hand the children of Koarch prophesied on this, that in the future it would be in the portion of Benyamin as it says “My soul yearns, yea, it pines for the courts of the Lord…” (Tehillim 84:3) So too it says “Behold we heard it in Ephrath…” (Tehillim 132:6) R’ Yehudah says ‘the Holy Temple was built in the portion of Yehudah, as it is written “…Ephrathite man from Bethlehem of Judah…”’ (Shmuel I 17:12) R’ Shimon says ‘in the portion of the son of she who died in Ephrathah. And who died in Ephrathah? Rachel. Perhaps it was in the portion of Yosef who is also among her sons? The verse says “…we found it in the fields of the forest.” (Tehillim 132:6) In the portion of the one who is compared to a beast of the forest, and who is so compared? Benyamin, as it is written “Benjamin is a wolf, he will prey…” (Bereshit 49:27)"

            "“… and he made for his father a mourning of seven days.” (Bereshit 50:10) Why do we mourn for seven days in parallel to the seven days of feasting? The Holy One said to them: in this world you shared the pain of this righteous one and mourned for him seven days, in the coming world I will transform that mourning to joy, as it says “…and I will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow.” (Yirmiyahu 31:12) And just as I console you, so I will console Zion and all her waste places in the manner that it says,” For the Lord shall console Zion, He shall console all its ruins, and He shall make its desert like a paradise and its wasteland like the garden of the Lord; joy and happiness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and a voice of song.” (Yeshayahu 51:3)\n"
