                "It was in the days [of Aḥashveirosh, he was Aḥashveirosh]: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said, \"Because he darkened the faces of Israel like the sides of a pot.\" Rabbi B'rekhya said, \"Because he withered the head of Israel with fasting and affliction.\" Rabbi Levi said, \"Because he made them drink gall and wormwood.\" Rabbi Yuda son of Rabbi Simon said, \"Because he tried to destroy the roots of Israel\". Rabbi Taḥlifa son of Bar Ḥana said, \"Because he was the brother of a leader, the brother of Nevukhadnetzar.\" Could he have been his brother? Wasn't one a Chaldean and another a Median? But one suspended work on the Temple and the other destroyed it, so Scripture considers them equivalent. So is it said, \"Also one one lazy in his work is a brother to the destroyer.\" (Proverbs 18:9) \"Also one lazy in his work\" - this is Aḥashveirosh who suspended work on the Temple. \"A brother to the destroyer\" - this is Nevukhadnetzar who destroyed the Temple. Another interpretation: Of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemia one said \"Aḥashveirosh\" - that he killed his wife because of his friend, \"He was Aḥashveirosh\" - that he killed his friend because of his wife. Rabbi Neḥemia said, \"Aḥashveirosh\" - that he suspended work on the Temple, \"He was Aḥashveirosh\" - that decreed it be rebuilt. Did he decree that it be rebuilt? Didn't Koresh decree that? It is written, \"In the first year of King Koresh.\" (Ezra 6:3) At that time all his counselors came to him and said, \"Your father decreed that it not be rebuilt and you decree that it be rebuilt?! Can a king cancel the decrees of a king?\" He said to them, \"Bring me copies of the decrees\". They brought them to him at once, as it is said \"It was found in Aḥm'ta in the capitol\" (Ezra 6:2). What was written in it? \"Therefore make a decree to stop\" (Ezra 4:21) He said to them, \"Does it say forever? It only said 'until a decree is made by me.' Who can tell me that if my father were alive he would not have built it?\" That is why he is included among the prophets, as it is said, \"The elders of the Jews built and prospered etc.\" (Ezra 6:14)", 
                "\"He was\" - five for evil and five for good. Five for evil: \"He was a mighty warrior\" (Genesis 10:9) \"He was Eisav the father of Edom\" (Genesis 36:43) \"They were Datan and Aviram\" (Numbers 26:9) \"He was King Aḥaz\" (Chronicles II 28:22) \"He was Aḥashveirosh\" (Esther 1:1). Five for good: \"Avram was Avraham\" (Chronicles I 1:27) \"They were Moshe and Aharon\" (Exodus 6:26) \"They were Aharon and Moshe\" (Exodus 6:27) \"David was the youngest\" (Samuel I 17:14) \"He was Ḥizkiyahu\" (Chronicles II 32:12) \"He, Ezra, went up from Bavel\" (Ezra 7:6). Rabbi B'rekhya said in the name of the Rabbis over there \"We have one that is better than them all 'He is Hashem our G-d, his judgments are in the whole world' (Psalms 105:7 because His quality of mercy is eternal.\"", 
                "\"Aḥashveirosh\" Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis: Rabbi Levi said, \"Aḥashveirosh was Artaḥshasta\" and the Rabbis say \"Aḥashveirosh - because anyone who remembers him has a ache (ḥoshesh) in his head (rosho).\" Why did Scripture call him \"Artaḥshasta\"? Because he would rage (rataḥ) and then calm (tash). \"Aḥashveirosh\": Rabbi Yitzhak and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yitzhak said, \"Aḥashveirosh - that all the troubles came in his time, as it is said 'A great mourning for the Jews' (Esther 4:3). He was Aḥashveirosh - that all the good things came in his time, as it is said 'Esther'.\" The Rabbis say 'Aḥashveirosh' - until Esther came to him. 'He was Aḥashveirosh' - once Esther came to him he would not lie with menstruating women.\"", 
                "\"Who ruled\" and had not ruled before. \"From India to Kush\" Isn't from India to Kush a small thing? But just as he ruled from India to Kush so he ruled over one hundred and twenty seven provinces. Similarly, \"For he ruled over all the side of the River, from Tifsaḥ to `Aza.\" (Kings I 5:1) Isn't from Tifsaḥ to `Aza a small thing? But just as he controlled from Tifsaḥ to `Aza so he controlled from one end of the world to the other. Similarly, \"From your temple on Yerushalayim, there will kings lead tribute to you\" (Psalms 68:29). Isn't from the Temple to Yerushalayim a small thing? But just as the sacrifices are to be found from the Temple to Yerushalayim so lines of people with gifts will be found for the anointed king. So is it said, \"All kings will prostrate themselves before him\" (Psalms 72:11). Rabbi Kohen brother of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, \"Just as the Divine Presence is found from the Temple to Yerushalayim so will the Divine Presence will the world from one end to another.\" So it is said, \"His glory will fill the world. Amen and amen.\" (Psalms 72:19)", 
                "\"Seven and twenty and one hundred.\"  Rabbi Elazar in the name of Rabbi Hanina: And are there not only two-hundred fifty two provinces in the world, and David ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"And the name of David went out in all of the lands\" (Chronicles I 14:17).  Solomon ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"And Solomon ruled over all of the kingdoms...\" (Kings I 5:1).  Ahav ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"As the Lord God lives, there is no nation or kingdom...\" (Kings I 18:1).  And does a person swear regarding a place that he does not rule?  Further, \"And he counted the youth of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred thirty two\" (Kings I 20:15).  And where were the rest?  Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis; Rabbi Levi said: all were in famine during the time of Elijah.  The Rabbis say: the son of Hadad came and took them, as it is written: \"And the son of Hadad, the king of Aram, gathered all his armies and thirty two kings with him, and horses and chariots, and he rose up and besieged Shomron and waged war with her\" (Kings I 20:1).  We need twenty, and you say thirty two?  Rather, there was a troublesome province, and two provinces were created from it and he made them connected under his hand.  Rabbi Berechia and the Rabbis; Rabbi Berechia said: the children of his pressure [referring to Lamentations 3:13] and his hostages.  The Rabbis said: 'the children of his pressure,' since they were tortured; and 'his hostages,' since they were the hostages of their fathers, and so it is said: \"And the hostages as well\" (Kings II 14:14) that they were the hostages used in exchange for their fathers.  Nebuchadnezzar ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"And wherever the children of men, the animals of the field, and the birds of the skies...\" (Daniel 2:38).  Koresh ruled over all of them, as it is written: \"All of the kingdoms God gave me\" (Ezra 1:2).  Darius ruled over all of them, as it is written: The King Darius wrote to all the peoples...\" (Daniel 6:26).  Aḥashveirosh ruled over half of them.  Why half?  Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Acha and the Rabbis; Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Acha said: God said to him: you divided my kingdom, as you said \"he is the Lord in Jerusalem\" (Ezra 1:3), know that I will surely divide your kingdom.  The Rabbis said: God said to him: you divided the building that was my house, as you said \"It's height was sixty cubits, and sixty cubits wide\" (Ezra 6:3), know that I will surely divide your kingdom.  And let it say one hundred twenty six, what is it teaching us [by saying one hundred twenty seven]?  Rather, so said God to him: you put one of your own to my house, as you said: \"Whoever from among you has his God with him, let him go up\" (Ezra 1:3).  So too I will add one from mine, as God added one in the calculation, thus it says \"Seven and twenty and one hundred provinces.\"",

Every time it says \"city\" it refers to a state. Every time it says \"state\" - it refers to a province. How do we know that \"field\" refers to a city? For it is stated: (1 Kings 2:26) \"Anatoth, your own cities.\" \"City\" - that it refers to state?

This is to make them emulate their Creator as it says [about God] and My name, Jehovah, I did not make known to them. \"Jewish\" -- Why was he called 'Judean' if he was of Benjamin? Because he attested to the unity of God in the world as it says \"[and Mordechai] would not kneel and would not bow] (therefore he was called a part of Judah which means 'to acknowledge God'). And [why] was he a contrarian that ignored the king's decree? Because when Ahasuerus  decreed that everyone should bow to Haman, Haman started wearing an idol so that everyone would bow to the idol, and when he saw that Mordechai refused to bow he became very angry. Mordechai told him \"there is a Lord who is above all the arrogant. How can I forsake him and bow to an idol?\" Thus, because he attested to God's unity, he was called The Jew i.e. the only Jew.  There are those who also compare him to Abraham. Just as Abraham threw himself into the furnace, came out alive, and caused people to recognize God -- this being what is referred to by the verse \"and the souls they made in Haran\" -- Mordechai also helped pepole recognize God in his own day as it says \"And many people of the land converted to Judaism.\" [In conclusion] he attested to the unity of God and His holiness and was therefore called \"the Jew\".",

That is [the meaning of] that which is written, \"Mordechai passed and did like everything that Esther commanded him.\" There they say, that he passed  the holiday of Pesach  in  a fast.

As I was fearful in front of You to give Your honor to flesh and blood, and I did not want to bow down to anyone besides You. As who am I not to bow down to Haman for the salvation of Your people, Israel? For Your sake, I would have licked the shoes of his feet.

He gathered the children, and afflicted them from [receiving] bread and water and clothed them with sackcloth and sat them in the dust, and they were calling out and crying and involved in Torah [study]. And at that time, Esther was very scared because of the evil that had grown in Israel and she took off the clothing of her royalty and splendor and wore sackcloth, and she uncovered the hair of her head and covered it with dust and ashes, and she afflicted herself with fasting. And she fell on her face in front of the Lord and prayed and said, \"Lord, God of Israel, who has ruled from the days of yore and created the world, please help Your maidservant, as I was orphaned without father or mother and am comparable to a poor woman who goes to beg from house to house; so do I beg Your mercy, from window to window in the house of Achasverosh.

Does it not already say (Psalms 121:4) \"Behold, he does not slumber, nor sleep, He guards Israel\"?

He said to his scribe: Bring me the book of chronicles, to read and to see what happened to him. And the scribes began, and they found the matter of Mordechai informing about Bigtan and Teresh.

They delved into the laws of the commandment of the Omer, for that day was the 16th of Nissan, and on that day they would have been offering the Omer when the Holy Temple was still there. Haman came to them. He said to them, \"What are you dealing with?\" They said to him, \"The commandment of the Omer. That's what is written: [Leviticus 2:1] 'And when you bring a grain offering to God...'

Is there anyone who dresses in the royal clothes without getting washed [first]?\" [Haman] went and sought a bathkeeper, but he could not find. What did he do?

I don't know the father of that man [if he was] a bathkeeper and a barber in Kfar Krainos, but you indeed found his scissors!\" [Haman] said to him, \"Get up! Ride upon these horses!\" [Mordechai] said to him, \"I don't have the strength. I'm old!\" He said to him, \"And I'm not an old man?\" He said to him, \"Didn't you do this to yourself [i.e. this is your fault]?\" He said to him, \"Get up, I'll lean my neck, and you can step on top of it, and you will go up and ride, to fulfill for you that which is written, (Deuteronomy 33:29), 'You shall tread on their high places.'\"",

When they saw that the things were like this, they cried out. (2) \"And it was in the days of Achaz the son of Yoshiah, King of Yehudah\" (Isaiah 7:1). What grief was there over there? \"It is what is stated by the verse (Isaiah 9:11), \"Aram is in front and the Philistines are behind, etc.\" [It is comparable] to a king that gave his son over to a mentor, and the mentor hated him. He said, \"If I kill him, I will become liable for death. Rather, I will take away his nourishment from him and he will die on his own\": So did the evil Achaz say, \"If there are no goats, there will be no rams; if there is no flock, there will be no shepherd, [and] where will the world be?\" So did he say, \"If there are no masters, there will be no students; if there are no students, there will be no sages; if there is no Torah, there will be no synagogues and study halls.\" What did he do? He passed all the synagogues and study halls and sealed them. And this [is the meaning of] that which the verse states (Isaiah 8:16), \"Bind up the message; seal the instruction with My disciples.\" And when they saw that the things were like this, they all started to cried out, \"Woe that the world is being destroyed\" - when [study of] the Torah was negated, that was in the days of Achaz. (3) \"And it was in the days of Yehoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu\" (Jeremiah 1:3). What grief was there over there? \"I looked at the earth, and behold it was empty and void; at the heavens and their light was not\" (Jeremiah 4:23), [It is comparable] to edicts of the kings that were brought to the provinces of the kingdom. In each and every province, when it came to their hands, everyone would stand on their feet, uncover their heads and read them with fear, trembling and perspiration. But when they were brought to the province of the king, they tore them up and burned them: When the Holy One, blessed be He, sends His messenger to the nations of the world, they repent, cover themselves in sackcloth and fast - as did the people of Nineveh, as it is stated (Jonah 3:7), \"from the order of the king and his principals, etc.\" They, may their memory be blessed, said, \"One who had a beam or a stone that was stolen in his house would destroy the house and remove it and return the theft.\" And because of this did Yonah fear to prophesy to Nineveh. As Rabbi Tarfon said, \"The fish was designated, etc.\" And the nations of the world are afraid in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, and [so, they are] close to repentance, whereas Israel is stiff-necked. This is what the verse stated (Jeremiah 36:23), \"And it was when Yehudi would read three columns or four\" - meaning to say, he read four verses - and in the fifth verse, he read, \"And her tormentors became the head\" (Lamentations 1:5) - and it is is written (Jeremiah 36:23), \"he would tear it with a scribe's blade and throw it into the fire until the end of all of the scroll.\" And when they saw this, everyone began to cry out, \"Woe for the decree that is hanging over us.\" And the other (4) - \"And it was in the days of Achashverosh\" (Esther 1:1). What grief was there over there? [It is comparable] to a king that had a vineyard, and he had three enemies. What did they do? One cut the small berries, the second ripped the clusters and the third uprooted the vines: The king is King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He; His vineyard is Israel, as it is stated (Isaiah 5:7), \"For a vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel\"; [And] their three enemies are Pharaoh, Nevukhadnetsar and Haman. Pharaoh began with the small berries, as it is stated (Exodus 1:22), \"Any son that is born, throw him into the river.\" Nevukhadnetsar ripped the clusters, as it is stated (Jeremiah 29:2), \"the craftsmen and the smiths.\" Who are the craftsmen (<i>charash</i>)? These are the ones that pray the mute prayer silently, and are victorious with their prayer over all the nations of the world. The smiths?  That all the nations of the world come in a vice in front of them but [then] flee, as they put a vice on all the nations - and Nevukhadnetsar come to destroy them; and he destroyed the craftsmen and the smiths, and exiled them. The evil Haman [then] came [to] uproot the vines, as it is stated (Esther 3:13), \"to annihilate, to kill and to destroy.\" Everyone began to cry out, \"Woe,\" and they mourned in front of the Omnipresent. (5) \"And it was in the days when the judges ruled\" (Ruth 1:1) - there was famine there; and what grief is greater than famine? And from where [do we know] that there was famine? As it is stated (Ruth 1:1), \"and there was a famine in the land.\" And why was there a famine? Because Israel and the judges were not judging true judgement; as it is is stated, \"And it was in the days when the judges ruled\" - [and] we find [following it], \"he\", which indicates evildoers. [As] so do we find, \"he was Datan and Aviram\" (Numbers 26:9); \"he was Achashverosh\" (Esther 1:1); \"he was [...] Achaz\" (II Chronicles 28:22). So too were the judges. And to what is the matter comparable? To a province that was liable a tax to the king. [So] he sent collectors to collect it. The people of the province rose and smote the collectors and hung them. The judgment that they were liable - as they appointed other judges for themselves - they did to the collectors. So did they do at that time, as Elimelekh would judge the judges; [since] he was a strongman and there were many men below him. He saw the distress and the famine, but he did not warn the sinners to repent from their evil. And he stopped living in Beit Lechem for himself to live in the field of Moav - to sustain his soul during the famine, and the soul of his wife during the famine, and the soul of his sons; and he did not know that [it is] the Torah that sustains its masters and not the vanities of the world. And he was one who was important, as it is stated (Ruth 1:1), \"and a man went from Beit Lechem, Yehudah.\" And we only say, \"man,\" about an important man, as it is stated (Numbers 12:3), \"And the man, Moshe, was very humble.\" As Elimelekh was an important man, as they would consider him [so] in his place - and [yet] he went to save his soul and the soul of his household, and did not trouble himself about the matters of the community; even as he was an important man and they would have believed his words, [such as] to make them repent from their evil and bring them to repentance. And therefore, it occurred to him as it is written in the verse (Ruth 1:3), \"And Elimelekh, the husband of Naomi died.\" And so [too,] his sons died, as it is stated (Ruth 1:5), \"And [...his] two [sons,] Machlon and Khilyon died, and the woman survived her two children and her husband.\" As so were they judging their judges, like Sodom. Rabbi Shimon ben Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, \"Any place that it is stated, 'and it was (<i>vayehi</i>),' it is used for grief and it is used for joy. And when for grief, there is no grief like it, and when for joy, there is no joy like it.\" (The text is missing the following integral part of the midrash, found in Bereishit Rabbah 42:3 and other places: Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman came and divided it, \"Any place that it is stated 'it will be,' it is used for joy; [but] 'and it was' [is for] grief.\") The Sages responded, \"Behold 'And God said, \"<i>Vayehi</i> (here used as a command form, and not past tense) light\"' [is] joy!\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. As so did Rabbi Yehudah bar Simon say, '[Regarding] the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam [could] look and observe from [one] end of the world to the [other] end. [But] since the Holy One, blessed be He, saw the deeds of the generation of Enosh and the generation of the flood, He arose and hid it from them. That is [the meaning of] what the verse states (Job 38:15), \"From the wicked is their light withheld.\" And to where is it hidden? [It is] in the Garden of Eden, for the righteous ones, as it is stated (Psalms 97:11), \"Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the straight-hearted.\"'\" They responded to him further, \"It states, 'And it was evening and it was morning, one day.'\" He said to them, \"On that day too, it is not of joy, as all the acts of the first day are destined to wither, as it is stated (Isaiah 51:6), 'when the heavens melt away like smoke and the earth wither like a garment.'\" They responded to him, \"Behold, the [acts of] the second day, the third day, the fourth day, the fifth day, the sixth day.\" He said to them, \"They too are not of joy, as all the acts of the six days of creation require further action - for example, wheat needs to be ground; mustard needs to be mellowed; lupine need to be mellowed.\" They responded to him, \"[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yosef and he was a successful man' (Genesis 39:7)?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as that 'bear' chanced upon him from this, as it is stated in the verse, 'after' - 'And it was after these things, and the wife of his master raised, etc.' (Genesis 39:7).\" They responded to him, \"[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yehoshua, and his reputation was in all the land' (Joshua 6:27)?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin, fell at that time; as it is stated (Joshua 7:5), 'And the men of Ai smote of them, like thirty-six men' - and the master said, 'That is Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin.'\" They responded to him, \"And is it not written (I Samuel 18:14), 'And it was that David was successful in all of his ways and the Lord was with him'?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as enmity descended into the heart of Shaul from this, as it is stated (I Samuel 18:9), 'And it was that Shaul eyed David.'\" They responded to him, \"And is it not written (II Samuel 7:1), 'And it was when the king sat in his house and the Lord allowed him rest from all of his enemies'?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as on that same day, Natan the prophet came to David and said to him, 'However you will not build the House' (I Kings 8:19).\" They said to him, \"Behold, we have said what is ours; [now] say what is yours - that 'and it will be' is joy.\" He said to them, \"'And it will be on that day that the mountains will drip with nectar' (Joel 4:18), that will be in the days of the messiah, and there will be great joy for Israel. And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that a man shall save alive a heifer of the herd and two sheep' (Isaiah 7:21). And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that living waters will come out from Jerusalem' (Zechariah 14:8). And so [too,] 'And he will be like a tree planted over streams of water' (Psalms 1:3). And so [too,] 'And the remnant of Yaakov will be among many nations' (Micah 5:6).\" They said to him, \"But behold, it is written (Jeremiah 38:28), '<i>vahaya</i> (here used in the past tense, and not like the other examples) when Jerusalem was captured'!\" He said to them, \"It too is not of grief, as on that day was the verdict of Israel for their sins taken; as so is it written (Lamentations 4:22), 'Your sin has been completed, Daughter of Zion, He will not again exile you.'\""
