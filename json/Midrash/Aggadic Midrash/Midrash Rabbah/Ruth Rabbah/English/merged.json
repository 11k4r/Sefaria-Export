                "\"In the days the judges judged\" (which could also be \"the judges were judged\"). Woe to a generation that judges its judges and Woe to a generation whose judges need to be judged. As it says in Judges 2 \"and they didn't listen to their judges\". Who were those judges? Rav said: \"They were Barak and Deborah\". Rabbis Yehoshua Ben Levy said: \"They were Shamgar and Ehud\". Rav Hunt said: \"They were Deborah, Barak, and Yael. 'Judge' means one, 'judges' two, and 'the judges' three\".", 
                "Rebbe asked Rabbi Betzlel: \"Why does it say (Hosea 2) 'your mother prostitutes herself'? Is it possible Sarah the matriarch did so? He told him: \"Heavens forbid! It means that the words of Torah are disrespected by the simpletons when their own expounded disrespect them. I heard from Rabbis Yaakov bar Advising and Ovadia: 'words of Torah are treated as prostitutes by the simpletons when their expounded disrespect them'\". Rabbi Yochanan added: \"How do we know this? From here (Ecclesiasiastes 9): 'The poor man's wisdom is not respected'. Was the wisdom of poor Rabbi Akiva disrespected? No, \"poor\" means somebody who disrespecto his own words. Such as an elder sitting and teaching (Deuteronomy 19) 'be fair in judgement', and he isn't fair in judgement; 'ignore your relationship with the litigants', and he does not ignore his relationship; 'take no bribes', and he takes bribes. 'Do not oppress the widow and orphan' (Deuteronomy 22) and he does oppress them. Samson went after his eyes, as it says (Judges 14): 'Give her to me for she seems good to me'. Gideon worshipped stars as it says  (Judges 8): 'And he made it into an ephod'. There is no worse poverty. Woe to the judge who is not fair.\"...",

[with an early death, as stated in verse 3: Elimelech, Naomi’s husband died and she was left with her two sons.] Because he struck [despair] into the hearts of Israel, for nothing did he rule the country, and the countrymen were sure that when the years of plague/famine would come, he would be able to sustain the country for 10 years with food! ....Elimelech was one the great leaders of his district and one of the financial supporters of his generation. But when the years of famine came, he said, “Now all Israel will come knocking at my door, each one with his basket.” He got up and fled from them.
