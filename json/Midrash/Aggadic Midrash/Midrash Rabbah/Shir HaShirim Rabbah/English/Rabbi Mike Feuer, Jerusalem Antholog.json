                "R’ Yodan said: before Hezekiah and his supporters had eaten their Passover sacrifice in Jerusalem, the Holy One had already preceded them on that night, as it says “And it came to pass on that night that an angel of the Lord went out and slew one hundred eighty-five thousand of the camp of Assyria…” (Kings II 19:35)\n"

                "“Sustain me with flagons of wine (ashishot)” (Shir HaShirim 2:5) with two fires (aishot) – with the fire above and thefire below. Another explanation: ‘sustain me with flagons of wine,’ with two fires – the written Torah and the Oral Torah. Another explanation: ‘sustain me with flagons of wine,’ with many fires – with the fire of Avraham, and Moriah and the burning bush, and the fire of Eliyahu and that of Chananya, Mishael and Azaria…"

                "“…your nose is as the tower of Lebanon…” (Shir HaShirim 7:5) This refers to the Holy Temple. Just as the nose is placed at the highpoint of a person, so too the Holy Temple is placed at the highpoint of the world. Just as the majority of decorations are hung from the nose, so to the priests, levites and kings are from Yaakov. ‘as the tower of Lebanon.’ As it says “…this good mountain and the Lebanon.” (Devarim 3:25) R’ Teviyumi said ‘it bleaches out (malbin) the sins of Israel like snow, as it says “…If your sins prove to be like crimson, they will become white as snow…” (Yeshayahu 1:18) R’ Shimon bar Yochai says ‘because all hearts (levavot) rejoice in it, as it says “The fairest of branches, the joy of the entire earth- Mount Zion…” (Tehillim 48:3) The Rabbis say ‘because “…and My eyes and My heart (libi) shall be there at all times.” (Melachim I 9:3) “…facing towards Damascus.” (Shir HaShirim 7:5) R’ Yochanan said ‘in the future, Jerusalem will spread out until it reaches the gates of Damascus, as it says “The prophecy of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach.”’ (Zechariah 9:1) What is Hadrach? This is an argument between R’ Yehudah and R’ Nechemia. R’ Yehudah says ‘it is a place called Hadrach.’ R’ Yosi ben Dormaskit said to him ‘by the Temple service! I am from Damascus and there is a place there called Hadrach!’’ R’ Nechemia said ‘this refers to the King Messiah who is severe (chad) and soft (rach). Severe to the nations and soft with Israel.’ Another explanation. Hadrach refers to the King Messiah who in the future will guide (hadrich) all the people of the world in return before the Holy One. \"And Damascus is His resting place…” (ibid.) And is Damascus His resting place?! His resting place is only in the Holy Temple, as it says “This is My resting place forever…” (Tehillim 132:14) He said to him ‘in the future, Jerusalem will spread out on every side until it reaches the gates of Damascus, and the exiles will come and rest beneath her in order to fulfill what it says \"And Damascus is His resting place…” (Zechariah 9:1) How does R’ Yochanan explain the verse “…and the city shall be built on its mound…” (Yirmiyahu 30:18)? Like this fig tree, which is narrow at the bottom and wide above, so Jerusalem will be in the future  - spreading out on all sides with the exiles coming to rest beneath her to fulfill what is written “For right and left shall you prevail…” (Yeshayahu 54:3) This refers to length, from where do we learn width? The scripture says “…from the tower of Hananel until the king's wine-cellars.” (Zechariah 14:10) R’ Zachai Raba said ‘until the pits of Ripa, until the wine vats dug out by the King, king of kings, the Holy One.’ We have the width and breadth, from where do we learn height? “And it became wider and it wound higher and higher to the cells…” (Yechezkel 41:7) It was taught: in the future Jerusalem will spread out and grow upwards until it reaches the Throne of Glory, until she says ‘the place is too narrow for me.’ R’ Yosi son of R’ Yirmiyah said ‘we still have not learned the source of Jerusalem’s praiseworthiness. We learn it from her walls, as it says “But I will be for it-says the Lord-a wall of fire around, and for glory I will be in its midst.” (Zechariah 2:9)\n"

                "... Another explanation. “…for love is as strong as death…” (Song of Songs 8:6) The love with which the generation of persecution loved the Holy One, as it says “For it is for Your sake that we are killed all the time…” (Psalms 44:23) “…zeal is as strong as the grave…” (Song of Songs 8:6) In the future the Holy One will have a great jealousy on behalf of Zion, as it is written “I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy…” (Zechariah 8:2) “…its coals are coals of fire of a great flame!” (Song of Songs 8:2) R’ Berachia said: like the fire above – where the fire does not extinguish the water nor the water extinguish the fire."
