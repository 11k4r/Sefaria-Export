                "... and saw the place from afar – And how did it appear from afar? This teaches that at first it was a depression in the land. Since the Holy One declared his intention to bring His Prsence to rest upon it and to make there the Holy Temple, He said ‘it is not the way of a king to dwell in a valley, but rather in a place which is elevated, superior, beautified and visible to all. Immediately the Holy One hinted to the surroundings of the valley that the mountains should gather together in one place to make a place for the Presence. Therefore it is called Mount Moriah, because from the fear (yirah) of the Holy One it was made a mountain."

                "“And He called to Moshe…” (Vayikra 1:1) From where did He call him?  From the Tent of meeting. Let His name be blessed forever for he left the upper worlds and chose the lower to dwell in the Tabernacle because of His love for Israel. This is what Shlomo said “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You…” (Melachim I 8:27) Does a potter desire clay vessels?! It is comparable, so to speak, because He is the creator of all. However, due to His love “My soul yearns, yea, it pines for the courts…” (Tehillim 84:3) So to it says ‘and He called to Moshe from the Tent of Meeting.’ How great was Moshe! See what is written “And God called the light day…” (Bereshit 1:5) and here ‘He called to Moshe’ – this was a call and that was a call. Who is greater the captor or the captive? I would say the captive. See what is written ‘And God called the light day,’ and light only refers to Torah, as it says “For a commandment is a candle, and the Torah is light…” (Mishle 6:23). Moshe captured the whole Torah, as it says “You ascended on high, you took captives…” (Tehillim 68:19) The Holy One said to Moshe ‘in this world I made you the head over all of Israel and in the coming world when the righteous come to take their reward you will be at the head of them all, asit says “And he came at the head of the people; he did what is righteous for the Lord, and what is lawful with Israel.” (Devarim 33:21)"

                "... at the moment when He said to him “And they shall make Me a sanctuary…” (Shemot 25:8) Moshe replied to the Holy One “Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You…” (Melachim I 8:27) Further, it says “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth? says the Lord.” (Yirmiyahu 23:24) and “The heavens are My throne, and the earth is My footstool…” (Yeshayahu 66:1) and we are able to make Him a Sanctuary? The Holy One said to him ‘I am not asking you to do this according to My power, but according to yours, as it says “And the Mishkan you shall make out of ten curtains…” (Shemot 26:1)’ Once Israel heard this they rose up, donated with a will and made the Tabernacle. And since they made the Tabernacle it was filled with His glory, as it says “Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting…” (Shemot 40:35) The princes declared ‘this is the time to offer sacrifices in joy, because the Divine Presence has come to rest among us.’ From where did they know this? From what they read at the beginning “And it was that on the day that Moses finished…” (Bamidbar 7:1)"

                "“When you come into the land and plant…” This is what is written “And I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind.” (Kohelet 2:5) Doesn’t all humanity plant anything which they desire?! Whatever a man plants in the earth it produces, whether pepper or anything else – if a man plants it, it grows! Rather, people do not know the proper place for each particular plant. But Shlomo, who was wise, planted all manner of trees [as it says “And I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind”]. R’ Yannai said that Shlomo even planted pepper plants, and how did he plant them?! Shlomo was wise and knew the essential foundation (?) of the world. From where “from Tzion the sum of all beauty Gd appears” (Tehillim 50:2), from Tzion which includes within it the whole world. Why is it called the Foundation Stone? Because the whole world was founded from it. Shlomo knew which ligament extended to Kush and planted pepper on it, and it produced immediately, just as he said “and I planted in them trees of every kind.” Another explanation: “and I planted in them fruit trees of every kind…” Just as the navel is placed in the middle of a man, so is the Land of Israel the navel of the world, as it says “those who sit on the center of the land (Ezekiel 38:12). The land of Israel sits in the middle of the world, and Jerusalem in the middle of the land of Israel, and the Temple in the middle of Jerusalem, and the palace in the middle of the Temple, and the ark in the middle of the palace and the Foundation stone before the palace (should this say before the ark – search for other versions!) from which the world was founded. Shlomo, who was wise, understood the roots that went out from it to the whole world and planted on them all types of trees, and therefore he said – I made for myself gardens and orchards."
