                "... R’ Shmuel bar Nachmani said: we have an oral tradition that Jerusalem will not be rebuilt until all of the exiles are ingathered. If someone says to you that the exiles are gathered and Jerusalem is not rebuilt do not believe it, as it says “The Lord is the builder of Jerusalem…” and afterwards it says “He will gather the outcasts of Israel.” (Psalms 147:2) Israel said before the Holy One: Master of the world! Has Jerusalem not already been rebuilt and destroyed? He replied to them: through sins it was destroyed and you were exiled from within her, but now I will build her and I will never destroy her, as it says “For the Lord has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory.” (Psalms 102:17)"

Since the Holy One declared his intention to bring His Prsence to rest upon it and to make there the Holy Temple, He said ‘it is not the way of a king to dwell in a valley, but rather in a place which is elevated, superior, beautified and visible to all. Immediately the Holy One hinted to the surroundings of the valley that the mountains should gather together in one place to make a place for the Presence. Therefore it is called Mount Moriah, because from the fear (yirah) of the Holy One it was made a mountain."

R’ Yitzcha said: now we have no prophet, no priest, no offerings. No Sanctuary, no altar – who will atone for us? Though the Holy Temple is destroyed, all that is left in our hands is prayer. Therefore “O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive…” (Daniel 9:19) Have you not said “…My eyes and My heart shall be there at all times”? (Kings I 9:3) See what is written “Be in pain and kneel, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in confinement, for now you shall go forth from the city; and you shall dwell in the field…” (Micah 4:10) It is written ‘I dwell,’ meaning that even though I exiled you from there my Presence will not move from that place. ‘Field’ here is referring to Zion, as it says “Zion shall be plowed as a field…” (Micah 3:12) The Holy One said: pray before Me toward that city and I will hear from the heavens and heal your land. Therefore Yaakov said to his sons: “And we will arise and go up to Bet El…” (Genesis 35:3) They said back to him: what will we do there? He replied: this is what the Holy One said to me “Arise and go up to Bet El…” (Genesis 35:1)"

R’ Shmuel replied: When the Holy One wanted to create the world, He wrapped Himself in light, as it says “You enwrap Yourself with light like a garment…” (Psalms 104:2) He said to him: you whisperd this to me, why? He replied: just as I received this tradition in a whisper, so too I passed it on to you in a whisper. R’ Tanchuma bar Aba said to him: have we not already heard R’ Yitzchak expound this in public? From when was the Holy One magnified? Once He created heaven and earth. And in whose merit did He create it? In the merit of Israel, as it says “Israel is holy to the Lord, the first of His grain…” (Jeremiah 2:3) R’ Aba bar Kahana said: it is written ‘her grain,’ why do we read it as His grain? Because we only eat from the fruits and not from the principle, which continues to exist for us in the world to come. Another explanation. Heaven and earth were created in the merit of the Torah, as it says “And I placed My words into your mouth, and with the shadow of My hand I covered you, to plant the heavens and to found the earth …” (Isaiah 51:16) Another explanation. In the merit of Zion, as it says “…and to say to Zion you are My people.” (ibid.) ",

                "“And He called to Moshe…” (Vayikra 1:1) From where did He call him?  From the Tent of meeting. Let His name be blessed forever for he left the upper worlds and chose the lower to dwell in the Tabernacle because of His love for Israel. This is what Shlomo said “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You…” (Melachim I 8:27) Does a potter desire clay vessels?! It is comparable, so to speak, because He is the creator of all. However, due to His love “My soul yearns, yea, it pines for the courts…” (Tehillim 84:3) So to it says ‘and He called to Moshe from the Tent of Meeting.’ How great was Moshe! See what is written “And God called the light day…” (Bereshit 1:5) and here ‘He called to Moshe’ – this was a call and that was a call. Who is greater the captor or the captive? I would say the captive. See what is written ‘And God called the light day,’ and light only refers to Torah, as it says “For a commandment is a candle, and the Torah is light…” (Mishle 6:23). Moshe captured the whole Torah, as it says “You ascended on high, you took captives…” (Tehillim 68:19) The Holy One said to Moshe ‘in this world I made you the head over all of Israel and in the coming world when the righteous come to take their reward you will be at the head of them all, asit says “And he came at the head of the people; he did what is righteous for the Lord, and what is lawful with Israel.” (Devarim 33:21)"

And why is the burnt offering different than all of the other offerings? Because it is called ‘sacrifice of righteousness,’ as it says ‘Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt offering and a whole offering.’ The Holy One said to Moshe: since the burnt offering is so precious to Me, command Aharon and his sons that they be careful with it, to offer it before me…"

And on the day that it was erected below it was erected above, as it says ‘And it was that on the day that Moses finished erecting the Tabernacle.’ There is no reason to use the sign of the direct object (et), why then did the Torah use it? Because this refers to the Tabernacle above.

                "“When you come into the land and plant…” This is what is written “And I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind.” (Kohelet 2:5) Doesn’t all humanity plant anything which they desire?! Whatever a man plants in the earth it produces, whether pepper or anything else – if a man plants it, it grows! Rather, people do not know the proper place for each particular plant. But Shlomo, who was wise, planted all manner of trees [as it says “And I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind”]. R’ Yannai said that Shlomo even planted pepper plants, and how did he plant them?! Shlomo was wise and knew the essential foundation (?) of the world. From where “from Tzion the sum of all beauty Gd appears” (Tehillim 50:2), from Tzion which includes within it the whole world. Why is it called the Foundation Stone? Because the whole world was founded from it. Shlomo knew which ligament extended to Kush and planted pepper on it, and it produced immediately, just as he said “and I planted in them trees of every kind.” Another explanation: “and I planted in them fruit trees of every kind…” Just as the navel is placed in the middle of a man, so is the Land of Israel the navel of the world, as it says “those who sit on the center of the land (Ezekiel 38:12). The land of Israel sits in the middle of the world, and Jerusalem in the middle of the land of Israel, and the Temple in the middle of Jerusalem, and the palace in the middle of the Temple, and the ark in the middle of the palace and the Foundation stone before the palace (should this say before the ark – search for other versions!) from which the world was founded. Shlomo, who was wise, understood the roots that went out from it to the whole world and planted on them all types of trees, and therefore he said – I made for myself gardens and orchards."
