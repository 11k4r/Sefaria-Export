                "“When you come into the land and plant…” This is what is written “And I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind.” (Kohelet 2:5) Doesn’t all humanity plant anything which they desire?! Whatever a man plants in the earth it produces, whether pepper or anything else – if a man plants it, it grows! Rather, people do not know the proper place for each particular plant. But Shlomo, who was wise, planted all manner of trees [as it says “And I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind”]. R’ Yannai said that Shlomo even planted pepper plants, and how did he plant them?! Shlomo was wise and knew the essential foundation (?) of the world. From where “from Tzion the sum of all beauty Gd appears” (Tehillim 50:2), from Tzion which includes within it the whole world. Why is it called the Foundation Stone? Because the whole world was founded from it. Shlomo knew which ligament extended to Kush and planted pepper on it, and it produced immediately, just as he said “and I planted in them trees of every kind.” Another explanation: “and I planted in them fruit trees of every kind…” Just as the navel is placed in the middle of a man, so is the Land of Israel the navel of the world, as it says “those who sit on the center of the land (Ezekiel 38:12). The land of Israel sits in the middle of the world, and Jerusalem in the middle of the land of Israel, and the Temple in the middle of Jerusalem, and the palace in the middle of the Temple, and the ark in the middle of the palace and the Foundation stone before the palace (should this say before the ark – search for other versions!) from which the world was founded. Shlomo, who was wise, understood the roots that went out from it to the whole world and planted on them all types of trees, and therefore he said – I made for myself gardens and orchards."
