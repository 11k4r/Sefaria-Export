                "<b>And on the eigth day you shall circumcise</b> It doesn't say here to make parties about the circumcision. Come and see how much Israel loves the commandments, that they make parties in order to observe the commandments and to have joy in them. The Holy One, Blessed is He says \"you guard the commandments and celebrate them, I will increase joy for you\", as it says (Isaiah 29:19) \"The humble also shall increase their joy in the LORD...\" [Beloved is circumcision, for The Holy One Blessed is He swore to Abraham that all who are circumcised will not descend to <i>Gehenom</i>, as it says (Genesis 15:18) \"In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying...\", and who descended to there? See what is says next (Genesis 15:19) \"the Kenite, and the Kenizzite...\". And so did Ezekiel see, as it says (Ezekiel 32:18-30) \"Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, with the daughters of the mighty nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. Whom dost thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised... Asshur is there and all her company; their graves...  There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised... There are the princes of the north...\". And so did Isaiah say (Isaiah 5:14) \"Therefore the nether-world hath enlarged her desire, And opened her mouth without measure\" — to he that doesn't have a statute [the words לבלי חק — \"without measure\" — can also be rendered \"to he that doesn't have the statute\"], and where [do we see that] it [the commandment to circumcise] is called a statue? As it says (Psalms 105:10) \"And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant\", because the Holy One Blessed is He placed His name with Israel. And what is the name and the seal that he placed in them? It is <i>Shaddai</i> [שדי], the <i>shin</i> [ש] is placed on the nose, the <i>dalet</i> [ד] on the hand, and the <i>yud</i> [י] on the [location of the] circumcision. Therefore when he goes to his eternal home, there is an angel appointed in the Garden of Eden who takes him and brings him into the Garden of Eden. And regarding the heretics and sinners, The Holy One Blessed is He commands the angel to pull his foreskin [i.e. reverse his circumcision], as it says (Psalms 55:21) \"He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; He hath profaned his covenant.\"]. It once happened that the evil Turnus Rufus asked Rabbi Akiva, \"which are the greater works, those of the Holy One Blessed is He or those of flesh and blood?\" He said to him, \"Those of flesh and blood are greater.\" Turnus Rufus said, \"But the Heavens and Earth — is Man able to make such as those?\" Rabbi Akiva said to him, \"Don't speak to me about something which is beyond Man, which he has no mastery over, rather speak of things which are found among people.\" He said, \"Why do you circumcise?\" He replied, \"I knew you were going to ask me about that, which is why I started by telling you that the works of Man are better than the works of the Holy One Blessed is He.\" Rabbi Akiva brought him stalks [of grain] and loaves [of bread]. He said to him, \"These are the works of the Holy One Blessed is He, and these are the works of Man.\" He said, \"Those are no better than than the stalks.' Turnus Rufus [then] said to him, \"If He wants circumcision, why does the infant not emerge circumcised from his mother's womb?\" Rabbi Akiva said to him ,\"And why does his umbilical chord emerge with him, [so] he hangs from the belly, and his mother [has to] cut it? And this that you said 'Why doesn't he emerge circumcised?', [the reason is] because the Holy One Blessed is He gave the Israel the commandments only in order to refine them [Israel] through them [the commandments].  And that's why David said (Psalms 18:31) (all) 'the word of the LORD is refined.'\""

                "...\"And it was that Isaac was old: Our sages taught us about [whether or not] a blind person can fulfill a congregation's obligation when standing in front of the ark [i.e. leading services]. Thus our sages taught us that a blind person can spread out his cloak [i.e. recite prayers on behalf of others] for the Sh'ma and its translation, however he cannot go before the ark and he cannot read Torah nor can he raise his hands [i.e. bless the people as a priest]. Rabbi Yehuda says all do not see the light in his days cannot spread the cloak [i.e. recite prayers on behalf of others] for the Sh'ma since it would be as if he was a false witness. As [the prayer leader] says: \"Blessed is the Fashioner of lights\" and yet [the blind prayer leader] does not say light in his days. You find that all who become blind in his eyes is as if they have died. How? Rashbi said \"The Holy One Blessed Be He does not attach [God's] name to the righteous in their lifetime rather after they died, as it says (in Psalms 16:3) \"As to the holy and might ones that are in the land, etc.\" When do they become holy? When they are buried in the land [of Israel] since the entire time of their life God does not attach [God's] name to them - why is this the case? Since God does not believe that the evil inclination did not cause them to err [in their lifetime]. Yet once they die, the Holy One Blessed Be He attaches [God's] name to them, and thus we find that the Holy One Blessed Be He attaches [God's] name to Isaac the righteous in his lifetime as he says to Jacob (Genesis 28:13): \"The God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac.\" Rabbi B'rakhyah and the rabbis [tried to answer the question \"why did the text say God of Isaac when Isaac was still alive at this time?]: The rabbis said \"he saw his ashes as if he was heaped upon the altar.\" And Rabbi B'rakhyah said \"since his eyes became blind it was as if he died since he was buried in his house and the evil inclination stopped [influencing him]. Thus it is written \"and it was that Isaac was old.\""

                "And why did He say Miriam first and Aharon afterwards? However it was because she started first and therefore, the verse mentioned her first. And what did they say? \"but was it only to Moshe that God spoke?\" (Numbers 12:2) That is to say did He only speak to Moshe that he separated from his wife? \"Did he not also speak to us?\" (Ibid.) In the same way did He speak to us and we have not separated from the way of the world (marital relations). And how did Miriam know that Moshe separated from the woman? Rabbi Natan said, \"Miriam was alongside Tsipporah when they said to Moshe, 'Eldad and Meidad are prophesying in the camp' (Numbers 11:27); and when Tzipporah heard, she said, 'Woe to the wives of these [men]!' And from what time did Moshe separate? In fact, when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe at Sinai before the giving of the Torah that he should sanctify the people, and say to them, 'for three days do not come close to a woman.' (Exodus 19:15) They [then] separated from their wives and Moshe separated from this wife. And after the giving of the Torah, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, 'Go tell them, \"you return to your tents.\" But you stay here with me,' (Deuteronomy 5:27-28) and do not go back to the way of the world. And when Tzipporah said, 'Woe to the wives of these - they are called to prophecy [and] will be separating from their wives just like my husband separated from me. And from then, Miriam knew and told Aharon. And if Miriam who did not have intention to disgrace Moshe was punished, all the more so with one who recounts the disgrace of of his fellow with evil speech, will that person be punished with <i>tsaarat</i> (a Biblical skin disease).\" ... \"And the Lord said suddenly\" (Numbers 12:4) When he revealed Himself to them suddenly and they were impure [as a result of] the way of the world, they yelled out, \"Water, water;\" to show that Moshe acted properly when he separated from his wife, after the Divine Presence revealed Itself to him constantly, and there was no [longer a] set time for speaking [with God.

The one who says lend him and I will give it to you.\" When he takes and places it in the hand of the guarantor, he is responsible.  And who was this guarantor?  This was Judah, as he said, '''Send him with me and I will return him to you.'  And he said, 'My son will not go down with you...If harm occurs to him.....'(Genesis 42:37-8).\"  From here you learn that one who goes out on the way, Satan accuses him.  Rabbi Yossi ben Chanina says that we learn that women die at the time of childbirth because of three transgressions.  Why at the time of childbirth?  Because Satan accuses at the time of danger.  Benjamin descended with his brothers and they took corn. Joseph commanded and he put the goblet in his sack.  Before they had gone far, he sent after them.  He said to them, 'How could you do such an evil thing?' He said, \"Whoever is found to have the goblet in his hand will be my slave.'  When it was found in the sack of Benjamin, each one of them turned his face away and who stood against him?  The guarantor.  \"And Judah came near (Genesis 44:18).\""

Thus you find Aaron told them, \"Break off the gold rings\" (Exodus 32:2), and the women did not want to and they protested against their husbands, as it says, \"and all the nation broke off the golden rings which were in their ears\" (Exodus 32:3), and women did not participate in the incident of the calf.  And so too, in the incident of the spies, [the women] did not participate \"and when [the spies] returned, they caused all the congregation to murmur against [Moses]\" (Numbers 14:36), and they decreed a decree, as they said, \"we can not go up\" (Numbers 13:31), but the women were not in agreement with them, just as is written above regarding the matter: \"because God had said of them: 'they will surely die in the wilderness' and there was not left of them a man\" (Numbers 26:65) - \"a man\" and not a woman, for they did not want to enter to the Land, but the women became close by seeking a portion in the Land. And thus this episode was written next to [the death of Miriam], from which the men broke down fences and women erected fences. "

What grief was there over there? They made a war to kill Avraham, our father, as it is stated (Genesis  14:2), \"made war.\" [It is comparable] to a dear friend of a king who entered a province, and on his account was the king [concerned] about that whole province. [Then people] came and grappled with him with words. And when he wanted to leave, they all said to him, \"Woe that the king will no longer be concerned about the province as he was\": So [too,] was Avraham a dear friend of the Holy One, blessed be He - as it is written about him (Isaiah 41:8), \"the seed of Avraham, my dear one\"; and it is written (Genesis 12:3), \"and through you shall all the families of the world be blessed.\" And when the kings came and grappled with him, they all said, \"Woe that the Holy One, blessed be He, will not be concerned with the world as He was; since He was concerned with the world for his sake.\" This is [the meaning of] that which the verse stated (Genesis 14:7), \"And they came to Ein Mishpat (which can be understand as the eye of justice)\" - Rabbi Acha said, \"They sought to grapple with no less than the eyeball of the world.\" They said, \"They sought to blind they eye that [suppressed] the trait of [strict] judgment in the world.\" [The verse continues -] \"It (<i>hee</i>) is Kadesh,\" [but] it is written, \"he (<i>hu</i>) is Kadesh\"; meaning to say, he sanctified (<i>hu kidesh</i>) the name of the Holy One, blessed be He and went down to the fiery furnace. When they saw that the things were like this, they cried out. (2) \"And it was in the days of Achaz the son of Yoshiah, King of Yehudah\" (Isaiah 7:1). What grief was there over there? \"It is what is stated by the verse (Isaiah 9:11), \"Aram is in front and the Philistines are behind, etc.\" It [is comparable to a king that gave his son over to a mentor, and the mentor hated him. He said, \"If I kill him, I will become liable for death. Rather, I will take away his nourishment from him and he will die on his own\": So did the evil Achaz say, \"If there are no goats, there will be no rams; if there is no flock, there will be no shepherd, [and] where will the world be?\" So did he say, \"If there are no masters, there will be no students; if there are no students, there will be no sages; if there is no Torah, there will be no synagogues and study halls.\" What did he do? He passed all the synagogues and study halls and sealed them. And this [is the meaning of] that which the verse states (Isaiah 8:16), \"Bind up the message; seal the instruction with My disciples.\" And when they saw that the things were like this, they all started to cried out, \"Woe that the world is being destroyed\" - when [study of] the Torah was negated, that was in the days of Achaz. (3) \"And it was in the days of Yehoyakim the son of Yoshiyahu\" (Jeremiah 1:3). What grief was there over there? \"I looked at the earth, and behold it was empty and void; at the heavens and their light was not.\" [It is comparable] to edicts of the kings that were brought to the provinces of the kingdom. In each and every province, when it came to their hands, everyone would stand on their feet, uncover their heads and read them with fear, trembling and perspiration. But when they were brought to the province of the king, they tore them up and burned them: When the Holy One, blessed be He, sends His messenger to the nations of the world, they repent, cover themselves in sackcloth and fast - as did the people of Nineveh, as it is stated (Jonah 3:7), \"from the order of the king and his principals, etc.\" They, may their memory be blessed, said, \"One who had a beam or a stone that was stolen in his house would destroy the house and remove it and return the theft.\" And because of this did Yonah fear to prophecy to Nineveh. As Rabbi Tarfon said, \"The fish was designated, etc.\" And the nations of the world are afraid in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, and [so, they are] close to repentance, whereas Israel is stiff-necked. This is what the verse stated (Jeremiah 36:23), \"And it was when Yehudi would read three columns or four\" - meaning to say, he read four verses - and in the fifth verse, he read, \"And her tormentors became the head\" (Lamentations 1:5) - and it is is written (Jeremiah 36:23), \"he would tear it with a scribe's blade and throw it into the fire until the end of all of the scroll.\" And when they saw this, everyone began to cry out, \"Woe for the decree that is hanging over us.\" And the other (4) - \"And it was in the days of Achashverosh\" (Esther 1:1). What grief was there over there? [It is comparable] to a king that had a vineyard, and he had three enemies. What did they do? One cut the small berries, the second ripped the clusters and the third uprooted the vines: The king is King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He; His vineyard is Israel, as it is stated (Isaiah 5:7), \"For a vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel\"; [And] their three enemies are Pharaoh, Nevukhadnetsar and Haman. Pharaoh began with the small berries, as it is stated (Exodus 1:22), \"Any son that is born, throw him into the river.\" Nevukhadnetsar ripped the clusters, as it is stated, \"the craftsmen and the smiths.\" Who are the craftsmen (<i>charash</i>)? These are the ones that pray the mute prayer silently, and are victorious with their prayer over all the nations of the world. The smiths?  That all the nations of the world come in a vice in front of them but [then] flee, as they put a vice on all the nations - and Nevukhadnetsar come to destroy them; and he destroyed the craftsmen and the smiths, and exiled them. The evil Haman [then] came [to] uproot the vines, as it is stated (Esther 3:13), \"to annihilate, to kill and to destroy.\" Everyone began to cry out, \"Woe,\" and they mourned in front of the Omnipresent. (5) \"And it was in the days when the judges ruled\" (Ruth 1:1) - there was famine there; and what grief is greater than famine? And from where [do we know] that there was famine? As it is stated (Ruth 1:1), \"and there was a famine in the land.\" And why was there a famine? Because Israel and the judges were not judging true judgement; as it is is stated, \"And it was in the days when the judges ruled\" - [and] we find [following it], \"he\", which indicates evildoers. [As] so do we find, \"he was Datan and Aviram\" (Numbers 26:9); \"he was Achashverosh\" (Esther 1:1); \"he was [...] Achaz\" (II Chronicles 28:22). So too were the judges. And to what is the matter comporable? To a province that was liable a tax to the king. [So] he sent collectors to collect it. The people of the province rose and smote the collectors and hung them. The judgment that they were liable - as they appointed other judges for themselves - they did to the collectors. So did they do at that time, as Elimelekh would judge the judges; [since] he was a strongman and there were many men below him. He saw the distress and the famine, but he did not warn the sinners to repent from their evil. And he stopped living in Beit Lechem for himself to live in the field of Moav - to sustain his soul during the famine, and the soul of his wife during the famine, and the soul of his sons; and he did not know that [it is] the Torah that sustains its masters and not the vanities of the world. And he was one who was important, as it is stated (Ruth 1:1), \"and a man went from Beit Lechem, Yehudah.\" And we only say, \"man,\" about an important man, as it is stated (Numbers 12:3), \"And the man, Moshe, was very humble.\" As Elimelekh was an important man, as they would consider him [so] in his place - and [yet] he went to save his soul and the soul of his household, and did not trouble himself about the matters of the community; even as he was an important man and they would have believed his words, [such as] to make them repent from their evil and bring them to repentance. And therefore, it occurred to him as it is written in the verse (Ruth 1:3), \"And Elimelekh, the husband of Naomi died.\" And so [too,] his sons died, as it is stated (Ruth 1:5), \"And [...his] two [sons,] Machlon and Khilayon died, and the woman survived her two children and her husband.\" As so were they judging their judges, like Sodom. Rabbi Shimon ben Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, \"Any place that it is stated, 'and it was (<i>vayechi</i>),' it is used for grief and it is used for joy. And when for grief, there is no grief like it, and when for joy, there is no joy like it.\" (The text is missing the following integral part of the midrash, found in Bereishit Rabbah 42:3 and other places: Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman came and divided it, \"Any place that it is stated 'it will be,' it is used for joy; [but] 'and it was' [is for] grief.\") The Sages responded, \"Behold 'And God said, \"<i>Vayechi</i> (here used as a command form, and not past tense) light\"' [is] joy!\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as the world did not merit to use that light. As so did Rabbi Yehudah bar Simon say, '[Regarding] the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, created on the first day, Adam [could] look and observe from [one] end of the world to the [other] end. [But] since the Holy One, blessed be He, saw the deeds of the generation of Enosh and the generation of the flood, He arose and hid it from them. That is [the meaning of] what the verse states (Job 38:15), \"From the wicked is their light withheld.\" And to where is it hidden? [It is] in the Garden of Eden, for the righteous ones, as it is stated (Psalms 97:11), \"Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the straight-hearted.\"'\" They responded to him further, \"It states, 'And it was evening and it was morning, one day.'\" He said to them, \"On that day too, it is not of joy, as all the acts of the first day are destined to wither, as it is stated (Isaiah 51:6), 'when the heavens melt away like smoke and the earth wither like a garment.'\" They responded to him, \"Behold, the [acts of] the second day, the third day, the fourth day, the fifth day, the sixth day.\" He said to them, \"They too are not of joy, as all the acts of the six days of creation require further action - for example, wheat needs to be ground; mustard needs to be mellowed; lupine need to be mellowed.\" They responded to him, \"[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yosef and he was a successful man' (Genesis 39:7)?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as from this that 'bear' chanced upon him, as it is stated in the verse, 'after' - 'And it was after these things, and the wife of his master raised, etc. (Genesis 39:7).\" They responded to him, \"[And what about,] 'And it was that the Lord was with Yehoshua, and his reputation was in all the land' (Joshua 6:27)?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin, fell at that time; as it is stated (Joshua 7:5), 'And the men of Ai smote of them, like thirty-six men' - and the master said, 'That is Yair the son of Menashe, whose weight corresponded to the majority of the Sanhedrin.\" They responded to him, \"And is it not written (I Samuel 18:14), 'And it was that David was successful in all of his ways and the Lord was with him'?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as enmity descended into the heart of Shaul from this, as it is stated (I Samuel 18:9), 'And it was that Shaul eyed David.'\" They responded to him, \"And is it not written (II Samuel 7:1), 'And it was when the king sat in his house and the Lord allowed him rest from all of his enemies'?\" He said to them, \"It too is not of joy, as on that same day, Natan the prophet came to David and said to him, 'However you will not build the House' (I Kings 8:19).\" They said to him, \"Behold, we have said what is ours; [now] say what is yours - that 'and it will be' is joy.\" He said to them, \"'And it will be on that day that the mountains will drip with nectar' (Joel 4:18), that will be in the days of the messiah, and there will be great joy for Israel. And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that a man shall save alive a heifer of the herd and two sheep' (Isaiah 7:21). And so [too,] 'And it will be on that day that living waters will come out from Jerusalem' (Zechariah 14:8). And so [too,] 'And he will be like a tree planted over streams of water' (Psalms 1:3). And so [too,] 'And the remnant of Yaakov will be among many nations' (Michah 5:6).\" They said to him, \"But behold, it is written (Jermiah 38:28), \""

                "\"These are the accounts of the Mishkan...\" (Sh. 38:21)  Brass were the [vessels for] the offering [Sh. 38:29], and brass were the utensils [kalot], and thus is the Greek term for bride [kalah] 'nymph'.  You should know, that back when Israel was enslaved in Egypt, Pharaoh issued a decree that men could not sleep in their own homes, in order to make marital relations impossible.  Rabbi Shimon bar Halafta says, what did the women of Israel do?  They went down to the river [Nile] to draw water.  The Holy One of Blessing invited small fish to swim up into their vessels for them.  The women sold the fish, and with parts of the proceeds cooked food and took wine and went out to the fields.  There they fed their husbands, as it says, \"all of their labors were in the fields\" (Sh. 1:14).  As they were eating and drinking, the women opened up mirrors, gazing at themselves along with their husbands.  One [member of the couple] would say, \"I'm more beautiful than you,\" and the other would say, \"I'm more beautiful than you!\"  In this fashion, they re-accustomed themselves to sexual desire, and they were fruitful and multiplied.  The Holy One of Blessing made the women pregnant immediately.  Our teachers say, some women bore two in a single pregnancy.  And some say, six in each womb.  And some say, twelve in each womb.  And some say, 60 multitudes.  Those who say \"two\" base their interpretation on the phrase, \"were fruitful and swarmed\" (Sh. 1:7).  Those who say \"six\", on \"were fruitful and swarmed, multiplied and became mighty [in number], more and more\" (Sh. 1:7), so six [descriptors].  The one who says \"twelve\", \"fruitful\" is two [in the plural], swarmed is two, etc., so twelve.  The one who says, \"sixty multitudes\", it is because the verse says of fish, \"let the waters swarm\" (Br. 1:20), and thus uses the same term, \"swarm\".  And all of these accountings are because of the mirrors, because the verse says of them, \"the land was filled by them\" (Sh. 1:7).  And the more the people were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread out (Sh. 1:12).  By the merit of these mirrors, which the women used to make themselves visible to their husbands and to re-accustom them to sexual desire in the midst of enslavement, there were established all of the women's working-force [tz'ovot], as it says, \"all of ha-Shem's hosts [tziva'ot] went forth from Egypt\" (Sh. 12:41).  And it says, \"ha-Shem brought out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.\"  Therefore, when ha-Shem told Moshe to make the Mishkan, all of Israel arose and made voluntary contributions.  Some brought silver and some brought gold or brass and onyx stones and stones for setting, they enthusiastically brought everything.  The women said, what do we possess to give voluntarily to the Mishkan?  They arose and brought the mirrors, went alongside to Moshe.  When Moshe saw these mirrors, he raged against them.  He said to all Israel, raise up your staffs and shatter the women's desire for these.  The Holy One of Blessings said to Moshe, \"Moshe, against these you despise.  Yet these mirrors, they raised all of these hosts in Egypt.  Lift them up and make from them a brass washing station and its brass pedestal for the priests, that from these [mirrors] the priests shall be sanctified.  As it says, \"They made the brass washing station and its brass pedestal from the mirrors of the women's working-force that was doing the work [tzav'u]\" (Sh. 38:8), that by means of these very mirrors, did all of these hosts [population] arise.  Therefore it is written, \"the brass for the offering [vessels] was seventy talents\" (Sh 28:29), brass of the vessels / brides.  The Holy One of Blessing said, in this world they were voluntary offerings for the Mishkan, to make atonement for them.  And in the future to come, I will grant atonement for them and will love them voluntarily, as it says, \"I will heal their backsliding, I will love them voluntarily\" (Hoshea 14:5).  They have said, for us, we have no Mishkan, no Temple.  May the prayer of our mouths be as the voluntary offering of the Mishkan.  As David says, \"May the voluntary offerings of my mouth be acceptable to You\" (Ps. 119:108)."

That on every קוצ (thorn)^(that is, every serif of every letter of the Torah) hang  תילי תילים (locks and locks) of laws. How so?
