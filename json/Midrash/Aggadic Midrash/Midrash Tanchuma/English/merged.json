                "<b>In the beginning God created.</b> This is per the verse (Prov. 3:19): \"God with wisdom founded the earth\" and when the Holy One Blessed Be He created His world, he consulted the Torah and created His World, as it says (Prov. 8:14) \"I have counsel and sound wisdom, I am understanding, I have strength.\" And with what was the Torah written? With black flame on white flame, as it is said (Song of Songs 5:11) \"his hair is wavy, black as a raven.\" What is meant by קוצותיו תלתלים (\"his hair is wavy\")? That on every קוצ (thorn)^(that is, every serif of every letter of the Torah) hang  תילי תילים (locks and locks) of laws. How so? It is written in it [the Torah] (Lev. 22:32): And do not desecrate [תחללו] My holy Name. If you change the [ח] to a [ה] you destroy the world ^(by making techalelu into tehalelu, and making the verse mean do not praise My holy Name). \"Every soul shall praise [תהלל] God\" (Psalms 150:6), if you change the [ה] a [ח] ^(techalel - shall desecrate) you destroy the world. Likewise, (Deut. 6:4) \"Hear O'Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One [אחד].\" If you change the [ד] to a [ר] you destroy the world, as it is said (Exo. 34:14) \"You will not bow down to other gods.\" [Elsewhere it is stated] (Jer. 5:12) \"They have belied Hashem.\"  If you change the [ב] to a [כ] you destroy the world. [Elsewhere it is stated] (Shmuel I 2:2) \"There is none holy as Hashem.\"  If you change the [כ] to a [ב] you destroy the world. And if just a letter is like this, how much more so a whole word. For this is it stated, \"his locks are like tresses.\" Therefore Dovid praised and said, (Psalms 119:96) \"Your commandment is exceedingly broad.\" [Likewise] it is said (Iyov 11:9) \"the measure thereof is longer than the earth...\" And it [the Torah] was the guide for all creation, as it is said (Prov. 8:30) \"then I was by Him, as a nursling.\" Do not read it as אמון [nurseling], but rather as אומן [guide].",

And there are those that say a horn was affixed to his [Kayin's] forehead. When Kayin killed Hevel, [Hevel] was discarded [on the ground] and Kayin did not know what to do. So the Holy One, Blessed is He, sent him two pure birds and one of them killed his fellow, and then dug the earth with its claws and buried it [the dead bird]. From this Kayin learned and dug and buried Hevel. Therefore, the birds have merited that their blood be covered [with earth]."

                "... the Holy One treated Am Yisrael righteously by preceding the exile of Tzidkiya with that of Yochanya in order that the oral Torah not be forgotten from among them. They were settled in their Torah in Babylon from that time until today and neither Edom nor Greece ruled over them, or declared destruction upon then. Even when the Messiah comes they will not see the birth pangs of the Messiah, as it says “Ho, Zion! Flee…” (Zechariah 2:11) From Edom and Greece, from their decrees. And it is written “Be in pain and kneel, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in confinement, for now you shall go forth from the city; and you shall dwell in the field…” (Micah 4:10) And it is written ‘and I shall dwell (shachanti),’ ‘in the field’ because even though one is exiled into the field my Presence (shechinati) will not move from you. “…and you shall come up to Babylon; there you shall be saved; there the Lord shall redeem you from the hand of your enemies.” (ibid.) This comes to teach you that the redemption begins from there, from there they will go up to Jerusalem ““And saviors shall ascend Mt. Zion…” and at that time “…the Lord shall have the kingdom.” (Ovadiah 1:21)",

If someone says to you that the exiles are gathered and Jerusalem is not rebuilt do not believe it, as it says “The Lord is the builder of Jerusalem…” and afterwards it says “He will gather the outcasts of Israel.” (Psalms 147:2) Israel said before the Holy One: Master of the world! Has Jerusalem not already been rebuilt and destroyed? He replied to them: through sins it was destroyed and you were exiled from within her, but now I will build her and I will never destroy her, as it says “For the Lord has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory.” (Psalms 102:17)"

Since the Holy One declared his intention to bring His Presence to rest upon it and to make there the Holy Temple, He said ‘it is not the way of a king to dwell in a valley, but rather in a place which is elevated, superior, beautified and visible to all. Immediately the Holy One hinted to the surroundings of the valley that the mountains should gather together in one place to make a place for the Presence. Therefore it is called Mount Moriah, because from the fear (yirah) of the Holy One it was made a mountain"

The verse earlier stated, \"And Sarah died, etc.\" Avraham began to cry for her, and to recite Ashet Chayil: \"A woman of valor, who can find one? Her husband's heart trusts in her\" - when was this? When he said to her \"Say that you are my sister.\" \"She repays his good, and not his bad, all the days of her life. She susses out linen and cloth\" - this is between Isaac and Yishmael, as when she said, \"kick out this maidservant and her son.\" \"She is like a merchant's ships\" - [this is like what is stated:] \" And she was taken into Pharoah's palace,\" and then later, \"and she was sent to Avimelech.\" \"She rises in the night\" - when was this? When \"Avraham rose early in the morning.\"  \"She considered a field and then purchases it\" - she considered, and then bought, the field of Machpela, where she was ultimately buried there, as is stated, \"afterwards, Avraham buried Sarah. \"She girds her loins with might\" - when was this? When the angels came, as is stated, \"Avraham hurried towards the tent, towards Sarah...\" \"She senses that her enterprise is good\" - when the kings approached them, as is stated, \"And [Avraham] divided his troops.\" \"Her hands are spread towards the distaff\" - she would give food to the passersby.  \"Her palm was outstretched to the poor\" - she would give tzedaka and cloth the naked. \"Her house needn't fear snow\" - this is Gehenom, and why [needn't they fear]? \"For the whole house is clothed in crimson.\" [Don't read shanim, crimson, but rather shnaim] two - Shabbat and circumcision. \"She makes for herself a sheet\" - this is the Kohanic garb. \"From the fruit of her handiwork she plants a vineyard\" - this is Israel, as is stated in Isaiah, \"the vineyard of God are the multitudes of Israel.\" \"Her husband is known at the gates of the city\" - when  Avraham requested from the Hittites a burial plot. \"She makes garments\" - this is circumcision, as it states in Psalms, \"God's secret is revealed to those who fear God.\" \"She is dressed in strength and splendor\" - these are the clouds of glory that would surround Sarah's tent. \"Her mouth speaks to wisdom\" - when is this - when she said, \"approach my maidservant.\" \"She scouts the needs of her household\" - everyday, Sarah would gaze outwards, anticipating when the angels would return who'd promised they'd come back in a year's time when she would become pregnant. \"Her children stand and praise her,\" as is stated, \"Who would have said to Avraham that Sarah would nurse?\" \"Many daughters are valorous\" - these are the non-Jewish nations; \"but you are greater than them all\" - as it is stated, \"Look up at Avraham your father, and to Sarah who birthed you. \"Give her from the fruit of her labors\" - as it is stated, \"these are the years of Sarah's life.\"",

                "...\"And it was that Isaac was old: Our sages taught us about [whether or not] a blind person can fulfill a congregation's obligation when standing in front of the ark [i.e. leading services]. Thus our sages taught us that a blind person can spread out his cloak [i.e. recite prayers on behalf of others] for the Sh'ma and its translation, however he cannot go before the ark and he cannot read Torah nor can he raise his hands [i.e. bless the people as a priest]. Rabbi Yehuda says all do not see the light in his days cannot spread the cloak [i.e. recite prayers on behalf of others] for the Sh'ma since it would be as if he was a false witness. As [the prayer leader] says: \"Blessed is the Fashioner of lights\" and yet [the blind prayer leader] does not say light in his days. You find that all who become blind in his eyes is as if they have died. How? Rashbi said \"The Holy One Blessed Be He does not attach [God's] name to the righteous in their lifetime rather after they died, as it says (in Psalms 16:3) \"As to the holy and might ones that are in the land, etc.\" When do they become holy? When they are buried in the land [of Israel] since the entire time of their life God does not attach [God's] name to them - why is this the case? Since God does not believe that the evil inclination did not cause them to err [in their lifetime]. Yet once they die, the Holy One Blessed Be He attaches [God's] name to them, and thus we find that the Holy One Blessed Be He attaches [God's] name to Isaac the righteous in his lifetime as he says to Jacob (Genesis 28:13): \"The God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac.\" Rabbi B'rakhyah and the rabbis [tried to answer the question \"why did the text say God of Isaac when Isaac was still alive at this time?]: The rabbis said \"he saw his ashes as if he was heaped upon the altar.\" And Rabbi B'rakhyah said \"since his eyes became blind it was as if he died since he was buried in his house and the evil inclination stopped [influencing him].

R’ Yitzchak said: now we have no prophet, no priest, no offerings. No Sanctuary, no altar – who will atone for us? Though the Holy Temple is destroyed, all that is left in our hands is prayer. Therefore “O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive…” (Daniel 9:19) Have you not said “…My eyes and My heart shall be there at all times”? (Kings I 9:3) See what is written “Be in pain and kneel, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in confinement, for now you shall go forth from the city; and you shall dwell in the field…” (Micah 4:10) It is written ‘I dwell,’ meaning that even though I exiled you from there my Presence will not move from that place. ‘Field’ here is referring to Zion, as it says “Zion shall be plowed as a field…” (Micah 3:12) The Holy One said: pray before Me toward that city and I will hear from the heavens and heal your land. Therefore Yaakov said to his sons: “And we will arise and go up to Bet El…” (Genesis 35:3) They said back to him: what will we do there?

                "Our sages teach us, \"Who is the guarantor who is responsible for repayment [of a loan]?\"  Thus taught our sages:  Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas says, \"Who is the guarantor that is responsible for repayment?  The one who says lend him and I will give it to you.\" When he takes and places it in the hand of the guarantor, he is responsible.  And who was this guarantor?  This was Judah, as he said, '''Send him with me and I will return him to you.'  And he said, 'My son will not go down with you...If harm occurs to him.....'(Genesis 42:37-8).\"  From here you learn that one who goes out on the way, Satan accuses him.  Rabbi Yossi ben Chanina says that we learn that women die at the time of childbirth because of three transgressions.  Why at the time of childbirth?  Because Satan accuses at the time of danger.  Benjamin descended with his brothers and they took corn. Joseph commanded and he put the goblet in his sack.  Before they had gone far, he sent after them.  He said to them, 'How could you do such an evil thing?' He said, \"Whoever is found to have the goblet in his hand will be my slave.'  When it was found in the sack of Benjamin, each one of them turned his face away and who stood against him?  The guarantor.  \"And Judah came near (Genesis 44:18).\""

                "... and why was the Divine Presence found in Egypt? To teach you that until the land of Israel was chosen, all lands were fit for revelation. Once the land of Israel was chosen, all of the other lands were disqualified. Before Jerusalem was chosen all of the land of Israel was fit for revelation, once Jerusalem was chosen the Divine word removed itself from (the rest of) the land of Israel. Until the Eternal House was chosen, Jerusalem was fit for the Divine Presence, once the Eternal House was chosen, Jerusalem lost this status as it is written “For the Lord has chosen Zion; He desired it for His habitation.” (Psalms 132:13) And it says “This is My resting place forever; here I shall dwell for I desired it.” (Psalms 132:14) Until Aharon was chosen, all of Israel were fit for the priesthood, as it says “…it is like an eternal covenant of salt…” (Numbers 18:19) Once they were chosen, the rest of Israel was disqualified, as it says “It shall be for him and for his descendants after him [as] an eternal covenant…” (Numbers 25:13) Until David was chosen, all of Israel were fit for the kingship. Once David was chosen all of Israel lost that status, as it says “It is not for you and for us to build a House for our God, but we ourselves shall build for the Lord God of Israel…” (Ezra 4:3) And why was there speech with the prophets outside the land? In the merit of the forefathers, as it says “So says the Lord: A voice is heard on high…” (Jeremiah 31:14) and it is written “So says the Lord: Refrain your voice from weeping…” (Jeremiah 31:15) And even outside the land speech only came to the prophets in a pure place. So you find with Daniel “…I was beside the river Ulai,” (Daniel 8:2) and so too “…I was beside the great river, the Tigris.” (Daniel 10:4) And so too Ezekiel says “…I was in the midst of the exile by the river Chebar…” (Ezekiel 1:1) this is the Tigris. From the fact that He spoke with him outside of the land, we know that He spoke with him in the land, as it says “Arise, go out to the plain, and there I shall speak with you.” (Ezekiel 3:22)"

R’ Shmuel replied: When the Holy One wanted to create the world, He wrapped Himself in light, as it says “You enwrap Yourself with light like a garment…” (Psalms 104:2) He said to him: you whisperd this to me, why? He replied: just as I received this tradition in a whisper, so too I passed it on to you in a whisper. R’ Tanchuma bar Aba said to him: have we not already heard R’ Yitzchak expound this in public? From when was the Holy One magnified? Once He created heaven and earth. And in whose merit did He create it? In the merit of Israel, as it says “Israel is holy to the Lord, the first of His grain…” (Jeremiah 2:3) R’ Aba bar Kahana said: it is written ‘her grain,’ why do we read it as His grain? Because we only eat from the fruits and not from the principle, which continues to exist for us in the world to come. Another explanation. Heaven and earth were created in the merit of the Torah, as it says “And I placed My words into your mouth, and with the shadow of My hand I covered you, to plant the heavens and to found the earth …” (Isaiah 51:16) Another explanation.

From the abundance of the love for the one below He made another above, as it says “Behold on My hands have I engraved you; your walls are before Me always.” (Isaiah 49:16) And for what was it destroyed? “Your sons have hastened; those who destroy you and those who lay you waste shall go forth from you.” (Isaiah 49:17) For this it was destroyed. David said so as well “The built-up Jerusalem is like a city that was joined together within itself.” (Psalms 122:3) That is to say, like a city which God (Yah) built. And the Yerushalmi translated this into Aramaic as ‘a city built in the heavens to join as one with that on the earth.’ And He swore that His Presence would not enter into the one above until the one below is rebuilt. How precious is Israel before the Holy One! And how do we know this is so? Because it is written “In your midst is the Holy One, and I will not enter a city.” (Hoshea 11:9) And it says “’And now, what have I here,’ says the Lord, ‘that My people has been taken for nothing.’” (Isaiah 52:5) That is to say ‘and now, what have I here,’ meaning ‘what do I seek here in Jerusalem now that My people have been taken from it. Should I go there for nothing? I will not go. May it be His will that it be rebuilt, speedily in our day. "

                "“And He called to Moshe…” (Vayikra 1:1) From where did He call him?  From the Tent of Meeting. Let His name be blessed forever for he left the upper worlds and chose the lower, to dwell in the Tabernacle because of His love for Israel. This is what Shlomo said “But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain You…” (Melachim I 8:27) Does a potter desire clay vessels?! It is comparable, so to speak, because He is the creator of all. However, due to His love “My soul yearns, yea, it pines for the courts…” (Tehillim 84:3) So to it says ‘and He called to Moshe from the Tent of Meeting.’ How great was Moshe! See what is written “And God called the light day…” (Bereshit 1:5) and here ‘He called to Moshe’ – this was a call and that was a call. Who is greater the captor or the captive? I would say the captive. See what is written ‘And God called the light day,’ and light only refers to Torah, as it says “For a commandment is a candle, and the Torah is light…” (Mishle 6:23). Moshe captured the whole Torah, as it says “You ascended on high, you took captives…” (Tehillim 68:19) The Holy One said to Moshe ‘in this world I made you the head over all of Israel and in the coming world when the righteous come to take their reward you will be at the head of them all, as it says “And he came at the head of the people; he did what is righteous for the Lord, and what is lawful with Israel.” (Devarim 33:21)"

                "And why did He say Miriam first and Aharon afterwards? However it was because she started first and therefore, the verse mentioned her first. And what did they say? \"but was it only to Moshe that God spoke?\" (Numbers 12:2) That is to say did He only speak to Moshe that he separated from his wife? \"Did he not also speak to us?\" (Ibid.) In the same way did He speak to us and we have not separated from the way of the world (marital relations). And how did Miriam know that Moshe separated from the woman? Rabbi Natan said, \"Miriam was alongside Tsipporah when they said to Moshe, 'Eldad and Meidad are prophesying in the camp' (Numbers 11:27); and when Tzipporah heard, she said, 'Woe to the wives of these [men]!' And from what time did Moshe separate? In fact, when the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe at Sinai before the giving of the Torah that he should sanctify the people, and say to them, 'for three days do not come close to a woman.' (Exodus 19:15) They [then] separated from their wives and Moshe separated from this wife. And after the giving of the Torah, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, 'Go tell them, \"you return to your tents.\" But you stay here with me,' (Deuteronomy 5:27-28) and do not go back to the way of the world. And when Tzipporah said, 'Woe to the wives of these - they are called to prophecy [and] will be separating from their wives just like my husband separated from me. And from then, Miriam knew and told Aharon. And if Miriam who did not have intention to disgrace Moshe was punished, all the more so with one who recounts the disgrace of of his fellow with evil speech, will that person be punished with <i>tsaarat</i> (a Biblical skin disease).\" ... \"And the Lord said suddenly\" (Numbers 12:4) When he revealed Himself to them suddenly and they were impure [as a result of] the way of the world, they yelled out, \"Water, water;\" to show that Moshe acted properly when he separated from his wife, after the Divine Presence revealed Itself to him constantly, and there was no [longer a] set time for speaking [with God.

And why is the burnt offering different than all of the other offerings? Because it is called ‘sacrifice of righteousness,’ as it says ‘Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt offering and a whole offering.’ The Holy One said to Moshe: since the burnt offering is so precious to Me, command Aharon and his sons that they be careful with it, to offer it before me…"

And since they made the Tabernacle it was filled with His glory, as it says “Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting…” (Shemot 40:35) The princes declared ‘this is the time to offer sacrifices in joy, because the Divine Presence has come to rest among us.’ From where did they know this?

                "“The chieftains of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, presented…” (Numbers 7:2) You find that in the hour that Moshe declared “Take from yourselves an offering…” (Exodus 35:5) what did the chieftains do? They said: Moshe didn’t know what to say to us other than that we should make the Tabernacle. What did they do? They did not give a voluntary offering, saying: these others are making the Tabernacle, and to us he says to give a voluntary offering?! The Holy One said to them: by your lives, I will make it known to you that I do not need you. What is written there? “…and they brought him more gifts every morning.” (Exodus 36:3) R’ Yochanan said: they brought all the gifts of the Tabernacle in the course of two mornings, and there was more than what was needed. And from where do we learn that this was so? “And the work was sufficient for them for all the work, to do it and to leave over.” (Exodus 36:7) It is further written “Moses saw the entire work, and lo! they had done it-as the Lord had commanded, so had they done. So Moses blessed them.” (Exodus 39:43) With what blessing did he bless them? He said to them: may the Divine Presence rest on the works of your hands. In this world Moshe blessed them, but in the world to come the Holy One Himself in His glory will bless them, as it says “May the Lord bless you from Zion, and see the good of Jerusalem…” (Psalms 128:5)"

                "... And even Jehoshaphat, once he strengthened himself in the kingship, did not occupy himself with matters of kingship or honor, rather with matters of judgment as it says “And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and he strengthened himself over Israel.” (Chronicles II 17:1) What does it mean ‘he strengthened himself’? That he gathered strength and appointed judges, and it says “And his heart was uplifted in the ways of the Lord, and he further removed the high places and the asherim from Judah.” (Chronicles II 17:6) And was he haughty of spirit, that it says ‘his heart was uplifted’?! Rather this means that he appointed judges over them who knew how to go in the ways of the Lord, and to keep the ways of the Lord, “And he said to the judges, \"See what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the Lord, and [He] is with you in the matter of the judgment. And now, may the fear of the Lord be upon you; observe and do, for with the Lord your God there is neither injustice, favoritism, nor bribe-taking.” (Chronicles II 19:6-7) And if Moshe our teacher, who was not commanded about judges but rather was told by Yitro “But you shall choose out of the entire nation…” (Exodus 21:18), nevertheless appointed a Sanhedrin, we who were commanded by the Torah “You shall set up judges and law enforcement officials for yourself…” (Deuteronomy 16:18) all the more so. And from where do we learn that Moshe appointed a Sanhedrin? As it says “Moses chose men of substance out of all Israel…” (Exodus 18:25) Even Jerusalem was only praiseworthy because of judgment, as it says “Then your name went out among the nations for your beauty…” (Ezekiel 16:14) And what is beauty? It is judgment, as it says “Neither shall you glorify a poor man in his lawsuit.” (Exodus 23:3) And Jerusalem was only destroyed because of the corruption of judgment, as it says “…whose name is so befouled, in whom the turmoil is so great.” (Ezekiel 22:5) The name which you gained at first through judgment, you befouled, and it is written “…full of justice…” (Isaiah 1:21) This is what Jeremiah said to them “The kings of the earth did not believe…for the sins of her prophets, the iniquities of her priests…” (Lamentations 4:12-13) At that hour the Holy One swore that He Himself would exact payment from them and from the judges, as it says “Therefore, says the Master, the Lord of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel…” (Isaiah 1:24) ‘Therefore’ is always the language of an oath, as it says “And, therefore, I have sworn to the house of Eli…” (Samuel I 3:14) And the Mighty One (abir) means the head of the court (av bet din), as it says “…the chief of Saul's shepherds.” (Samuel I 21:8) This comes to teach you that the Holy One became the head of the court in order to exact retribution upon them. And from where do we learn that this is referring to the judges? See what is written afterwards “And I will restore your judges as at first…” (Isaiah 1:26) For this David said “He tells His words to Jacob…” (Psalms 147:19)"

                "(3) [23,10] “When a camp goes out against your enemies, you shall beware of everything evil.” (Devarim 23:10) There should be no levity among you so that you do not incur any liability. From whom should you learn? From Yiftach. What is written about him? “…and he was the son of a harlot…” (Shoftim 11:1) R’ Shimon ben Gamliel said that she brought her sister-wife into her house, and our Rabbis say that she was really a harlot, and because there was some levity in him all of the people fell upon him. Therefore it is written ‘you shall beware of everything evil’ and ‘If there is among you a man who is unclean…’ These are Israel who became impure through idolatry, as it says “…scatter them afar like a menstruant; 'Go out,' say to it.” (Yeshayahu 30:22) “…he shall go outside the camp…” (Devarim 23:11) that they were exiled to Bavel. “And it shall be, towards evening…”(Devarim 23:12) the evening of the kingdoms, and the Holy One purifies them as it says “…he shall bathe in water…” (ibid.) and it is written “When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion…” (Yeshayahu 4:4) “…and when the sun sets…” (Devraim 23:12) When the King Messiah comes of whom it is written “…and his throne is like the sun before Me.” (Tehillim 89:37) “…he may come within the camp” (Devarim 23:12) These are Israel, entering intp the Holy Temple. “And you shall have a designated place outside the camp…” (Devarim 23:13) this is the merit of Avraham. R’ Pinchas said- “…so that you can go out there,” to Bavel. “And you shall keep a stake in addition to your weapons…” (Devarim 23:14) Nevuchadnezar demanded that they serve an idol and they said “…let it be known to you, O king, that we will not worship your god…” (Daniel 3:18) “…and you shall return and cover your excrement.” (Devarim 23:14) The covering of idolatry that was in Jerusalem. “For the Lord, your God, goes along in the midst of your camp…” (Devarim 23:15) The Holy One will be revealed to them immediately and saved them from the fire. “Therefore, your camp shall be holy…” (ibid.) Afterwards He will sanctify them as it says “And they shall call them the holy people, those redeemed by the Lord…” (Yeshayahu 62:12)"

                "\"These are the accounts of the Mishkan...\" (Sh. 38:21)  Brass were the [vessels for] the offering [Sh. 38:29], and brass were the utensils [kalot], and thus is the Greek term for bride [kalah] 'nymph'.  You should know, that back when Israel was enslaved in Egypt, Pharaoh issued a decree that men could not sleep in their own homes, in order to make marital relations impossible.  Rabbi Shimon bar Halafta says, what did the women of Israel do?  They went down to the river [Nile] to draw water.  The Holy One of Blessing invited small fish to swim up into their vessels for them.  The women sold the fish, and with parts of the proceeds cooked food and took wine and went out to the fields.  There they fed their husbands, as it says, \"all of their labors were in the fields\" (Sh. 1:14).  As they were eating and drinking, the women opened up mirrors, gazing at themselves along with their husbands.  One [member of the couple] would say, \"I'm more beautiful than you,\" and the other would say, \"I'm more beautiful than you!\"  In this fashion, they re-accustomed themselves to sexual desire, and they were fruitful and multiplied.  The Holy One of Blessing made the women pregnant immediately.  Our teachers say, some women bore two in a single pregnancy.  And some say, six in each womb.  And some say, twelve in each womb.  And some say, 60 multitudes.  Those who say \"two\" base their interpretation on the phrase, \"were fruitful and swarmed\" (Sh. 1:7).  Those who say \"six\", on \"were fruitful and swarmed, multiplied and became mighty [in number], more and more\" (Sh. 1:7), so six [descriptors].  The one who says \"twelve\", \"fruitful\" is two [in the plural], swarmed is two, etc., so twelve.  The one who says, \"sixty multitudes\", it is because the verse says of fish, \"let the waters swarm\" (Br. 1:20), and thus uses the same term, \"swarm\".  And all of these accountings are because of the mirrors, because the verse says of them, \"the land was filled by them\" (Sh. 1:7).  And the more the people were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread out (Sh. 1:12).  By the merit of these mirrors, which the women used to make themselves visible to their husbands and to re-accustom them to sexual desire in the midst of enslavement, there were established all of the women's working-force [tz'ovot], as it says, \"all of ha-Shem's hosts [tziva'ot] went forth from Egypt\" (Sh. 12:41).  And it says, \"ha-Shem brought out the people of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.\"  Therefore, when ha-Shem told Moshe to make the Mishkan, all of Israel arose and made voluntary contributions.  Some brought silver and some brought gold or brass and onyx stones and stones for setting, they enthusiastically brought everything.  The women said, what do we possess to give voluntarily to the Mishkan?  They arose and brought the mirrors, went alongside to Moshe.  When Moshe saw these mirrors, he raged against them.  He said to all Israel, raise up your staffs and shatter the women's desire for these.  The Holy One of Blessings said to Moshe, \"Moshe, against these you despise.  Yet these mirrors, they raised all of these hosts in Egypt.  Lift them up and make from them a brass washing station and its brass pedestal for the priests, that from these [mirrors] the priests shall be sanctified.  As it says, \"They made the brass washing station and its brass pedestal from the mirrors of the women's working-force that was doing the work [tzav'u]\" (Sh. 38:8), that by means of these very mirrors, did all of these hosts [population] arise.  Therefore it is written, \"the brass for the offering [vessels] was seventy talents\" (Sh 28:29), brass of the vessels / brides.  The Holy One of Blessing said, in this world they were voluntary offerings for the Mishkan, to make atonement for them.  And in the future to come, I will grant atonement for them and will love them voluntarily, as it says, \"I will heal their backsliding, I will love them voluntarily\" (Hoshea 14:5).  They have said, for us, we have no Mishkan, no Temple.  May the prayer of our mouths be as the voluntary offering of the Mishkan.  As David says, \"May the voluntary offerings of my mouth be acceptable to You\" (Ps. 119:108)."

                "Let our rabbis teach us: one who passes before the ark [i.e., serves as precentor for the 'amidah] and errs by not mentioning the birkat haminim--from whence do we know that we make him repeat the prayer? That is what the rabbis taught: One who passes before the ark and errs in any or all of the blessings, we do not make him repeat the prayer. But if he errs in the birkat haminim, we make him repeat and recite it against his will. And why do we make him repeat it? We are concerned lest he is a min, for if he has some aspect of minut, he will curse himself and the congregation will answer \"amen.\""

                "<b>And on the eigth day you shall circumcise</b> It doesn't say here to make parties about the circumcision. Come and see how much Israel loves the commandments, that they make parties in order to observe the commandments and to have joy in them. The Holy One, Blessed is He says \"you guard the commandments and celebrate them, I will increase joy for you\", as it says (Isaiah 29:19) \"The humble also shall increase their joy in the LORD...\" [Beloved is circumcision, for The Holy One Blessed is He swore to Abraham that all who are circumcised will not descend to <i>Gehenom</i>, as it says (Genesis 15:18) \"In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying...\", and who descended to there? See what is says next (Genesis 15:19) \"the Kenite, and the Kenizzite...\". And so did Ezekiel see, as it says (Ezekiel 32:18-30) \"Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, with the daughters of the mighty nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. Whom dost thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised... Asshur is there and all her company; their graves...  There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised... There are the princes of the north...\". And so did Isaiah say (Isaiah 5:14) \"Therefore the nether-world hath enlarged her desire, And opened her mouth without measure\" — to he that doesn't have a statute [the words לבלי חק — \"without measure\" — can also be rendered \"to he that doesn't have the statute\"], and where [do we see that] it [the commandment to circumcise] is called a statue? As it says (Psalms 105:10) \"And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant\", because the Holy One Blessed is He placed His name with Israel. And what is the name and the seal that he placed in them? It is <i>Shaddai</i> [שדי], the <i>shin</i> [ש] is placed on the nose, the <i>dalet</i> [ד] on the hand, and the <i>yud</i> [י] on the [location of the] circumcision. Therefore when he goes to his eternal home, there is an angel appointed in the Garden of Eden who takes him and brings him into the Garden of Eden. And regarding the heretics and sinners, The Holy One Blessed is He commands the angel to pull his foreskin [i.e. reverse his circumcision], as it says (Psalms 55:21) \"He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; He hath profaned his covenant.\"]. It once happened that the evil Turnus Rufus asked Rabbi Akiva, \"which are the greater works, those of the Holy One Blessed is He or those of flesh and blood?\" He said to him, \"Those of flesh and blood are greater.\" Turnus Rufus said, \"But the Heavens and Earth — is Man able to make such as those?\" Rabbi Akiva said to him, \"Don't speak to me about something which is beyond Man, which he has no mastery over, rather speak of things which are found among people.\" He said, \"Why do you circumcise?\" He replied, \"I knew you were going to ask me about that, which is why I started by telling you that the works of Man are better than the works of the Holy One Blessed is He.\" Rabbi Akiva brought him stalks [of grain] and loaves [of bread]. He said to him, \"These are the works of the Holy One Blessed is He, and these are the works of Man.\" He said, \"Those are no better than than the stalks.' Turnus Rufus [then] said to him, \"If He wants circumcision, why does the infant not emerge circumcised from his mother's womb?\" Rabbi Akiva said to him ,\"And why does his umbilical chord emerge with him, [so] he hangs from the belly, and his mother [has to] cut it? And this that you said 'Why doesn't he emerge circumcised?', [the reason is] because the Holy One Blessed is He gave the Israel the commandments only in order to refine them [Israel] through them [the commandments].  And that's why David said (Psalms 18:31) (all) 'the word of the LORD is refined.'\""

                "“When you come into the land and plant…” (Leviticus 19:23)This is what is written “And I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind.” (Kohelet 2:5) Doesn’t all humanity plant anything which they desire?! Whatever a man plants in the earth it produces, whether pepper or anything else – if a man plants it, it grows! Rather, people do not know the proper place for each particular plant. But Shlomo, who was wise, planted all manner of trees [as it says “And I made for myself gardens and orchards, and planted in them fruit trees of every kind”]. R’ Yannai said that Shlomo even planted pepper plants, and how did he plant them?! Shlomo was wise and knew the essential foundation of the world. From where? “From Tzion the sum of all (miclal) beauty Gd appears...” (Tehillim 50:2), from Tzion which completed (nishtaclal) the whole world. Why is it called the Foundation Stone? Because the whole world was founded from it. Shlomo knew which ligament extended to Kush and planted pepper on it, and it produced immediately, just as he said “and I planted in them trees of every kind.” Another explanation: “and I planted in them fruit trees of every kind…” Just as the navel is placed in the middle of a man, so is the Land of Israel the navel of the world, as it says “those who sit on the center of the land (Ezekiel 38:12). The land of Israel sits in the middle of the world, and Jerusalem in the middle of the land of Israel, and the Temple in the middle of Jerusalem, and the palace in the middle of the Temple, and the ark in the middle of the palace and the Foundation stone before the palace from which the world was founded. Shlomo, who was wise, understood the roots that went out from it to the whole world and planted on them all types of trees, and therefore he said – I made for myself gardens and orchards."

Therefore, it was given in the desert. Another reason it was given in the desert: Just like the desert is not planted and worked, so to is it with the one who accepts Torah upon himself. The yoke of rulership and the yoke of the ways of the world are removed from him. And just like the desert doesn't incur agricultural taxes, so to, men of Torah are are free men in this world. Another interpretation: Who fulfills the Torah? He who makes himself like a desert and detaches himself from everything.  ",

                "(7) \"And they came near the daughters of Zelophehad.\" (Numbers 27:1) -  During this generation women were fencing in that on which men were breaking down fences. Thus you find Aaron told them, \"Break off the gold rings\" (Exodus 32:2), and the women did not want to and they protested against their husbands, as it says, \"and all the nation broke off the golden rings which were in their ears\" (Exodus 32:3), and women did not participate in the incident of the calf.  And so too, in the incident of the spies, [the women] did not participate \"and when [the spies] returned, they caused all the congregation to murmur against [Moses]\" (Numbers 14:36), and they decreed a decree, as they said, \"we can not go up\" (Numbers 13:31), but the women were not in agreement with them, just as is written above regarding the matter: \"because God had said of them: 'they will surely die in the wilderness' and there was not left of them a man\" (Numbers 26:65) - \"a man\" and not a woman, for they did not want to enter to the Land, but the women became close by seeking a portion in the Land. And thus this episode was written next to [the death of Miriam], from which the men broke down fences and women erected fences. ",

From whom should you learn? From Yiftach. What is written about him? “…and he was the son of a harlot…” (Shoftim 11:1) R’ Shimon ben Gamliel said that she brought her sister-wife into her house, and our Rabbis say that she was really a harlot, and because there was some levity in him all of the people fell upon him. Therefore it is written ‘you shall beware of everything evil’ and ‘If there is among you a man who is unclean…’ These are Israel who became impure through idolatry, as it says “…scatter them afar like a menstruant; 'Go out,' say to it.” (Yeshayahu 30:22) “…he shall go outside the camp…” (Devarim 23:11) that they were exiled to Bavel. “And it shall be, towards evening…”(Devarim 23:12) the evening of the kingdoms, and the Holy One purifies them as it says “…he shall bathe in water…” (ibid.) and it is written “When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion…” (Yeshayahu 4:4) “…and when the sun sets…” (Devraim 23:12) When the King Messiah comes of whom it is written “…and his throne is like the sun before Me.” (Tehillim 89:37) “…he may come within the camp” (Devarim 23:12) These are Israel, entering intp the Holy Temple. “And you shall have a designated place outside the camp…” (Devarim 23:13) this is the merit of Avraham. R’ Pinchas said- “…so that you can go out there,” to Bavel. “And you shall keep a stake in addition to your weapons…” (Devarim 23:14) Nevuchadnezar demanded that they serve an idol and they said “…let it be known to you, O king, that we will not worship your god…” (Daniel 3:18) “…and you shall return and cover your excrement.” (Devarim 23:14) The covering of idolatry that was in Jerusalem. “For the Lord, your God, goes along in the midst of your camp…” (Devarim 23:15) The Holy One will be revealed to them immediately and saved them from the fire. “Therefore, your camp shall be holy…” (ibid.)
