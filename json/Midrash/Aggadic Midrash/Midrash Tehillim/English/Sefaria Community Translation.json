For of sacrifices [Scripture] says: \"that it may be pleasing (nirtzah) in his behalf, to atone for him.\" (Lev. 1:4) And of chastisements it is written: \"as a father is pleased with (yirtzeh) the son.\" (Prov. 3:12) Another interpretation: Chastisements are to be loved, because they are more pleasing than sacrifices. Sin offerings and guilt offerings atone only for that [particular] transgression, as it is said: \"that it may be pleasing (nirtzah) in his behalf, to atone for him.\" (Lev. 1:4) But chastisements atone for all [sins]. That is, H' has chastised me greatly [for all my sins, so my atonement is complete].", 
            "Open for me the gates of righteousness. In the next world [He] says to a person: What was your occupation? And he says: I fed the hungry. They say to him: Th[ere] is the gate of one who feeds the hungry; enter it. Another says: I gave water to the thirsty; and they say to him: Th[ere] is the gate of one who gives water to the thirsty; enter it. And the same for one who clothes the naked, and one who raises orphans and one who is charitable; and so with all the mitzvot. David said: I did all of the[se things]; open all of them for me. Therefore he says: Open for me the gates of righteousness so that I may enter them."
