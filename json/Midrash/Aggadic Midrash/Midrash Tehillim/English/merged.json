            "“For, behold, the wicked bend the bow…” (Tehillim 11:2) R’ Berachia said in the name of R’ Aba that this is referring to Shevna and Yoach who wrote a letter, fastened it to an arrow and shot it out through a window to Sancheriv. They wrote on it ‘Hezekiah and Isaiah will not allow us to make peace with you. “…that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart” (ibid.) at the two upright in heart, Hezekiah and Isaiah. ", 
            "“For when the foundations are destroyed; what has the righteous man done?” (Tehillim 11:3) If the wicked arose and destroyed the righteous who founded your world, as it is written “and the righteous is the base of the world,” (Mishle 10:25) Righteous of the World (the Holy One) – what work have they left for You in Your world? If the wicked arose and destroyed the foundation stone, from which the world was begun, You oh Righteous One of the world, what benefit is left for You in Your world or Your works? And if the wicked arose and destroyed the foundations  which precede the deeps, Righteous one of the world – what work have You achieved?"

            "... Another version. The Rabbis said the minimum number that the word ‘stones’ can refer to is two, and Yaakov woke up in the morning and found that they were one. He was in great fear and said ‘the house of the Holy One is in this place and I was not conscious of His Presence’ as it says “And he was afraid and said, How dreadful is this place! This is no other than the house of Gd…” (Bereshit 28:17) From here they said that anyone who prays in Jerusalem is as if they pray before the Throne of Glory, because the gate of heaven is there; and an open door to hear prayer, as it says “…and this is the gate of heaven. (ibid.) Yaakov went back to gather the stones and he found that they were one stone. Yaakov took the stone and placed it as a monument in the midst of the place and oil descended from heaven for him and he pour it out on the stone, as it says “…and he poured oil on top of it.” (Bereshit 28:18) What did the Holy One do? He took its right foot, sank it to the deepest depths and made it a keystone for the earth, like a man who places a keystone in an arch. Therefore it is called foundation stone, because there is the navel of the world and from there the world was opened out. And upon it is the palace of Gd, as it says “And this stone, which I have placed as a monument, shall be a house of God…” (Bereshit 28:22) And Yaakov fell to the ground before the foundation stone, praying before the Holy One, and said ‘Master of the World! If you bring me back to this place in peace, then I will sacrifice before you whole offerings and thanksgiving offerings!’ as it says, “And Jacob uttered a vow, saying…” (Bereshit 28:20) He vowed and he fulfilled is vow. From there he picked up his feet (to go) and there he left the well, because the well had been going before him, and in the blink of an eye came to Haran as it says, [“Now Jacob lifted his feet…” (Bereshit 29:10] “And Jacob left Be’er Sheva, and he went to Haran.” (Bereshit 28:10) About him the tradition says, “When you walk, your step will not be constrained, and if you run, you will not stumble.” (Mishle 4:12) R’ Abahu said in the name of R’ Yochanan – the angels carried him as it says, “On [their] hands they will bear you…” (Tehillim 91:12) Ya’akov’s steps were not constrained and his strength did not falter and like a mighty man he rolled back the stone from off of the mouth of the well. Then the well rose up and overflowed and the shepherds were astounded because all together they were unable to roll off the stone and he did it alone as it says, “…that Jacob drew near and rolled the rock off…” (Bereshit 29:10)"
