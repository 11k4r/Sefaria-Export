                "It was said before Abraham was born. Nimrod was a heretic concerning the truth of the lord blessed be he.  He was conceited and he said that he himself was a God. And the people of his time served and bowed to him. He was so - an established king, and he was wise and he saw in the wisdom of the stars that there will be one man born in his time that will oppose him and deny him from his faith and he will be victorious over him. And he [Nimrod] trembled with a great fear. What did he do? He sent after his lesser officers and he told them this matter. He consulted them about what to do concerning this future child that will come. They advised him \"we agree on the following: that you will build a great palace and place guards in the opening and declare among your kingdom that every woman that they pass through and come there after ...[unknown]... if it's a son, you will slaughter him on her womb and if it's a daughter, it will live and you will give gifts to the mother and dress her in royal garments and they will call before her. Such will be done to a mother of a daughter. When Nimrod hear their advice, he was greatly gladdened much so. He declared in all the countries of his kingdom that there will come all the nations to build a great palace for the king 60 ama high, 80 ama long. After it was completed, he declared that all the women shall come and pass through the house and remain there until they gave birth. He commanded officials to bring them there. ...[unknown]... He decreed that the born son will be slaughtered on the chest of the mother and if a daughter, the mother was dressed in clothing of fine linens and silks colorfully embroidered and she will go out from there and they will give her much honor. So commanded King Nimrod and they left the house with honor."

                "\"I lost the three shepherds in one month\" (Zecharia 11:8); and thus, in one month, Aaron, Miriam, and Moses died. Miriam died on the 1st of the month of Nisan, and the well closed up; and in the second of Nissan, Aaron's sons died; On the first of Av, Aaron died, and the clouds of glory dissipated; On the seventh of Adar Moses our teacher, and God's servant, died. Even though they didn't all die in the same month, it's considered as if it were one month. Each had a gift that they gave to the Israelites. By the merit of Miriam, God gave the well, by the merit of Aaron, the clouds of glory, By the merit of Moses, the Mana. When Miriam died, the well closed so the Israelites could see that it was by her merit that God granted them the well. Moses and Aaron bewailed her internally, and the Israelites did so publicly. Moses didn't know about the Israelites mourning until after six hours, when the Israelites came to them and said: \"how long will you sit and mourn?\" He said to them \"should I not continue to mourn my sister who has died.\" \"They said to him: \"just as you mourn for one soul, all the more so mourn for all of us.\" He said to them: \"why\" They said to him \"because we do not have water to drink.\" He stood and went and saw that there was no water in the well, and he began to argue with them, he said:\"did I not say to you that I can't carry this people on my own, did I not appoint for you officers for the thousands, and officers for the hundreds, and the fifties, and the twenties, I gave you officials, and chiefs, and great elders, and they are to busy themselves with your problems.\" They said to him: \"Everything is on you, for you are the one who brought us out of Egypt and brought us to this terrible place, if you give us water, everything will be fine, but if you don't, then we will stone you.\" When Moses heard this, he fled from them and went into the tent of meeting. God said to him \"Moses what is going on?\" Moses said before the Master of the World: \"your children want to stone me, and were I not to have fled, I would have already been stoned to death.\" God said said: \"how long will will you speak ill of my children, was it not enough for you that I told you at Horeb, just a little more and they will stone you. Now go and pass before them and see whether they will actually stone you, and it is said the Torah: \"God said to Moses, pass before the people.\" Moses went first and his cohort after him, and Moses didn't know which rock God had intended to give to them for bringing out water. The Israelites found a rock that was dripping, and they stood upon it. When Moses saw them standing on it, he turned around and said to God \"how long will you put our lives at risk?\" He said to them, \"until I bring water out of the rock.\" The Israelites said: \"give us water so that we can drink!\" Moses responded to them \"How long will you continue to rebel? Does a creation rebel against its creator? As such, you are rebelling against God. Moses said:  \"God wants to give you water.\" The Israelites said: \"you are the prophet who shepherds us in the dessert and now you say you don't know which rock God intends you to bring water out of? Moses and Aaron gathered the people around a different rock, as it says in the Torah \"Moses and Aaron gathered the community at the face of the rock.\" Moses said to himself: \"If I command the rock to bring out water and it doesn't, I'll be embarrassed before the community, and they will say to me, 'Moses, where is your alleged wisdom.'\" At the very same moment Moses told the Israelites, \"you know that God can do miracles for you,  and you know that miracles are beyond me. For when the knowledge of man is divinely inspired, it is not his own knowledge or wisdom. Moses brought down his staff upon the back of the rock, and he did so himself, as he spoke to the israelites , as it says in the Torah \"from this rock, we will bring you water.\" The rock began to fill itself to bring out water, and when Moses saw it, he lifted his arm again and struck the rock, as it says in the Torah \"he hit the rock twice with his staff.\" This time though, blood came out, as it says in the Psalms, \"yes, he hit the rock and the waters flowed (Psalm 78:20).\"  It's a flow of blood, as we see from the laws of menstruation \"when a woman has a discharge of blood (Leviticus 15:25).\" Moses came and said to God \"the rock isn't bringing out water, only blood.\" God said to the rock: \"why are you only bringing out blood, and not water?\" The rock said \"Master of the Universe, why did Moses hit me?\" God then asked Moses, \"why did you hit the rock?\" Moses responded: \"In order to bring out water.\" God said: \"Did I tell you to hit the rock? Did I not tell you to speak to it with words?\" Moses responded: \"I did speak to it, but nothing came out!\" God responded \"did you not command all of Israel \"in justice you shall judge your people (Leviticus 19)? Thus, why didn't you judge the rock with justice? This is how I raised you in Egypt, as it says in scripture 'God fed him honey from the rock,  (Deuteronomy 32:13).' It befits you to lead, and thus  say to my children \"listen you rebels!\" Don't read \"rebels\" rather \"idiots\" shotim (also a hominem for drinkers). They are idiots, and you have your eyes open. A nation of idiots will not enter the land of Israel, as it says in the Torah \"you will not bring this community . . .\" Therefore God said to Moses, \"tell the rock to turn it's blood into water.\" It is thus written in scripture: \"who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flinty rock into a spring (Psalm 114:8).\" (Note this is a Psalm recited during Hallel on Rosh Chodesh, the beginning of the month). When they reached the beginning of the month, God said to Moses, \"your time has come to an end.\" Moses said before him, \"please God, let it not be soon.\" \"It is tomorrow\" responded God, thus Moses was distressed all day, for he didn't know when exactly his death would come. ...",
                "Go now, and return to Aaron and tell him that the time has come for him to depart this world. It is also the time for all those who are at least 50 years old who you led for the duration of the Exodus. Get up, it is the time for the seventy elders, and those with the officials of Israel shall come with Eliezer and Aaron, and they shall gather at Moses's tent, and they asked about his welfare, and after that they will go to the Tent of Meeting. This is the order in which they should go: Moses in the middle, Aaron to his right, Eliezer to his left, and the Elders on either side, and all of Israel behind them, and then all of them should enter the Tent of Meeting. Aaron should sit to the right of Moses, who will sit at the head. Eliezer will be at his left and the officers behind them. And you will say to him: \"God decrees that Moses and Aaron will die.\" And God said to Moses: \"my servant Moses, in every part of my house you were faithful, you have been a great speaker, and but there is a great request that I must ask of you, and it's hard for me to ask. Moses asked: \"What's the request?\" God said: \"You need to gather your brother unto his people (bury your brother), for he will not enter the land that I have given to the Israelites, those who rebelled against my commandments at Merivah. Moses said: \"God, all is known and clear to you and your holy throne, for you are master of the world, and all of your creations that you created in this world, and by your hand they came to be, and by your hand you will do that which you will, but it is not apparent to me how you could ask me to tell my brother that he is going to die. My brother is greater than me, and how can I speak to him and tell him to go up to the mountain of Hor where he will die.\" God responded to Moses: \" do not tell him with words, rather take Aaron and Eliezer his son and bring them to the mountain of Hor, and there you will go up with them and speak to him softly and gently, but also in a way that he will understand what's going on. When the three of you are on the mountain, strip Aaron of his clothes, and dress Eliezer his son in them, and Aaron will be gathered unto his people, and die there. ",
                "When Moses heard this, he was deeply troubled in his heart, and he didn't know what to do. He cried a great and mighty cry, until it was time was time to deliver the news to his brother Aaron that he would die. Moses was steadfast to act, and went with this brother Aaron to tell him of the matter. He went to the Tent of Meeting and found Aaron there. That very day, Moses taught the custom: sit and cry only until the crowing of the rooster. Moses called Elieer and said to him: \" go and get the elders and the officers, for God has told me of an important matter. They came and gathered at the tent of Aaron. Aaron stood and found Moses standing. Aaron said to Moses: \"my brother, why have you taught us this custom today?\" He said to him: God is revealing something that I must tell you.\" He said to him: \"Speak!\" He responded, \"not until we leave here.\" Moses stood and dressed Aaron with the eight vestiges of the priestly clothing within Aaron's tent. After that he left. Therefore it was added as a custom that day that one should sit and cry only until the crowing of the rooster.\" Aaron was placed in the along with Moses; to their right was Joshua, to their left, the elders. The officers were both here and there, and all of Israel was behind them. Because the Israelites saw Aaron with the same respect as Moses, they rejoiced a great rejoicing, and said that \"Aaron is ascending farther toward the spirit of God. Because they loved him, they all came out  after him, and when they arrived at the tent of meeting, Aaron requested to enter the tent, but Moses wouldn't let him. Moses said to him: \"Let's go outside of the camp, for that is the intended direction.\" Aaron said to him: \"tell me what did God say to you?\" Moses responded: \"I'll tell you once we get to the mountain.\" Moses commanded the people (just as he did at Sinai, and just as Abraham did his lads on the way to Moriyah) stay here until we return to you, me, Aaron and Eliezer will go up to the top of the mountain, we will hear the word of God, and then we will return. The three of them went up. Moses wanted to say something to Aaron, but didn't know how, and didn't know what to say. Moses finally said: \"Aaron my brother, what are the appointed things that that God has given you?\" He responded: \"These\" He said: \"What?\" Aaron said: \"God has given me the altar, the table, upon which sits the bread of welcoming.\" Moses responded: \"These are the things that God has appointed to your hand, but now, God has something that he is asking of you.\" \"What is it\" Aaron asked? \"God has given you a light,\" said Moses. Aaron asked: \"What are you talking about, god has given more more than just a single light, God has given me seven (the lights of the menorah), and they are currently lit in the Tent of Meeting. Moses gave Aaron the sense that he was talking in parable, and that the candle of which he was referring, was really Aaron's soul. As it says in scripture: \"the soul of man is the light of God (Proverbs 20:27).\" Moses saw that Aaron still didn't understand the parable. He said to him \"in truth, you are called simple,\" as it says in scripture: \"and of Levi it is said, your Urim and Tumim (being read here is your light and your simpleness) are for a man of your faith.\" Immediatly, the cave opened at its mouth. Moses said: \"Aaron my brother, enter the cave.\" Aaron responded \"ok,\" and Moses request to strip Aaron of his clothing. Is it possible that when he stripped his clothing, he died naked, and was buried naked? God forbid! Rather, every high priest wears eight of the priestly garments, but the lower priests wear four. Aaron wore, eight, and Eliezer wore four. Moses only took four of Moses's clothes from Aaron and gave them to Eliezer to make him the high priest. Aaron still remained with four vestiges of clothing. They said to Eliezer, wait here until we leave, and Aaron and Moses entered. They saw a made bed and a set table with a menorah lit, and the angels of God standing on either side. Aaron said to Moses: \" my brother, how long will you hide from me what God has told you? You know that For you know that although God speaks to you first, God's mouth testifies on my behalf. Even now he is setting out to meet you, and he will be happy to see you. Why do you conceal the matter which the Holy One entrusted to you?even if it is about my death, I will accept it with joy. Moses said to him: \"Since you mentioned the subject of death, I will confirm your suspicion, and say that it is a matter of death which he spoke to me. I was afraid, however, to inform you of it. Your death is not like that of anyone else, for the ministering angels have come to carry you away. Aaron said to him: \"My brother Moses, why didn't you tell me in the presence of my Maker, my wife, and my children?\" Moses answered: \" My brother, do you not know that it is forty years since you made the calf and that you deserved to be killed then, but I stood in prayer and supplication before God, and God saved you from death, as it is written: \"Moreover, God was angry enough with Aaron to have destroyed him; so I also interceded (Deuteronomy 9:20). Is my death then going to be like your death? For when you die, you will have me to bury you, but when I die, I will not have my brother to bury me. When you die, your sons inherit your station, but when I die others will inherit my honor.\" Thus he comforted him with his words. "

Each tower was a hundred amot [about 180 feet] deep and a hundred amot wide.  As soon as Korach found one of these towers, he became proud of his wealth.  Another one was found by Antiochus, and the third is hidden for the World to Come.  The origin of Korach's dispute was a widow who had a single ewe.  When she came to shear it [for the first time], Aharon heard and took the wool.  She went to Korach and wept before him, telling him, \"This and this has Aharon done to me.\"  Korach came by Aharon and said to him, \"What have you done by this widow, to take her wool?\"  Aharon said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the premier-part of the shearing of your sheep you are to give him' (Dev 18:4).\"  So Korach took four silver [coins] and gave [them] to her.  The days [passed] and the ewe gave birth to its first-born.  Aharon heard and took the lamb.  She went and wept before Korach.  Korach said to Aharon, \"What is it for you and for this widow, to take the son of the ewe?\"  He said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'every firstling that is born in your flock and in your herd, the male-one, you are to hallow to ha-Shem your God' (Dev 15:19).\"  Korach went to him, full of anger.  When the widow saw this, she sent and slaughtered the ewe.  Aharon heard, and came and book the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach.  Korach said to him, \"What is it for you, by this widow?\"  He said to him, \"They are mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the priest is to be given the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach' (Dev 18:3).\"  When the widow saw this, she stood and specially-devoted the meat.  Aharon heard and took the meat.  Korach said to him, \"It wasn't enough, everything that you took from her?  Now even the meat?\"  He said to him, \"It is mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'everything specially-devoted in Israel -- it is for you' (Bam 18:14, Parshat Korach).\"  He [Korach] said to him [Moshe], \"Why have you, son of Amram, established authority over us, and been raised up over us?\"  Moshe said to him, \"Unto the morrow, judgement.\"  In the morning, Korach had gathered to him 250 men with [fire-]pans and smoking-incense.  Immediately Moshe stood before the Holy One of Blessing and said, \"Multiplier of Universes, is this prophecy you have sent me true?\"  Ha-Shem replied to him, \"It is true.  And now you will see what I will do to Korach, and why his name is called Korach.  For in his days, there will be made baldness in Israel.\"  Immediately the Holy One of Blessing instructed the ground and it swallowed them [Korach and his followers] up to their navels.  Korach cried out and said, \"Moshe!  Have mercy on us!\"  Moshe said to them, \"'Too much is yours, Sons of Levi!' (Bam 15:7).\"  Immediately they were swallowed up [by the earth], and the rest were burned up [by fire].  Those that were swallowed [by the earth] reasoned that they would never rise up [again].  Until Hannah came and prophesied for them, as it [the song of Hannah] says, 'ha-Shem brings death and gives life, lowers to Sheol and raises up (Shmuel I 2:6).'  But in all this they didn't believe, until the Beit ha-Mikdash destroyed.  [For the earth] swallowed the gates of the Beit ha-Mikdash, and they [the gates] came by Korach and he grabbed hold of them.  They [Korach and his followers] said, \"When these gates rise up, so too we will be brought up with them.\"  [ed. Jellinek: And they were appointed the guardians, or, those who carried out the observances, over the gates until they rise up.]  Therefore we say, 'Let not the rich person glorify themselves with their wealth,' for all wealth belongs to the Holy One of Blessing.  As it says, 'Mine is the silver and mine is the gold -- the word of ha-Shem, Master of Legions (Hag 2:8).  And it says, 'One who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor (Mish 21:21).'"

His wealth was so much the more so, wondrous and vast. Where did he get all this money? From the money that Yosef the Righteous had collected in Egypt [in return for distributing the stored grain during the seven years of famine], which had filled three towers. Each tower was a hundred amot [about 180 feet] deep, a hundred amot wide, and one hundred amot inside. Yosef gave them all to the house of Pharaoh, and did not give his children even five silver [coins]. For what reason? Because he proceeded faithfully, as it says (Ber 47:14), \"Yosef brought the silver into Pharaoh's house.\" When Korach found one of these towers, he became proud of his wealth. Another one was found by Antoninus, and the third is hidden for the World to Come.  What was the origin of Korach's dispute with Moshe and with Aharon? It was for the sake of a particular widow who had a single ewe. When she came to shear it [for the first time], Aharon heard and took the wool. She went to Korach and cried out and wept, telling him, \"This and this has Aharon done to me.\" Korach came by Aharon and said to him, \"What is it with you and this widow, that poor woman?

When the widow saw this, she went and slaughtered the ewe. Aharon heard, and came and took the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach. Korach said to him, \"What is it with you and this widow?\" He said to him, \"They are mine according to the Torah, for as it says, 'the priest is to be given the shankbone, the jawbone, and the rough-stomach' (Dev 18:3).\" And Korach went, full of anger. When the widow saw this, she stood and made an oath, saying the meat of this ewe is set-aside for me. Aharon heard and took all the meat, as it says, 'everything specially-devoted in Israel -- it is for you' (Bam 18:14, Parshat Korach).\"  He [Korach] said to him [Moshe], \"Why should you, son of Amram, establish authority over us?\" [not in ed. Jellinek: 'Should you pluck out the eyes of these men, we will not come up.' They said this verse specifically against Moshe and Aharon.] Moshe said to him, \"To the morrow, judgement.\" In the morning, Korach had gathered to him 250 men (and alongside Moshe and Aharon, all the prophets), these with their fire pans, these offering sacrifices and these burning incense. Immediately Moshe Rabbeinu stood in prayer before ha-Shem and said, \"Multiplier of Universes, is this prophecy you have sent us true?\" Ha-Shem replied to him, \"It is true. And you will see what I will do to Korach.\" This is why he was named Korach -- for in his days, 'a void was created in Israel' (Sanhedrin 109b).  Moshe said further before the Holy One of Blessing, \"If these die as all people do, if their lot be the common fate of all humanity, ha-Shem did not send me (Bam 16:29).\" The Holy One of Blessing said to Moshe, \"You have rejected a major principle of faith\" (Passover Haggadah, Maggid, Four Children; and Yer. Sanhedrin 10:1, 50a). Moshe said before the Holy One of Blessing, \"Multiplier of Universes, 'if ha-Shem creates a new creation...' (Bam 16:30). The Holy One of Blessing said to him, \"I will do according to your will.\"  Immediately the Holy One of Blessing hinted to the ground and it swallowed them [Korach and his followers] up to their navels. Korach and all his household cried out and said, \"Moshe! Moshe! Have mercy on us!\" Moshe said to them, \"'Too much is yours, Sons of Levi!' (Bam 16:7).\" Immediately they were swallowed up [by the earth], and the rest were burned up [by fire], as it says, 'so they went down, they and all theirs, alive, into Sheol; the earth covered them (Bam 16:33).' And it is written, 'fire went out from before the presence of ha-Shem and consumed the fifty and two hundred men, those who had brought-near the incense.'  Those that descended below the earth remained there. And they reasoned that they would never rise up [again]. Until Hannah came and prophesied for them, as it [the song of Hannah] says, 'ha-Shem brings death and gives life, lowers to Sheol and raises up' (Shmuel I 2:6). But with all this, they didn't believe that they would rise again, until the Beit ha-Mikdash was destroyed and the gates of the Beit ha-Mikdash were swallowed up, as it says, 'her gates have sunk into the ground' (Eichah 2:9). They [the gates] came by Korach and he grabbed hold of them. Immediately they believed and said, \"When these gates rise up, so too will we rise up with them.\" And they were appointed the guardians [or, those who carried out the observances] over those gates until they rise up.  Thus was Korach and his wealth obliterated from among the community. Therefore it says, 'Do not praise the wealthy for their wealth,' for all wealth belongs to the Holy One of Blessing. As it says, 'Mine is the silver and mine is the gold -- the word of ha-Shem, Master of Legions' (Hag 2:8). [ed. Jellinek: And it says, 'One who pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor' (Mish 21:21).]  "

                "\"The angels who are in charge of healing are Sanoy, Sansenoy and Semangelof. While God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is not good for man to be alone' (Genesis 2:18). He also created a woman, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air. Adam stood in prayer before his Creator: 'Sovereign of the universe!' he said, 'the woman you gave me has run away.' At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels to bring her back.\"Said the Holy One to Adam, 'If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.' The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, 'We shall drown you in the sea.'\"'Leave me!' she said. 'I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.' \"When the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: 'Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.\""

                "It is written: \"Who can stand before His wrath? Who can resist His fury?\" (Nahum 1:6). Rabbi Zeira opened [the discussion of Gehinnom with the verse]: \"The leech has two daughters, 'Give!' and 'Give!'\" (Proverbs 30:15). Said Rabbi Eliezer: Two walls of angels stand at the entrance of Gehinnom, and they say \"Give! Give! Bring! Bring!\" And why is its name Gehinnom? Because the sound of its groaning (from the Hebrew root NHM) goes from one end of the world to its other end. And why is its name Taphteh? Because all enter there through the temptation (from the Hebrew root PTH) of the evil inclination.",
                "Chapter 1: Rabbi Yochanan opened: \"Those who pass through the valley of weeping (alluding to Gehinnom) turn it into a water spring; moreover, the early rain covers it with blessings.\" (Psalms 84:7). This teaches that the evil person confesses like the leper (who has to cover his upper lip) confesses, and says \"I am so-and-so, son of so-and-so. I committed such-and-such sin in such-and-such place on such-and-such day in front of so-and-so in such-and-such and such-and-such gathering. There are three gates (reading שערים as per mss.) in Gehinnom, one in the sea, one in the wilderness, and one in settled land. From where is the one in the sea? As it is said: \"From the belly of Sheol (another name for Gehinnom) I cried out, And You heard my voice.\" (Jonah 2:3). From where is the one in the wilderness? As it is said: \"They went down [with all that belonged to them] alive into Sheol...\" (Numbers 16:33). From where is the one in settled land? As it is said: \"Declares the LORD, who has a fire in Zion, Who has an oven in Jerusalem.\" (Isaiah 31:9). There are five types of fire in Gehinnom: Fire that eats and drinks, that drinks and doesn't eat, that eats and doesn't drink, that doesn't eat and doesn't drink, and there is fire that eats fire. There are burning coals the size of mountains in it, and there are burning coals the size of hills in it. There are burning coals the size of the Dead Sea in it, and there are burning coals the size of large stones in it. There are rivers of pitch and sulfur in it, dragging and boiling hot coals of broom-wood. The sentence of an evil person: Angels of destruction push him so that he falls on his face and others receive him from them and push him in front of the fire of Gehinnom, and it opens its mouth wide and swallows him, as it is said: \"Assuredly, Sheol has opened wide its gullet And parted its jaws in a measureless gape; And down into it shall go, That splendor and tumult, That din and revelry.\" (ibid. 5:14), to the one who doesn't have a single positive action that tilts him to the side of merit, but one who has in his hand Torah and good deeds and great afflictions come upon him is saved from the judgement of Gehinnom, as it is said: \"Though I walk through a valley of deepest darkness, I fear no harm... Your rod and Your staff—they comfort me.\" (Psalms 23:4). \"Your rod,\" those are the afflictions, \"and Your staff,\" that is the Torah.",
                "Chapter 2: Rabbi Yochanan opened: \"But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall have no way to flee, and their hope shall be the drooping of the soul.\" (Job 11:20), a body that isn't destroyed and its soul leaves in a fire that doesn't extinguish, and about them the scripture says: \"For their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched.\" (Isaiah 66:24). Said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: One time, I walked on the road and I found Elijah the Prophet, his memory for blessing. He said to me: Is it your desire that I place you at the gate of Gehinnom? I said to him: Yes. He showed me humans that were hanging by their noses and humans that were hanging by their hands and humans that were hanging by their tongues and humans that were hanging by their legs, and he showed me women that were hanging by their chests, and he showed me humans that were hanging by their eyes, and he showed me humans to whom they were feeding their flesh and humans to whom they were feeding hot coals of broom-wood and humans sitting alive and worms were eating them. He said to me: These are the ones that about them it is written \"For their worm shall not die.\" (ibid.). And he showed me humans to whom they were feeding fine sand, and they were feeding them against their will and their teeth were breaking, and the Holy One Blessed Is He was saying to them: Evil ones, when you ate stolen [food], it was sweet in your mouths, and now there isn't within you the strength to eat, to fulfill that which is said: \"You break the teeth of the wicked.\" (Psalms 3:8). And he showed me humans whom they were casting from the fire to the snow and from the snow to the fire like this shepherd who shepherds his sheep from mountain to mountain, and about them the scripture says: \"Sheeplike they head for Sheol, with Death as their shepherd. The upright shall rule over them at daybreak, and their form shall waste away in Sheol till its nobility be gone.\" (ibid. 49:15). Said Rabbi Yochanan: Each individual angel is appointed to exact the punishment of one sin. This one comes and judges him and goes on his way, and so the second one and so the third one and so all of them until they recompense for all the sins that are in his hand. To what is the matter similar? To a debtor who had many creditors and they brought him before the king. Said to them the king: What should I do for you? Go and split it (his money) between yourselves. [So too] at that time, his soul is passed in Gehinnom to cruel angels and they split it between themselves.",
                "Chapter 3: It is stated: Three go down to Gehinnom and don't go up: The one who has an affair with someone's wife and the one who whitens the face (embarrasses) of his friend in public and the one who swears falsely in the name of God, and some say even the one who is honored through the dishonor of his friend and the one who causes friction between a man and his wife to bring strife between them. On every Sabbath eve, they bring them to two snowy mountains and leave them there, and at the Sabbath's departure, they return them to their places, and an angel goes out and pushes them and returns them to their places in Gehinnom. And from them (the mountains) they take snow and put it beneath their underarms in order to cool them during the six weekdays, and the Holy One Blessed Is He says to them: Evil ones, Woe to you that even in Gehinnom you are stealing, as it is said: \"May drought and heat snatch away their snow waters, And Sheol, those who have sinned.\" (Job 24:19, read homiletically as they will snatch away snow waters), as if to say: even in Sheol they sinned.",
                "Chapter 4: Every twelve months they (the evil ones) are made into ashes and the wind scatters them under the feet of the righteous, as it is written: \"And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet.\" (Malachi 3:21), and after that, their souls return into them and they go out from Gehinnom and their faces are black like the bottom of a pot and they affirm the righteousness of the judgement over them and say: You have sentenced us properly, You have judged us properly. Lord, righteousness is Yours, but we are shamefaced, as of this day. But the nations of the world, the worshipers of foreign worship, they judge them in seven pyres of fire and in every individual pyre [they are judged for] twelve months. And the River of Fire goes out from under the Throne of Glory and descends on them and goes from one end of the world to its other end. And there are seven pyres in Gehinnom (reading בגיהנם as per mss.)  (In the Midrash Rut HaNe'elam they detailed the seven pyres. See Zohar Chadash: 33, and see also Zohar: Terumah: 150b that there is a place in Gehinnom that is called boiling excrement ..., also in Midrash Tehillim 11:6), and in each individual pyre there are six thousand houses, and in each individual house there are six thousand windows, and in each individual window there are six thousand jugs of bitterness, and all of them are prepared for the scribes and for the judges that did not act reasonably, and concerning that time Solomon said: \"And in the end you roar, When your flesh and body are consumed...\" (Proverbs 5:11), and not one of them escapes, unless there is Torah and good deeds in him. After all of this, the Holy One Blessed Is He has mercy on His creations, as it is said: \"For I will not always contend, I will not be angry forever: Nay, I who make spirits flag, Also create the breath of life.\" (Isaiah 57:16).",

They said, Come let renew upon them decrees until they have forsaken their God, and they will believe in our foreign worship. They stood up and decreed: Any Israelite who makes a latch or bolt on his door will be stabbed with they sword. (What was the reason for this [decree]? [It was] in order that there should not be honor and privacy in Israel, because any house that does not have a door has no honor or privacy. And any who wants to enter can enter whether day or night.) Since Israel saw this, they got up and removed all doors of their houses. They were unable to eat, drink or have relations, because of thieves, robbers, and Greek invaders. They did not sleep day or night. The verse was fulfilled upon them, \"You will be afraid night and day\" (Deuteronomy 28:66). They said before The Holy One Blessed is He (THOBH), Master of the world how much are we able to carry? He said to them, [This decree is] with the sin of Mezuzzah, but even so room was found in this decree. Israel was living without doors, and there is nothing that removes the evils of a wife from upon her husband like a door. As it says \"Go my people, come into your rooms etc.\" (Isaiah 26:20) They endured the decree for three years. When the Greeks saw that Israel endured the decree and no one violated it in any way, they stood up and decreed another decree. They spread a rumor: Any person from Israel who has an ox or sheep, he should inscribe on its horns that it has no portion in the God of Israel. (What was the reason for this [decree]? In order that Israel would not eat meat, milk, or cheese, and they would not be able to plow.) They said we know that they cannot endure this decree. When Israel heard this they were pained a great pain. They said O mercy! that we will be atoned with our God. They stood up and sold their animals whether pure or impure, and Israel was traveling on foot. Upon them [the verse] was fulfilled, \"I have seen slaves on horseback etc.\" (Ecclesiastes 10:7) THOBH said to them, [This decree is] with the sin that you withheld yourselves from ascending to Jerusalem on the three pilgrimage festivals, bringing the sacrifices, and giving the priestly gifts. Therefore [the verse] is fulfilled upon you \"Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes\" (Deuteronomy 28:31) But even so room was found in this decree. The deer, the rams and all species of pure birds were coming into and entering the houses of Israel, because they did not have doors. Israel came and grabbed them and slaughtered and ate meat. They gave praise to THOBH and they said, Blessed is he that flipped the intentions of our enemies for good. Because if their houses had doors, how could all game enter to them. THOBH answered them, You were meciful on my honor and you did not deny me, So I have prepared for you game. When the Greeks saw that Israel endured this decree, they stood up and decreed: Anyone whose wife goes to immerse herself, he will be stabbed with the sword. And the one who catches her [going to immerse] will have her as a wife and her children as slaves. When Israel saw this they refrained from having relations. When they Greeks heard this they said, since Israel is not using their beds, we will attach ourselves to them [beds]. When Israel saw this, they returned to their wives without immersion, [because] they were forced to. They said, Master of the world we are forced [to have relations] without immersion. "

                "When Moses ascended on high, a cloud came up against him, and Moses our teacher did not know if one rides it or holds it. Immediately, the cloud opened its mouth and Moses entered it, and he walked into the firmament like a man walking on land, as it is written in the Torah: \"And Moses entered within the cloud\" [Exodus 24:18].He encountered Kemu'el, the guardian angel in charge of the twelve thousand angels of destruction who were standing at the gates of the firmament. He rebuked Moses, saying to him: \"What do you have, son of Amram, that you should come into the place of the Fiery Angels?\" Moses said to him: \"I did not come merely by myself, but only with the permission of the Holy One, Blessed be He, to receive the Torah and bring it down to Israel. Since he would not let him pass, Moses hit him with one hit, and he made him lost from the world. And Moses continued walking in the firmament until he confronted the angel Hadraniel. They said about the angel Hadraniel that he is taller than his kinsman -- six-hundred thousand parasangs [tall] -- and with each and every word that comes out of his mouth, twelve thousand bolts of fire come out of his mouth (all at once). And when he saw Moses he rebuked him, saying, \"What do you have, son of Amram, in the place of the highest holiness?\" When Moses heard his voice, Moses became afraid before him. And his eyes were dripping tears and he wanted to be let down from the cloud. Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He's mercy was aroused, and He said to Hadraniel, \"From the day I created you (all), you (all) have been an opponent of theirs [the humans]. In the beginning, when I wanted to created Adam the First, you (all) made their prosecution before me, and you (all) said to me, 'What is man that You are mindful of him?' [Psalms 8:5] And I was upset with you (all), and I burnt from you (all) many bunches with my little finger. And now you (all) are quarreling with my loyal servant, whom I brought up here to receive the Torah and to bring down to my chosen child? If it were not for the Torah that Israel is receiving, you (all) would not have a living space in the firmament!\" When Hadraniel heard this, immediately he hastened himself before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and said before him, \"Master of the Universe, it is revealed and known before you, but I did not know that he [Moses] came with your permission. Now I shall be his emissary and go before him as a student before his teacher.\" At once, Hadraniel ran and lowered himself before Moses as a student before his teacher, until they arrived at Sandalphon's fire. Hadraniel said to Moses, \"You must return, for I am not able to protect myself before Sandalphon's fire that it should not burn me.\" When Moses saw Sandalphon, he was immediately startled and hastened to go down from the cloud, and his eyes were dripping tears, and he asked for mercy before the Holy One, Blessed be He. And He answered him. Out of his great fondness for Israel, the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself descended from His Throne of Glory and stood before Moses until he passed from Sandalphon's fire. About that time it was written in the Torah: \"And YHWH passed before him\" [Exodus 34:6]. They said about Sandalphon that he was taller than his kinsman, the distance of five-hundred years, and about him it is written: \"One of the Ophanim on the ground, next to the Chayot\" [Ezekiel 1:15] -- this is Sandalphon, who stands behind the Chariot and ties crowns for its owner.Does it cross your mind that the ministering angels know where the Holy One, Blessed be He, dwells, for is it not written, \"Blessed is YHWH's glory from His place [mimkomo]\" [Ezekiel 3:12]? However, it does not say \"in His place\" [bimkomo] but rather \"from His place\" [mekomo], which teaches that the place of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not known. But Sandalphon completes the crown that crowns the place of the Holy One, Blessed be He, with sanctity. And the crown rises from its own accord and sits on the head of its master. Immediately, all the legions on high are afraid and trembling, and the chayot are silent, and the holy seraphim roar like lions, and the seraphim call out, \"Holy, holy, holy, YHWH of legions, the whole earth is filled with His glory\" [Isaiah 6:3]. And this is its interpretation: holy in the upper [world]; holy in the lower [world]; holy, the eternal YHWH, who is sanctified in the foundations of the legions of Israel. And at the time when the crown reaches the Throne of Glory, immediately the wheels of the chariot start rolling, and the Lord shakes his footstool and all the heavens are shaken. And at the time when the crown passes over the Throne of Glory to sit in its place, all the legions on high open their mouths and they say, \"Blessed is YHWH's glory from His place\" [Ezekiel 3:12]. Come and see the praise of the Holy One, Blessed be He: that when the crown arrives at His head, YHWH holds His head to receive the crown from His servants. And all the chayot and seraphim and the wheels of the chariot and the Throne of Glory and the legions of the heavens and the chashmalim and the cherubim, elevate themselves and unite and give majesty and splendor, and they proclaim, and they say in one voice: \"YHWH is king, YHWH was king, YHWH will be king forever and ever.\" And this is its interpretation: YHWH, the King before the creation of the world; YHWH, the King from the creation of the world; YHWH will reign forever and until the world to come. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, Blessed be His name, consents, and says: \"YHWH shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations, hallelujah\" [Psalm 146:10]. And when Moses passed by Sandalphon, he encountered Regyon, which is the river of fire. And in its burnings the ministering angels are immersing and renewing themselves every morning, as it says: \"They are renewed every morning—great is Your faithfulness\" [Lamentations 3:23], and so it is interpreted through Daniel [7:10]: \"A river of fire streamed forth before Him; a thousand thousands served Him; myriads upon myriads attended Him; the court sat and the books were opened.\" And this is its interpretation: \"river of fire\" -- this is called Regyon, which flows with burning embers, and it goes out before the the Throne of Glory of the Holy One, Blessed be He. And it is made with the sweat of the four chayot beneath the Throne of Glory. And they sweat fire in awe of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and from the fiery sweat, that river is made. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, sits on the Throne of Judgement and judges even the ministering angels, as it says: \"If He cannot trust His own servants, and casts reproach on His angels\" [Job 4:18]. And it is written: \"He puts no trust in His holy ones; the heavens are not guiltless in His sight\" [Job 15:15]. And when the ministering angels are brought to judgment, they renew themselves in that river of fire. Therefore, if the ministering angels were immersing in the river of fire, would not humans also be doing so? Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, sent it [the river of fire] away, and he [Moses] came upon Galizur, called Raziel, about whom it is said, \"Is it not at the word of the Most High, that evil and good emanate?\" [Lamentations 3:39] And why is his name Galizur? Because he reveals [gala] the taste of rock [tzur]. And why is his name Raziel? Because he is one who hears behind the curtain [ragod] what is decreed [gazer] to be, and he proclaims it in the world. And Elijah, who should be recalled for good, stands on Mount Horeb, and he hears the voice of the proclamation from His mouth, and he makes heard the voice in the world. As it is written: \"For a bird of the air may carry the utterance\" [Ecclesiastes 10:20] -- this is Raziel; \"and a winged creature may report the word\" [Ecclesiastes 10:20] -- this is Elijah.It is said about Galizur [Raziel] that he stands in front of the throne with his wings spread to receive the noxious breath from the mouth of the chayot, otherwise, all the ministering angels would be burned from the noxious breath of the chayot. And another vocation is said about Galizur: that he takes like an iron pan, which is made of fire, burning embers in the river Regyon, and he stands opposite the kings and ministers, leaders of the world, so that there luster should prevail and their awe befall the world. When Moses saw him, he trembled. Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, took him and removed him from there. He [Moses] encountered a regiment of Angels of Terror, who surround the Throne of Glory, those who are mighty of all the angels. And they wanted to burn him with the noxious breath of their mouths. Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, spread the luster of his glory and said to Moses: \"Give them an answer.\" Moses our teacher said to them: \"It is written in the Torah, 'I am the Lord your God Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage' [Exodus 20:2]; perhaps you were enslaved in Egypt and went forth as free people, that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'You shall have no other Gods' [Exodus 20:3]; perhaps there is idol worship amongst you and you are in need the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not swear' [Exodus 20:7]; perhaps there are dealings amongst you that you are in need of the Torah regarding oaths? It is written: 'Remember the Sabbath day and sanctify it' [Exodus 20:8]; perhaps there is activity amongst you that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'Honor your father and mother' [Exodus 20:12]; perhaps you have a father and mother that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not murder' [Exodus 20:13]; perhaps there is bloodshed amongst you that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not commit adultery' [Exodus 20:13]; perhaps there are women amongst you that you need the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not steal' [Exodus 20:13]; perhaps there are finances in the firmament that you are in need of the Torah? It is written, \"You shall not bear [false witness]' [Exodus 20:13]; perhaps there are false testimonies amongst you that you are in need of the Torah? It is written: 'You shall not covet' [Exodus 20:14]; perhaps there are houses and fields and vineyards amongst you that you are in need of the Torah?\" Immediately, all the ministering angels retracted [their desire to burn Moses] and they admitted to his words to the Holy One, Blessed be He. And they said: \"YHWH, our Master, 'How majestic is Your name throughout the earth, you who have covered the heavens with Your splendor!'\" [Psalm 8:2] And He, the Holy One, Blessed be He, taught him [Moses] the whole Torah in forty days. And when he [Moses] came to descend [from the firmament] and saw the awesomeness of the angels, and the legions of awesome angels -- trembling [zia] angels, and shuddering [chalchala] angels, and quaking [ratat] angels --  immediately, shuddering [chalchala] took hold of him and he forgot it [the Torah] all at one moment. Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, called to Yefefiah, Minister of Torah, who gave over to him [Moses] the Torah, fully prepared and preserved. And all the ministering angels became his [Moses's] admirer. And each one of them gave him something of healing and the hidden meaning of names that comes out of each and every section of Torah [parsha] and all their uses, as it says, \"You went up to the heights, having taken captives, having received tribute of men\" [Psalm 68:19]. And even the Angel of Death gave him something, as it is written: \"He places the incense and made expiation for the people\" [Numbers 17:12]. And this is the honorable use of that which was taught to him by Yefefiah, the Minister of Torah, and by Metatron, Minister of the Faces. And Moses gave it over to Elazar, and Elazar to his son Pinchas, who is Elijah the great and precious priest, he should be remembered for good. Amen."

                "<b>I) But [the children of] Benjamin would not yield</b> (Judges 20:13). The word <i> the children of </i> is missing, for they did an abomination, disgrace, and lewd act in Israel, and they deserve to have their descent from the righteous Benjamin retracted, and to separate them from his generations and inclusions, and they did not call them <i>children of Benjamin</i> for they did not yield to listen to their brothers, and in the remainder of places where they are called <i>children of Benjamin</i> it gave them hope and a path of repentance that they may turn from their evil deeds and repent and be called as their brothers' names the children of Benjamin.",
                "<b>II) On his way to restore his monument at the River [Euphrates]</b> (II Samuel 8:3). It is written lacking in the book of Samuel, for this verse is mentioned in two places — in Samuel and Chronicles (I Chronicles 18:3), and the verse is said in two times and regarding two occasions (matters). Firstly it says <i>to restore his monument at the river,</i> and secondly <i>to set up his monument at the river Euphrates.</i> Though it is not the business of the first time to make known if it is the Euphrates or the Nile, it was written elsewhere, so <i> Euphrates </i> is read.",
                "<b>III) Like when [a man] asks of the word</b> (II Samuel 17:23). The word <i>man</i> is removed from within the verse, for a human is removed from God, and thus it says (Psalms 8:6) <i> You have removed him slightly from God </i>, and his word will not come about like the word of God, thus the word <i>man</i> is removed from within the verse and suspended on the verse from the margin. If he had been meritorious in his deeds and done them for the sake of Heaven, his advice would be as the word of God.",
                "<b>IV) Because [thus] the king's son is dead</b> (II Samuel 18:20). The word <i>thus</i> is lacking, because of the evil of his deeds, for he sought to kill his father and cover up the matter, and came to fornicate with his father's concubines. Though Joab said <i>because thus the king's son is dead,</i> the word <i>thus</i> is suspended on the margin, because the king's son was killed for his wrongs, but <i>thus</i> can mean <i>right</i> as in <i>rightly have the daughters of Ẓelopheḥad spoken</i> (Numbers 27:7) or <i>\"what you are saying is right.\"</i> (Genesis 44:10).",
                "<b>V) And Adrammelekh and Śaretser [his sons] struck him down with the sword</b> (II Kings 19:37). What is written within, but not read on the margin: <i>And Adrammelekh and Śaretser struck him down.</i> But that does not let us know who had struck him down, whether their sons or others, so <i>his sons</i> is suspended on the margins  to let all those on earth know the vengeance of God against him, and to fulfill regarding him <i>Behold I will raise a great evil against you from your own house</i> (II Samuel 12:11).",
                "<b>VI) The zeal of the LORD</b> (II Kings 19:31) is written, but a continuation of <i>of Hosts</i> is suspended to it in the margin, for great vengeance the LORD did against him first, but after that by the hands of the hosts of His angels. And thus it says <i>And an angel of God came out and struck the camp of Assyria, a hundred and eighty-five thousand</i> (II Kings 19:35), thus it is suspended outside to make known both of the vengeances that God avenged.",
                "<b>VII) Behold days are [coming], declares the LORD</b> (Jeremiah 31:38) It is written lacking: <i>For behold days are, declares the LORD</i>. This is an obscure matter, and we could say that this is tidings for far-off times and many days, just as we read <i>coming</i> from the margin, bringing near the end-times and bringing near the tidings of reading <i>coming</i> in the commandments of the prophet. May the Merciful One accelerate the end-times.",
                "<b>VIII) Let there be [for her] no escape</b> (Jeremiah 50:29), it is written wwithin lacking, for Babylon is the seat of sovereignty and the house of royalty, and thus it says (Daniel 4:27) <i>Is that not great Babylon, which I built to be a royal residence?</i> And in it the kingdom of Israel sank and her kingdom was annulled, and Jeremiah told the remnant of Israel that the vengeance of Adonai would be avenged upon it in this world and in the future, so it is written <i>Let there be no escape</i> in this world, and continued on the margins <i>Let there be no escape <b>for her</b></i> in the future.",
                "<b>IX) All that you say [to me] I will do</b> (Ruth 3:5) From the way this is written, it can be determined that Naomi commanded Ruth two times: the first time Ruth said <i>all that you say I will do,</i> and on the second command she said <i>all that you say <b>to me</b> I will do</i>, so it was suspended on the margin.",
