            "... R’ Meir said: there was a single pearl suspended in the belly of the fish which gave light for Yona like the sun at its strength in the midday and Yona could see everything that was in the sea and the deeps as it says, “A light is sown for the righteous…” (Tehillim 97:11) The fish said to Yona, ‘don’t you know that my day has come to be fed into the mouth of Leviathan?’ He replied, ‘take me to him and I will save you and myself from his mouth.’ He brought him to Leviathan and he (Yona) said to him, ‘Leviathan! For your sake I descended, to see your dwelling place in the sea and further more I am prepared to come down and place a rope in your tongue and to bring you up to the great feast of the righteous. He showed him the seal of Avraham (saying) ‘look at the sign of the covenant!’ Leviathan saw Yona and fled before him two days journey. He (Yona) said to it (the fish), ‘behold, I saved you from the mouth of Leviathan! Now show me what is in the sea and the deeps. It showed him the great river of the waters of the ocean as it says, “…and a river surrounded me…” (Yona 2:4) It showed him the paths of the Red Sea through which Israel passed as it says, “…the weeds were wrapped about my head.” (Yona 2:6) It showed him the place from which the breakers and waves of the sea come forth as it says, “…all Your breakers and waves passed over me.” (Yona 2:4) It showed him the pillars of the earth on their base as it says, “…the earth with her bars closed on me forever…” (Yona 2:7) It showed him the lowest part of the netherworld as it says, “…yet you have brought up my life from the pit…” (ibid.) It showed him Gehinnom as it says, “…out of the belly of She’ol I cried…” (Yona 2:3) It showed him underneath the palace of Gd as it says, “I went down to the bottom of the mountains…” (Yona 2:7) From here we learn that Jerusalem stands on seven mountains. And he saw there the foundation stone fixed in the deeps, and he saw there also the sons of Korach standing and praying for it. They said to Yona, ‘behold, you are standing under the palace of Gd – pray and you will be answered immediately!’ He said to the fish, ‘stop where you are because I want to say a prayer.’ The fish stopped and Yona began to pray before the Holy One saying, ‘Master of all the worlds! The One who is called bringer of death and giver of life! Behold, my soul has arrived at death – give me life! He was not answered until the following came out of his mouth, ‘that which I vowed I will fulfill! My vow to bring up Leviathan and to prepare him before you I will fulfill on the day of Israel’s salvation as it says, “But I will sacrifice to You with a voice of thanksgiving…” (Yona 2:10)  Immediately the Holy One gestured to the fish and it vomited Yona up onto the dry land as it says, “And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Yona…” (Yona 2:11) And the sailors saw all the signs, miracles and great wonders that the Holy One did with Yona and they arose and cast aside each one his gods as it says, “They that guard lying vanities forsake their loyalty.” (Yona 2:9) They returned to Yafo, went up to Jerusalem and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins as it says, “Then the men feared the Lord greatly and offered a sacrifice to the Lord…” (Yona 1:16)  And did they actually offer sacrifice?! Rather this refers to the blood of the covenant of circumcision which is like the blood of sacrifice. Then each one vowed to bring his children and all he had to the Gd of Yona. They vowed and fulfilled and because of them one calls converts righteous converts."
