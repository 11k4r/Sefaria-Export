            "The sons of Hyrkanos said to their father: Get thee rip to Jerusalem and vow that thy son Eliezer should not enjoy any of thy possessions. He went up to Jerusalem to disinherit him, and it happened that a festival was being celebrated there by R. Jochanan ben Zakkai. All the magnates of the district were dining with him ; (such as) Ben Zizith Hakkeseth,- Nicodemus ben Gorion, and Ben Kalba S'bu. Why was his name called Ben Zizith Hakkeseth? Because he reclined at table in a higher position than the other magnates of Jerusalem. Concerning Nicodemus ben Gorion, people said that he had (stored) provisions containing 3 S'ah of fine flour for every inhabitant of Jerusalem. When the  zealots' arose and burnt all the storehouses, they measured and found that he had had provisions for three years for every inhabitant in Jerusalem. Concerning Ben Kalba S'bu'a it was told that he had a house measuring 4 Kors with roofs covered with gold. The people said (to R. Jochanan) : Behold, the father of R. Eliezer has arrived. He bade them saying : Prepare a place for him, and seat him next to us. (R. Jochanan) fixed his gaze on R. Eliezer, saying to him,' Tell us some words of the Torah. (R. Eliezer) answered him saying : Rabbi! I will tell thee a parable. To what is the matter like? To this well which cannot yield more water than the amount which it has drawn (from the earth); likewise am I unable to speak words of the Torah in excess of what I have received from thee. (R. Jochanan) said to him, I will (also) tell thee a parable. To what is the matter like? To this fountain which is bubbling and sending forth its water, and it is able to effect a discharge more powerful than what it secretes  in like manner art thou able to speak words of the Torah in excess of what Moses received at Sinai. (R. Jochanan) continued: Lest thou shouldst feel ashamed on my account, behold I will arise and go away from thee. Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai arose and went outside. (Thereupon) R. Eliezer sat down and expounded. His face shone like the light of the sun and his effulgence beamed forth like that of Moses, so that no one knew whether it was day or night. They went and said to Rabban Jochanan ben Zakkai: Come and see R. Eliezer sitting and expounding, his face shining like the light of the sun and his effulgence beaming like that of Moses, so that no one knows whether it be day or night. He came from (his place) behind him and kissed him on his head, saying to him : Happy are ye, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because this one has come forth from your loins. Hyrkanos his father said : To whom does (R. Jochanan) speak thus ? The people answered : To Eliezer thy son. He said to them : (R. Jochanan) should not have spoken in that manner, but (in this wise), \" Happy am I because he has come forth from my loins.\" Whilst R. Eliezer was sitting and expounding, his father was standing upon his feet. When (Eliezer) saw his father standing upon his feet, he became agitated and said to him : My father ! be seated, for I cannot utter the words of the Torah when thou art standing on thy feet. (Hyrkanos) replied to him : My son, it was not for this reason that I came, but my intention was to disinherit thee. Now that I have come and I have witnessed all this praise ; behold thy brothers are disinherited and their portion is given to thee as a gift. (Eliezer) replied : Verily I am not equal to one of them. If I had asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for land, it would be possible for Him to give this to me, as it is said, \" The earth is the Lord's, and the fidness thereof\" (Ps. xxiv. 1). Had I asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for silver and gold, He could have given them to me, as it is said, \" The silver is mine, and the gold is mine \" (Hag. ii. 8). But I asked the Holy One, blessed be He, that I might be worthy (to learn the) Torah only, as it is said, \" Therefore I esteem all precepts concerning all things to be right ; and I hate every false way \" (Ps. cxix. 128).

            "R. Eliezer BEN Hyrkanos opened (his discourse with the text), \"Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord, or shew forth all his praise?\" (Ps. cvi. 2). Is there any man who can utter the mighty acts of the Holy One, blessed be He, or who can shew forth all His praise?' Not even the ministering angels are able to narrate (the Divine praise). But to investigate a part of His mighty deeds with reference to what He has done, and what He will do in the future (is permissible), so that His name should be exalted among His creatures, whom He has created, from one end of the world to the other, as it is said, \"One generation to another shall laud thy works\" (ibid. cxlv. 4). Before the world was created, the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Name - alone existed, and the thought arose in Him to create the world. He began to trace (the foundations of) the world before Himself, but it would not stand. They told a parable. To what is the matter like? To a king who wishes to build a palace for himself. If he had not traced in the earth its foundations, its exits and its entrances, he does not begin to build. Likewise the Holy One, blessed be He, was tracing (the plans of) the world before Himself, but it did not remain standing until He created repentance. Seven things were created before the world was created. They are : The Torah, Gehinnom, the Garden of Eden, the Throne of Glory, the Temple, Repentance, and the Name of the Messiah. Whence do we know that this applies to the Torah? Because it is said, \"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old\" (Prov. viii. 22). \"Of old\" means before the world was created. Whence do we know this with regard to the Garden of Eden ? Because it is said, \"And the Lord God planted a garden of old\" (Gen. ii. 8). \"Of old,\" whilst as yet the world had not been created. Whence do we know this with reference to the Throne of Glory? Because it is said, \" Thy throne is established of old\" (Ps. xciii. 2). \"Of old,\" whilst as yet the world had not been created. Whence do we know this with regard to the Temple? Because it is said, \"A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary\" (Jer, xvii. 12). \"From the beginning,\" whilst as yet the world had not been created. Whence do we know  that Repentance (was premundanc)? Because it is said, \"Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the Earth and the world\" (ibid. xc. 2); and then in close proximity (we read), \"Thou turncst man to contrition\" (ibid. 3). \"Before,\" i.e. before the world was created. Whence we do know that the name of the Messiah (was premundane)? Because it is said, \"His name shall endure for ever; before the sun Yinnonwas his name\" (Ps. Ixxii. 17). \"Yinnon,\" before the world had been created. Another verse says, \" But thou, Bethlehem Ephrathah, which art to be least among the thousands of Judah, from thee shall he come forth unto me who is to be ruler over Israel ; whose ancestry belongs to the past, even to the days of old '\" \" (Mic. v. 2). \" The past,\" ^ whilst as yet the world had not been created. Porthwith \" the Holy One, blessed be He, took counsel with the Torah whose name is Tushijah (Stability or Wisdom) with reference to the creation of the world. (The Torah) replied and said to Him : Sovereign of the worlds! if there be no host for the king and if there be no camp for the king, over Avhom does he rule? If there be no people to praise the king, where is the honour of the king? The Holy One, blessed be He, heard this and it pleased Him. The Torah spake : The Holy One, blessed be He, took counsel with me concerning the creation of the world, as it is said, \"Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge; I am understanding; I have might\" (Prov. viii. 14). Hence they say. Every government which has no counsellors is not a proper government. Whence do Ave know this? From the government of the House of David which employed counsellors, as it is said, \"And Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe\" (1 Chron. xxvii. 32). If the government of the House of David had counsellors, how much more so should other people act likewise. This is of benefit to them, as it is said, \"But he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise\" (Prov. xii. 15), and (Scripture) says, \"But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety\" (ibid. xi. 14)."

            ".......Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, forty days did Moshe spend on the mountain - he read the doctrine of Scripture during the day and reviewed the doctrine of Scripture at night. And after forty days, he took the tablets and went down to the camp, and on the seventeenth of Tammuz he broke the tablets and killed the scorners of Israel. And he spent forty days in the camp, until he he burned the [golden] calf and ground it down like the dust of the earth, and killed all those who kissed the calf he expunged idol worship from Israel; and he set every tribe up in its place. And on Rosh Chodesh (the beginning of the month of) Elul, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (Exodus 24:12), \"go up to Me to the mountain.\" And they blew the <i>shofar</i> (rams's horn) in the camp - since behold, Moshe went up to the mountain - such that they not err again after the worship of idols. And the Holy One, blessed be He, was exalted on that day with that <i>shofar</i> [blast], as it is stated (Psalms 47:6), \"God is exalted by the <i>shofar</i>.\" And therefore, the Sages, ordained that we should blow the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh Chodesh Elul in each and every year...."
