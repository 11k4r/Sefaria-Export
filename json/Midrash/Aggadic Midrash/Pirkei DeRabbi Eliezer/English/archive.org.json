            "The eighth trial (was as follows) : \" And when Abram was ninety-nine years old \" (Gen. xvii. 1), the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him : Until now thou hast not been perfect before Me ; but circumcise the flesh of thy foreskin, and \" walk before me, and be thou perfect\" - (ibid.). Moreover, the foreskin is a reproach, as it is said, \" For that is a reproach unto us \" {ibid, xxxiv. 14), because the foreskin is more unclean than all unclean things, as it is said, \" For henceforth there shall no more || come into thee the uncir- cumcised and the unclean \" (Isa. lii. 1). For the foreskin is a blemish above all blemishes. Circumcise the flesh of thy foreskin and be perfect. Rabban Gamaliel said : Abraham sent and called for Shem, the son of Noah, and he circumcised the flesh of the foreskin of our father Abraham, and the flesh of the fore- skin of Ishmael his son, as it is said, \" In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son \" (Gen. xvii. 26). \" In the selfsame day \" (means) in the might of the sun at midday. Not only that, but (it indicates) the tenth day of the month, the Day of Atonement. It is written in connection with the Day of Atonement, \" Ye shall do no manner of work on that selfsame day, for it is a day of atonement \" (Lev. xxiii. 28) ; and in the present instance the text says, \" In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised \" (Gen. xvii, 26). Know then that on the Day of Atonement Abraham our father was circumcised. Every year the Holy One, blessed be He, sees the blood of our father Abraham's circumcision, and He forgives all the sins of Israel, as it is said, \" For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you \" (Lev. xvi. 30). In that place where Abraham was circumcised and his blood remained, there the altar was built,* and therefore, \" And all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar \" {ibid. iv. 30). (It says also), \" I said unto thee. In thy blood, live ; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, live \" (Ezek. xvi. 6). Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa said : All who are circumcised have (excessive) pain on the third day, as it is said, \" And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore \" (Gen. xxxiv. 25). They may wash || the child on the third day, when it happens to fall on the Sabbath, and all things necessary for a circumcision are permitted to be done on the Sabbath.  Every uncircumcised (man) shall not eat (of the Paschal offering), and shall not touch the sanctuary. He who separates himself from circumcision is like one separated from the Holy One, blessed be He. Rabban Gamaliel, the son of Rabbi Jehudah the Prince, said : When our father Abraham was circumcised, on the third day he was very sore,- in order to test him. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do ? He pierced one hole in the midst of Gehinnom, and He made the day hot, like the day of the wicked. He went forth, and sat down at the entrance of the tent in the cool of the day, as it is said, \" And he sat at the tent door (in the heat of the day) \" {ibid. xviii. 1). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the minister- ing angels : Come ye, let us descend and visit the sick, for the virtue of visiting the sick is great before Me. The Holy One, blessed be He, and the angels descended to visit our father Abraham, as it is said, \" And the Lord appeared unto him \" (ibid.). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the ministering angels : Come ye and see ye the power of circumcision.** Before Abraham was circumcised he felP on his face (before Me), and afterwards I spake with him, as it is said, \" And Abraham fell upon his face \" (ibid. xvii. 17). Now that he is circumcised he sits and I stand. Whence do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, was standing ? Because it is said, \" And he looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him \" [ibid, xviii. 2). Rabbi Ze'era || said : There are five kinds of Orlah (things iincircumcised) in the world : four with reference to man, and one concerning trees. Whence do we know this con- cerning the four (terms) applying to man ? (Namely,) the uncircumcision of the ear, the uncircumcision of the lips, the uncircumcision of the heart, and the uncircumcision of the flesh. Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the ear ? Because it is said, \" Behold, their ear is uncircum- cised \" (Jer. vi. 10). Whence do we know of the vmcircum- cision of the lips ? Because it is said, \" For I am of un- circumcised lips \" (Ex. vi. 12). Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the heart ? Because it is said, \" Circumcise the foreskin of your heart \" (Deut. x. 16) ; and (the text) says, \" For all the nations are uneircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uneircumcised in heart \" (Jer. ix. 26). Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the flesh ? Because it is said, \" And the uneircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin \" (Gen. xvii. 14). And \" all the nations are uneircumcised \" in all the four cases, and \" all the house of Israel are uneir- cumcised in heart.\" The uncircumcision of the heart does not suffer Israel to do the will of their Creator. And in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will take away from Israel the uncircumcision of the heart, and they will not harden their stubborn (heart) any more before their Creator, as it is said, \" And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh \" (Ezek. xxxvi. 26) ; and it is said, \" And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin \" (Gen. xvii. 11). Whence do we know concerning the one ('Orlah) for trees ? * Because it is said, \" And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision : three years shall they be as vuicircumcised unto you \" (Lev. xix. 23). Rabbi Ze'era taught : The tree || which is mentioned here is none other than the vine tree. If they do not cut off from the tree the fruit of the first three years, all the fruit which it yields will be gleanings fit to be pluckt off, and not good ; and its wine will be disqualified for the altar ; but if they cut off from the tree the fruit of the first three years, all the fruit which it yields will be good for the sight, and their wine will be selected to be brought upon the altar. So with our father Abraham ; before he was circumcised, the fruit which he produced was not good [in its effects, and was disqualified from the altar; but when he had been circumcised, the fruit which he produced was good in its effects, and his wine] was chosen to be put upon the altar like wine for a libation, as it is said, \" And wine for the drink offering \" (Num. xv. 5). Rabbi said : Abraham did not delay aught with reference to all (things) which He commanded him, as it is said, \" And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised \" (Gen. xvii. 12) ; and when Isaac was born, (and when) he was eight days old (Abraham) brought him to be circumcised, as it is said, \" And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old \" {ibid. xxi. 4). Hence thou mayest learn that everyone who brings his son for circumcision is as though (he were) a high priest bringing his meal offering and his drink offering upon the top of the altar. Hence the sages said : A man is bound to make festivities and a banquet on that day when he has the merit of having his son 1 circumcised, Hke Abraham our father, who circumcised his son, as it is said, \" And Abraham circumcised l| his son Isaac \" - (ibid.). Rabbi Jochanan said : All heathens who come to Israel are circumcised by their own freewill and with their consent, and in the fear of Heaven are they circumcised. We do not believe a proselyte until seven generations (have passed), so that the waters should not return to their source. But slaves arc circumcised both by their freewill and with their consent as well as without their consent, and no confidence is placed in slaves. Likewise with all the slaves who were circumcised with our father Abraham, they did not remain true (converts) in Israel, neither they nor their seed, because it is said, \" All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised mth him \" {ibid. xvii. 27). Why did he cir- cumcise them ? Because of purity, so that they should not defile their masters with their food and with their drink, for whosoever eateth with an uncircumcised person is as though he were eating flesh of abomination. All who bathe ^vith the uncircumcised are as though they bathed with carrion, and all who touch an uncircumcised person are as though they touched the dead, for in their lifetime they are like (the) dead ; and in their death they are like the carrion of the beast, and their prayer does not come before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, \" The dead praise not the Lord \" (Ps. cxv. 17). But Israel who are circumcised, their prayer comes before the Holy One, blessed be He, || like a sweet savour, as it is said, \" But we will bless the Lord - from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord \" {ibid. 18). Rabbi said : Isaac circumcised Jacob, and Esau ; and Esau despised the covenant of circumcision just as he despised the birthright, as it is said, \" So Esau despised his birthright \" (Gen. xxv. 34). Jacob clung to the covenant of circumcision, and circumcised his sons and his grandsons. Whence (do we know) that the sons of Jacob were circum- cised ? Because it is said, \" Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us . . . if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.\" {ibid, xxxiv. 22). Another text says, \" Only on this con- dition will we consent unto you : if ye will be as we be \" {ibid. 15). Hence thou canst learn that the sons of Jacob were circumcised. The sons of Jacob circumcised their sons and their grandsons. They gave it to them as an inheritance for an everlasting statute, until Pharaoh the Wicked arose ® and decreed harsh laws concerning them, and withheld from them the covenant of circumcision. And on the day when the children of Israel went forth from Egypt all the people were circumcised, both young and old, as it is said, \" For all the people that came out were circumcised \" (Josh. v. 5). The Israelites took the blood of the covenant of circum- cision, and they put (it) - upon the lintel of their houses, and when the Holy One, blessed be He, passed over to plague the Egyptians, He saw the blood of the covenant of circum- cision upon the lintel of their houses and the blood of the Paschal lamb. He was filled || with compassion on Israel, as it is said, \" And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy (twofold) blood,* I said unto thee. In thy (twofold) blood, live ; yea, I said unto thee. In thy (two- fold) blood, live \" (Ezek. xvi. 6). \" In thy blood \" is not written here, but in \" thy (twofold) blood,\" with twofold blood, the blood of the covenant of circumcision and the blood of the Paschal lamb ; therefore it is said, \" I said unto thee, In thy (twofold) blood, live ; yea, I said unto thee. In thy (twofold) blood, live \" (ibid.). Rabbi Eliezer said : Why did the text say twice, \" I said unto thee. In thy blood, live ; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, hve \" ? But the Holy One, blessed be He, said : By the merit of the blood of the covenant of circum- cision and the blood of the Paschal lamb ye shall be redeemed from Egypt, and by the merit of the covenant of circum- cision and by the merit of the covenant of the Passover in the future ye shall be redeemed at the end of the fourth kingdom ; therefore it is said, \" I said unto thee, In ", 
            "thy blood, live ; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, live \" {ibid.). There are three afflictions, (namely,) the affliction of the fast, the affliction of the prison, and the affliction of the road.3 Whence do we know of the affliction of the fast ? (Because it is said,) \" I afflicted my soul with fasting \" (Ps. XXXV. 13). Whence do we know of the affliction of the prison ? (Because it is said,) * \" They hurt his feet with fetters \" (ibid. cv. 18). Whence do we know of the affliction of the road ? (Because it is said,) \" He weakened my strength in the way \" {ibid. cii. 23). On account of the affliction of the road, (the children of Israel) did not circumcise, and when they went forth from Egypt all the people were circumcised, both young and old, as it is said, \" For all the people that came out were circumcised \" || (Josh. V. 5). Rabbi Ishmael said : Did the uncircumcised hear the voice of the Holy One, blessed be He, on Mount Sinai, saying, \" I am the Lord thy God \" (Ex. xx. 2) ? ' They were circumcised, but not according to its regulation. They had cut off the foreskin, but they had not uncovered the corona. Everyone who has been circumcised, but has not had the corona uncovered, is as though he had not been circumcised, therefore the text says, \" Israel was not circumcised of old.\" When they came to the land (of Canaan),i the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Joshua : Joshua ! Dost thou not know that the Israelites are not circumcised according to the proper regulation ? He again circumcised them a second time, as it is said, \" The Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint,! and circumcise again the children of Israel a second time \" (Josh. V. 2). \" And Joshua made him knives of flint \" {ibid. 3), and he gathered all the foreskins until he made them (as high) as a hill, as it is said, \" And he circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins \" (ibid.). The Israelites took the foreskin and the blood - and covered them with the dust of the wilderness. When Balaam came, he saw all the wilderness filled with the foreskins of the Israelites, he said : Who will be able to arise by the merit of the blood of the covenant of this circumcision, which is covered by the dust ? as it is said, \" Who can count the dust of Jacob ? \" (Num. xxiii. 10). Hence || the sages instituted that they should cover the foreskin and the blood with the dust of the earth, because they are compared to the dust of the earth, as it is said, \" And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth \" (Gen. xxviii. 14). Thus the Israelites were wont to circumcise until they were divided into two kingdoms. The kingdom of Ephraim cast off from themselves the covenant of circum- cision. Elijah, may he be remembered for good, arose and was zealous with a mighty passion, and he adjured the heavens to send down neither dew nor rain upon the earth. Jezebel heard (thereof), and sought to slay him. Elijah arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him : \" Art thou better than thy fathers ? \" Esau sought to slay Jacob, but he fled before him/ as it is said, \" And Jacob fled into the field of Aram \" (Hos. xii. 12). Pharaoh sought to slay- Moses, who fled before him and he was saved, as it is said, \" Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay- Moses. And Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh \" (Ex. ii. 15). Saul sought to slay David, who fled before him and was saved, as it is said, \" If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou shalt be slain \" (1 Sam. xix. 11).* Another text says, \" And David fled and escaped \" {ibid. 18). Learn that everyone, who flees, is saved. Elijah, may he be remembered for good, arose and fled from the land of Israel, |] and he betook himself to Mount Horeb, as it is said, \" And he arose, and did eat and drink \" (1 Kings xix. 8). There the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed unto him, and He said to him : \" What doest thou here, Elijah ? \" {ibid. 9). He answered Him, saying : \" I have been very zealous\" {ibid. 10). (The Holy One, blessed be) He, said to him : Thou art always zealous ! \" Thou wast zealous in Shittim on account of the im- morality. Because it is said, \" Phineas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,^\" turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was zealous with my zeal among them\" (Num. xxv. 11). Here also art thou zealous. By thy life ! They  shall not observe the covenant of circumcision until thou seest it (done) with thine eyes. Hence the sages instituted (the custom) that people should have a seat of honour for the Messenger of the Covenant; for Elijah, may he be remembered for good, is called the Messenger of the Covenant, as it is said, \" And the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he Cometh \" (Mai. iii. 1). \" O God of Israel ! Hasten and bring the Messiah in our lifetime to comfort us, and may he restore our hearts, as it is said : ' And he shall restore ^ the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to the fathers ' \" (Mai. iv. 6)."
