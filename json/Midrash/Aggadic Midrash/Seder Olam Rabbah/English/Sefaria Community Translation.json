                "From Adam to the Flood was 1656 years, and this is  their enumeration: Adam 130, Seth 105, Enosh 90, Kenan  70, Mahalalel 65, Jared 162, Enoch 65,  Methuselah 187, Lamech 182, and Noah was six hundred years old, etc.\" (Genesis 7, 6). Enoch buried Adam, and lived after him 57 years. Methuselah exhausted his days just before the Flood. From the Flood to the division [of languages] was 340 years. Noah lived ten years after the division [of languages]. Our father Abraham was at the division [of languages] 48 years old. Rabbi Yosei said: Eber was so great a prophet that he called the name of his son Peleg by the Holy Spirit."
