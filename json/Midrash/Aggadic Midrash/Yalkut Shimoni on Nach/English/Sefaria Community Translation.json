            "..[With regard to] this did [Jeremiah] say to have it written, 'Surely the shepherd boys will drag away [the evil ones, Edom or Babylonia in defeat].' (Jeremiah 49:20, 50:45) Rabbi Samuel son of Nachmani said, 'We have a tradition in our hands that Esau [i.e., evildoers, identified with Esau, Edom, and Babylonia] will not fall except into the hands of [the tribal descendants of] Rachel's children [i.e., Joseph or Benjamin]. Why? Because if the [other] tribes were to bring suit against Esau, saying, 'Why did you pursue your brother [our ancestor Israel to harm him (see e.g., Genesis 27:41)]? [We, Israel, have a claim against you for this!]' Then he [Esau can] say to them, 'Why did you pursue your brother Joseph [to harm him]? You are no better than I!' But if Joseph should come to him and say, 'Why did you pursue your brother?', he [Esau] will have no answer. For if Esau were to say '[I pursued him] because he did me evil!' [Joseph could reply,] 'My brothers also requited me with evil, and I requited them with good!' Immediately he [Esau would have to] be silent. And about this is it written, 'See, they are become like straw, Fire consumes them; They cannot save themselves From the power of the flame . . .' (Isaiah 47:14).  'Behold, they are become like straw' -- this refers to Esau . . . [Translation incomplete]"

He [then] found a pleasant tree with a stream below it and sweet fruit and pleasant shade. He ate from its fruit and drank from its waters and slept it its shade and he returned to himself. At the time that he left to go, he said to it, 'Tree, O, tree, with what can I bless you? That there should be streams below you? Behold, there are streams below you. That your fruit should be sweet? Behold, your fruit are sweet. That your shade should be pleasant? Behold, your shade is pleasant. But rather, May it be the Will that all of the saplings that will be planted from you be like you.' So did the Holy One, blessed be He say to Avraham, 'Avraham, with what can I bless you? If I say, \"Go and make Me known,\" behold, you have made Me known. If I say, \"Crown Me,\" behold, you have crowned Me But rather, May it be the Will that all of the offspring of your innards be like you.' Therefore it is stated, 'And he will be like a planted tree, etc. that gives off its fruit in its time' - these are the Torah scholars that will be many from your seed; 'and its leaf does not wither' - that masters of faith not cease from your seed; 'and everything that he does be successful' - this is Avraham, who shook up all of the kings of the East and the West, as it is stated (Isaiah 41:2), 'Who is the one that aroused from the East, justice calls to him in his footstep.'\""
