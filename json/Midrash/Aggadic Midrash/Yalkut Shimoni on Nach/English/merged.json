            "“For when the foundations were destroyed…” Rav Yehudah and Rav Eina, one said ‘if Hezekiah and his supporters had been destroyed then what would the Righteous have accomplished?’ and one said ‘if the Temple were destroyed, then what would the Righteous have accomplished?’ Ulah said ‘if the thoughts of that wicked man were not thwarted, then what would the righteous have accomplished? (Rashi: what would his award have been?) The verse makes sense according to the one who says it refers to the thoughts of the wicked one, that why it says “for the foundations were destroyed.” So too according to the one who says it refers to the Temple, as it is taught, there was a stone there from the time of the first prophets, and it was called shetiyah. But according to the one who says it refers to Hezekiah and his supporters, where do we find that righteous people are called foundation? It is written “For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and He placed the world upon them.” (Shmuel I 2:8) Or one can demonstrate it from here “He gave marvelous counsel, made great wisdom.” (Isaiah 28:29) Rebbe Yochanan said, why is it (the Torah) called wisdom (toshia)? Because it wears out (mateshet) one’s strength. Another explanation: because it was given in secret due to the accuser. Another explanation: formless words of on which the world rests. Another explanation: David said before the Holy One, if you have left and abandoned Ya’akov, who is the foundation of the world, as it says “the righteous is the foundation of the world,” (Mishle 10:25) what acts have You done for the ones who keep the commandments?  If wicked ones arise and destroy the foundations which face the deeps, the righteous of the world…"

            "His tabernacle was in Shalem – R’ Brachia said: from the beginning of the creation of the world the Holy One made for Himself a tabernacle in Jerusalem. He, so to speak, would pray in it and say ‘may be willed that My children will do My will, in order that I not destroy My house and sanctuary. Since it was destroyed He prays and says ‘may it be willed that my children repent that I bring nearer the building of My house. You should know that this is indeed the case as it says, “I will bring them to My holy mount, and I will cause them to rejoice in My house of prayer…” (Isaiah 56:7) It says My house of prayer, not their house of prayer. This teaches us that Gd prays.\n"
