            "...Rabi Pinchas and Rabi Chilkiyah said in the name of Rabi Simon: the ministering angels gathered to Hashem and said before Him: Master of the world, when is the beginning of the year? And He said: Why do you ask Me? I and you should ask the Court Below. And what is the meaning of \"like Hashem our G-d whenever we call upon Him,\"--calling upon Him is by the festivals, as it is said, \"These are the festivals of Hashem, a holy calling.\" Rav Krispa said in the name of Rav Yochanan: in the past, these were the festivals of  Hashem; from now on, it is as you call them. If you call them, they are My festivals, and if not, they are not My festivals. \"This month is for you\"--you count according to it and the nations of the world do not count according to it. Rebbi said in the name of Rabi Yehuda bar Ilai: the way of the world is that the greater count according to the greater, and the smaller count according to the smaller. Eisav, who is greater, counts according to the sun, which is greater, and Yaakov, who is smaller, counts according to the moon, which is smaller. Rav Nachman said: it's a good sign; the greater one rules during the day and does not rule at night, so too the wicked Eisav rules in This World and does not rule in the World to Come. The smaller one rules by day and by night, so too Yaakov rules in This World and in the World to Come. Rav Nachman said: all the time that the light of the greater one shines, the light of the smaller one is not noticed; when the light of the greater one sets, the light of the smaller one is noticed. So too as long as the light of Eisav is shining, the light of Yaakov is not noticed; once Eisav's light sets, the light of Yaakov is noticed, as it is said: \"Arise and give light...\" This month [is the first of months:] Rav Shmuel bar Abba said, every month that is begun from six hours or less, the eye has power to see it. From six hours or more, eyes have no power to see it. And the month that Hashem said to Moshe [Nisan 2448] was begun from above six hours, and no eye could see it; but Hashem showed it to him with a finger and said to him, \"this month....\". Rav Acha said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani: the year that Yisrael left Egypt, the months of the year and the months of the period were equal. Rav Chiyya said in the name of Rav Yochanan: Hashem wrapped Himself in a talis with tzitzis and stood Moshe here and Aharon here, and called to Michael and Gavriel, and He made them as if they were the witnesses of the new moon. He said to them: how did you see the moon? Before the sun or after the sun? To its north or to its south? How much was it tilted, and how wide was it?--He said to them, according to this order [of questioning] your children will be sanctifying the month Below; through an elder and through witnesses and through a talis with tzitzis..."

            "\"And the waters will came back and cover the chariot and the horsemen\" (Exodus 14:26) And even Par'oh, according to Rabi Yehuda, as it says \"the chariots of Phar'oh and his army\" (15:4). Rabi Natan says Par'oh was the exception, since we have this verse about him: \"maybe for this I made you stand up\"(Exodus 9:16). And there are those who say that at the end Par'oh went down and drowned, as it says \"and the horse of Par'oh came\" (Exodus 15:19). \"And the children of Israel went into the sea in dry ground\" - the angels of service were astounded, saying: 'the children of Israel, idolaters that they are, are coming on dry land?!' And from where do we know that even the sea was filled with rage from Above? Because the text says \"and the waters were like rage to them\" [since the vav is missing to the word chomah, wall, it can be read as chema, rage; so you can re-read the verse as \"the water was like anger on their right and on their left\"]. And what caused them to be saved from their right and their left? From the right, it was Torah, which they would receive later on, as it says \"From His right, [He gave] a fiery law to them\". And left? This is tefilin."

So is the Holy One Blesses Be He. When He spoke, every individual Yisrael maintained: \"He spoke to me!\" \"I am Hashem your (plural) G-d\" is not written here, rather \" I am Hashem your (singular) G-d\". Said R' Yosi: In accordance with each and everyone's personal capacities did the word speak to him. Do not be astonished at the Manna which came down on Yisrael - each one tasting the flavour that he was capable of tasting - the infants in accordance with their capacities... the young men in accordance with their capacities... and the old in accordance with their capacities. If that was so in the case of the Manna, that everyone tasted the flavour that he could appreciate, the word (the word of Hashem at the receiving of the Torah), all the more so! Said (King) David (Psalm 29:4): \" The Voice of Hashem is in strength\". It does not say \"In HIS strength\", but just strength - in the strength (capacities) of each man.",
