                "... “Why do you cry out to Me? Speak to the children of Israel and let them travel.” (Exodus 14:15) R’ Yishmael says: ‘Why do you cry out to Me?’ In the merit of Jerusalem I will split the sea for them, as it says “Awaken, awaken, put on your strength, O Zion; put on the garments of your beauty, Jerusalem the Holy City, for no longer shall the uncircumcised or the unclean continue to enter you.” (Isaiah 52:1) and it says “Awaken, awaken, dress yourself with strength, O arm of the Lord, awaken, awaken like days of old, generations of yore; are you not the one that hewed Rahab and slew the sea monster? Are you not the one who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep? Who made the depths of the sea a road for the redeemed ones to pass?” (Isaiah 51:9-10)"

                "“… and I will make Him a habitation (v’anvehu)” (Exodus 15:2) R’ Yishmael says: is it possible for one of flesh and blood to beautify (l’hanvot) his Creator? Rather I will beautify Him with the commandments. I will make before Him a beautiful lulav, a beautiful sukkah, beautiful tzitzit, beautiful tefillin. Abba Shaul says: I will be like Him. Just as He is merciful and gracious, so too you should be merciful and gracious. R’ Yosi HaGalili says: proclaim the glories and praises of the Holy One before the nations of the world. R’ Yosi ben Dormaskit says: I will make before Him a beautiful Temple. ‘Dwelling (naveh)’ always refers to the Holy Temple as it says “…and made his dwelling desolate.” (Psalms 79:7) And it says “See Zion, the city of our gathering; your eyes shall see Jerusalem, a tranquil dwelling…” (Isaiah 33:20)"

                "Four are called an inheritance (nachalah). The Holy Temple is called an inheritance, as it says “…on the mount of Your heritage…” (Shemot 15:17) The land of Israel is called an inheritance, as it says “…in the land which the Lord, your God, gives to you as an inheritance…” (Devarim 25:19) So too the Torah is called an inheritance, as it says “From the gift, to the streams (nachliel)…” (Bamidbar 21:19) And Israel is called an inheritance, as it says “…My people and My heritage, Israel…” (Yoel 4:2) The Holy One said: let Israel, who are called inheritance, come to the land of Israel, which is called inheritance, and build the holy Temple, which is called in heritance, in the merit of the Torah, which is called inheritance. That is why it says ‘on the mount of your heritage.’ “Directed toward Your habitation…” (Shemot 15:17) this is one of the indications that the throne below is aligned with the throne above. So too it says “The Lord is in His Holy Temple. The Lord-His throne is in Heaven…” (Tehillim 11:4) And it says “I have surely built You a house to dwell in (bet zevul); a settled place for You to dwell in forever.” (Melachim I 8:13)"
