                "From Corinne's horror of Arabian audio, etc.: We have already heard in the opening of our speech what it was that started this mask and what they should talk about in the Arab audio reading season before talking about the Dawn reading season. For in the Torah, we must positively state that in you and your place you want to say that it will be read when people sleep and the time of their sleep. And he wanted to say what he said when the priests entered in their donation when the unclean priests who dipped in their donation came in and it would be nothing more than the day's bride when the Bible said everyone who was cleansed of his impurity and the sun and purified and would eat from the saints and who had to say from the time that the priests came in One to our benefit is from his words and he is an unclean priest when he is allowed to eat with another donation of the sun and if he is still unwell and that this baptism after completing the gonorrhea or leprosy will not do him a baptism until he makes the sacrifices he deserves the next day and announces that he can eat a donation before sacrificing them The victims who did not pay attention Eating contribution to the coming of the sun but not the bringing of atonement. And there is a third night guard with them, and the first Ashmura said is the first third of the night. And the dawn is the twinkling light on the east side before the sun costs about an hour and five hours from the temporary hours. And this taste is the proximity of the sunlight from the thick steamer rising from the land, which is [* the cost of which, according to the steam, refer to] the cost of the land one and fifty miles as explained in the study of wisdom and the wisdom of Rabbin Gamaliel, but they said until midnight Keep a person away from the offense as you will later see and went as Rabbi Gamliel:",
                "2. An act that came in from the banquet house, etc.: The banquet house The wine banquet and this brought to his aid Rabbi Gamliel and he ordered as follows: ",
                "And not only did they say everything they said wise: The locomotives are the milk of sacrifices that the priests will sacrifice every day. And organs are chunks of proximity every day and that is what the scripture said to one lamb and a goat. And the rest of those milks and those organs are sacrificed all night until dawn, as the scripture says in perpetuity, which exceeds its focus on the altar all night until cattle. And eating saints whom the Holy Order is blessed to eat that they will not eat but for one day which is said to eat on that day will not leave him until their cattle do so that they will eat the day of the Sabbath and at night till dawn. And what they all said until midnight, and even though it was time for the dawn to rise, he was reluctant to push it on and found something else to do before dawn. And that's what they said to keep a person out of the offense "
