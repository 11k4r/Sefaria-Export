                "That is to say, Moshe was very humble, such that he received the Torah, which is compared to water that leaves a high place and collects in a low one [Taanit]. And so he received Torah from Sinai, the lowest of the mountains [Megillah 29a]. This teaches that only through humility, the source of all attributes of integrity, can one attain Torah."
