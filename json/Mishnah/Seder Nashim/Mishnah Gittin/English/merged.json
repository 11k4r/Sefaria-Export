            "One who brings a bill of divorce from overseas must say, \"[This document] was written and signed in my presence.\" Rabban Gamliel says, \"[This statement must be made] even [when it was brought] from Rekem and Cheger.\" Rabbi Elazar says, \"Even from Kefar Luddim to Lydda.\" And the Sages say, \"Only one who brings the bill of divorce from overseas or one who brings it there must say, 'It was written and signed in my  presence.'\" And one who brings [a bill of divorce] from one province to another, in an overseas land must say,  'It was written and signed in my  presence.'\" Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, \"Even from [one] district to [another] district.\"", 
            "Rabbi Yehudah says, \"From Rekem to the East and Rekem is like the East; from Ashkelon to the South and Ashkelon is like the South; from Acco to the North and Acco is like the North.\" Rabbi Meir says, \"Acco is like Eretz Yisrael with regard to bills of divorce.\"", 
            "[With regard to] one who brings a bill of divorce within Eretz Yisrael, he need not say, \"It was written and signed in my presence.\" If there are any objectors [to its validity], [its validity] must be upheld by [confirming the signatures of] its signatories. [With regard to] one who brings a bill of divorce from overseas, and is not able to say,  \"It was written and signed in my presence,\" [its validity] must be upheld by [confirming the signatures of] its signatories.", 
            "Both bills of divorce of women and deeds of manumission for slaves, are alike with regard to one who brings them from, or brings them to [a distant land]. And this is one of the ways in which [the laws of] bills of divorce and deeds of manumission are alike.", 
            "Any document that bears [the signature of] a Samaritan witness, is invalid, except for bills of divorce and deeds of manumission. It once happened that they brought a bill of divorce to Rabban Gamaliel in Kefar Otnai, and its [signed] witnesses were Samaritans, and he declared it valid. Any document brought to secular courts, even if their signatories are non-Jews, are valid, except for bills of divorce and deeds of manumission. Rabbi Shimon says, \"Even these are valid; [the exceptions] were mentioned only when they were prepared unofficially [i.e., outside of the official court system].", 
            "[With regard to] one who says, \"Give this bill of divorce to my wife, or this deed of manumission to my slave,\" if he wants to take both of them back, he may take them back. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, \"[That this is only allowable] with [regard to] bills of divorce for women, but not with deeds of manumission, because it we may confer an advantage upon a person in his absence, but we may not confer upon him any disadvantage, except in his presence; for, if a person wants not to feed his slave, he may do so, but not to feed his wife, he may not.\" [Rabbi Meir] said to them: \"Does he not disqualify his slave from [eating] <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] just as he disqualifies his wife?\" [The Sages] said to him, \"It is because the slave is his acquisition.\" [With regard to] one who says, \"Give this bill of divorce to my wife, and this deed of manumission to my slave,\" and he dies [before it was delivered], they may not be delivered [to the parties mentioned] after [his] death. [If he said], \"Give a maneh [a specific unit of money] to So and so,\" and he dies, they give [the money even] after [his] death. "

            "\tIf one brings a get from abroad and says: \"Before me, it was written, but it was not signed before me\"; \"Before me, it was signed, but it was not written before me\"; \"Before me, all of it was written, and before me, half of it was signed\" [i.e., one of the witnesses signed]; \"Before me, half of it was written, and before me, all of it was signed\" — it is invalid. [This, if only the last half (were written); but (if he said:) \"Before me, the first half (containing the names of the man and the woman and the date) was written,\" it is valid. And for the first half, too, it is not necessary that he witness the writing itself; but if he heard the sound of the pen upon the paper at the time of writing, it is sufficient.] If one says: \"Before me, it was written,\" and the other: \"Before me, it was signed,\" it is invalid. [This, when the get is brought by one of them. For the rabbis required the messenger bringing the get to say both. But if the get were brought by both, it is valid, two who bring a get not being required to say: \"Before me, it was written and before me it was signed.\" If two say: \"Before us, it was written,\" and one says: \"Before me, it was signed,\" it is invalid. [This, when the get is brought by one of them; but if it is brought by both, it is valid.] And R. Yehudah rules it valid [even if it is brought by one of them. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Yehudah.]", 
            "\tIf it were written in the daytime and signed in the daytime; in the night, and signed at night; at night, and signed in the daytime — it is valid. [For the day appertains to the night (preceding it), so that it (the date on the get) is not mukdam (prior, to the date of the signing)]. (If it were written) in the daytime, and signed at night, it is invalid. [For it is mukdam. The rabbis instituted a date in gittin as a decree, lest one be married to his sister's daughter, and she be adulterous, and he, pitying her, that she not be put to death by strangulation, give her an undated get, so that when they testify against her in beth-din, she could produce her get and say: \"I was divorced and single at that time.\"] R. Shimon rules it valid, R. Shimon saying that all gittin written in the daytime and signed at night are invalid, except for the gittin of women. [For R. Shimon holds that the sages instituted a date in gittin because of fruits. For if there were no date on the get, the husband could continue selling the nichsei melog fruits of his wife after divorcing her, and when a claim were brought against him, he could say: \"I sold them before the divorce.\" And, accordingly, R. Shimon rules that a get written in the daytime and signed at night is valid, even though it is mukdam; for he holds that once her husband determined to divorce her, even though he did not yet do so, he no longer has title to the fruits. The halachah is not in accordance with R. Shimon.]", 
            "\tGittin can be written with all things: with ink, with paint, with sikra [a red dye], with gum resin, with vitriol, and with all (other) things whose impression remains. They are not written with juices or with fruit-liquid, or with any (other) thing whose impression does not remain. Gittin are written on all things: on a [torn-off] olive leaf, on the horn of a cow (and he gives her the cow) [for he cannot cut the horn off after he writes it, it being written (Deuteronomy 24:1): \"And he shall write her a scroll of divorce, and he shall place it in her hand\" — that which lacks only writing and giving; to exclude that which lacks writing, cutting and giving]; on the hand of a bondsman, and he gives her the bondsman. R. Yossi Haglili says: Gittin are not written on things which have a spirit of life, and not on foods. [For the Torah called a get \"sefer\" (a scroll). Just as a scroll is characterized by not having a spirit of life and not being edible, so, all that does not have a spirit of life and is not edible. And the rabbis say: if it were written: \"in a sefer,\" it would be as you say. But now that it is written \"sefer,\" sefirath devarim (\"relating details\" of the get) is the intent. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]", 
            "\tGittin are not written on what is attached to the ground, [\"cutting\" lacking]. If it were written on what was attached, torn off, signed, and given to her, it is valid. [This is what is meant: If he wrote the tofess (the entire get excluding the place of the man, the place of the woman, and the date) on something attached to the ground, and it were torn off and signed — that is, if he wrote the toref (the place of the man and the woman and the date) after it were torn off, it is valid. For since the toref was written on what was torn off, even though the tofess was written on what was attached, it is valid.] R. Yehudah rules it to be invalid, until it be both written and signed on what is detached. R. Yehudah b. Betheira says: Gittin are written neither on erased paper nor on diftera, for it lends itself to forging. And the sages permit it. [(\"neither on erased paper\":) For he can erase what he wishes up to the (signatures of the) witnesses, and write above it what he wishes, without anything being noticed, the witnesses, too, being signed on what is erased. (\"diftera\":) Its erasure is not noticeable. Diftera is a skin prepared with salt and flour, but not with gall-nut. (\"And the sages permit it\":) with gittin only, the sages holding that the witnesses of delivery (of the get to the woman) effect the divorce, and not the witnesses of the signing. But with other writs, where the witnesses of the signing are relied upon, the sages agree that they are written neither on erased paper nor on diftera. The halachah is in accordance with the sages.]", 
            "\tAll are fit to write a get, even a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor. [This, on condition that an adult stands over him and tells him: \"Write it on behalf of that man.\" But a gentile or a bondsman, even if an adult stands over him, should not write the get ab initio, for they are of independent intellect, and act on their own behalf; so that even if an adult tells them to write it for someone else, they write it on their own. And if a gentile or a bondsman writes the tofess of the get, and a knowing Israelite writes the toref — the name of the man and the woman and the date, all of these requiring lishmah (specific intent) — the get is valid. Likewise, a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, who, according to our Mishnah, are fit to write a get, are fit only with respect to the tofess, but, with respect to the toref, it is not valid unless written by a knowing, adult Israelite.] The woman may write her get, and the man may write his receipt (of payment of the kethubah). For the get takes effect only through its signatories. All are fit to bring the get, except a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, [who lack independent intellect], one who is blind [He is not qualified to bring the get from abroad, not being able to say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" But to bring a get in Eretz Yisrael, where he need not say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed\" — or even abroad, if the get is validated through its signatories, or to be the woman's messenger to receive her get — for all of these, a blind man is fit], and a gentile. [For he is not included in the Law of gittin and kiddushin (marriage). And in an area where he himself is not included, he cannot serve as a messenger for another.]",

But if he possesses his faculties, and then became a deaf-mute, and then regained his faculties; if he possessed sight, and then became blind, and then regained his sight [(it is valid) even if he did not regain his sight. For since he possessed sight when he received the get, he is qualified to be a messenger, being able to say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" But since we must learn later: \"and then he regained his intellect,\" that he must be of independent intellect at the time of giving, we also learn in the beginning: \"and then he regained his sight.\" And all who are unfit to testify by reason of transgression are not fit to bring the get, not being believed to say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" And if the get were validated through its signatories, they are fit to bring it.]; if he possessed intellect, and then became an imbecile, and then regained his intellect, it is valid. This is the rule: Wherever there is da'ath (independent intellect) in the beginning and in the end, it (the get) is valid.", 
            "\tEven the women who are not believed to say that her husband died are believed to bring her get: her mother-in-law, the daughter of her mother-in-law, her co-wife, her yevamah, and her husband's daughter. [They are not believed to say that her husband died, for they hate her and desire her undoing.] What is the difference between a get and death (in the above instance)? (In the get) the writing is the indicator. The woman herself is permitted to bring her get, so long as she says: \"Before me, it was written and before me it was signed.\" [This, only if the husband stipulated with her when he gave her the get that she be divorced only in a certain beth-din and that she say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\" Beth-din take it from her after she says this, and they appoint a messenger to return it to her. But a woman who brings a get wherever she may be is divorced, even if the get is not validated through its signatories, and she need not say: \"Before me, it was written, and before me it was signed.\"]"

            "Every bill of divorce which is not written for a particular woman is invalid. How so? If one was passing through the market and he heard the voice of the scribes saying, \"So-and-so divorces So-and-so from Such-and-such a place,\" and he said [to himself], \"That is my name and that is the name of my wife,\" it is invalid to divorce [his wife] with that [bill of divorce]. Moreover, if one wrote [a  bill of divorce] with which to divorce his wife, and he changed his mind, and a fellow townsman found him and said to him, \"My name is the same as your name and my wife's name is the same as your wife's name,\" the bill of divorce is invalid [for the latter] to divorce [his wife] with it. Moreover, if one had two wives,and their names are the same, if he wrote a  bill of divorce to divorce the elder, he may not use it to divorce the younger. Moreover, if one says to a scribe, \"Write a  bill of divorce, so that I may divorce whichever one I desire,\" it is invalid to divorce with it. ", 
            "[With regard to] one who writes blank forms of bills of divorce must leave space [for the insertion of the name of] the husband and space [for the name of] the wife, and space for the date.

In forms of deeds of sale, one must leave space for [the insertion of the name of] the buyer and space for the seller, and space for the purchase money, space for [the description of] the field [sold], and space for the date. [This is all] due to the [special] enactment. Rabbi Yehudah disqualifies all [blank forms]. Rabbi Elazar considers them all valid, with the exception of a  bill of divorce, because it is stated (Deuteronomy 24:1), \"He shall write unto her [a bill of divorce],\" [indicating] for her in particular.", 
            "[With regard to] one who brings a  bill of divorce and it becomes lost, if he found it immediately, it is valid; but if not, it is invalid.

However, with regard to a city that had been captured by soldiers, or a ship that was lost at sea and one who was taken out to be killed, we place upon him the stringencies of those who are alive and the stringencies of those who are dead; [neither the] a daughter of an Israelite who married a Kohen nor a daughter of a Kohen who married an Israelite may eat <i>terumah</i>.

Therefore, they would forbear from administering the oath to her, and she would lose her kethubah.] R. Gamliel the elder instituted that she vow to the orphans whatever (formula of vow) they desire [such as: \"I bevow enjoyment of this and this food if I have derived any benefit from my kethubah\"], and she collects her kethubah.

But because of \"the general good\" — because we fear that one of the witnesses to the delivery might die, and the get be like a mere shard in her hand, (it was instituted that witnesses sign)]. Hillel instituted the prozbol for \"the general good.\" [For because he saw the people forbearing to lend each other (in apprehension of the loan's being dissolved by the shemitah year), and (by their forbearance) transgressing (Deuteronomy 15:9): \"Take heed unto yourself lest there be in your heart a thing of wickedness, etc.\" — he arose and instituted the prozbol.

And with what is not known to many, there is relatively less promiscuity, and she was, accordingly, not penalized.] R. Meir says: With every vow that requires the deliberation of a sage, he may not take her back. (With every vow) that does not require the probing of a sage, he may take her back. [R. Meir holds the rationale (for forbidding him to take her back) is the possibility of undermining (the get). Therefore, with a vow that he himself cannot annul, but which only a sage can absolve her of, he can undermine the get after she remarries by saying: \"Had I known that a sage could have absolved you of it, I would not have divorced you.\" But with a get that does not require the probing of a sage, but which can be annulled by the husband himself, the sages did not need to forbid him to take her back. For he cannot compromise her by saying: \"Had I known, etc.\", for it was an \"open\" vow, which he could have annulled, and he did not.] R. Eliezer said: They forbade the one [i.e., taking her back in the instance of a vow which requires the probing of a sage] only because of the other [which does not require it. For with one that does require it, we need not fear undermining, for he cannot say: \"Had I known that a sage could have absolved her of it, I would not have divorced her.\" For \"we are witnesses\" that even had he known it, he would have divorced her, a man not wanting his wife to be demeaned in beth-din before a sage, to go to his beth-din and to inquire as to her oath. But it is because of a vow that does not require a sage, which the husband himself could have annulled, that they forbade (him to take her back) in all instances, that he not say: \"Had I known that I could have annulled it, I would not have divorced her.\"] R. Yossi b. R. Yehudah said; It happened in Tziddon that one said to his wife: \"I vow to divorce you,\" and he divorced her, and the sages permitted him to take her back, for \"the general good.\" [The gemara explains that something is lacking and that this is the intent: When is this so (that he may not take her back)? When she vowed. But if he vowed to divorce her, and he divorced her, he may take her back, and we do not fear any undermining. And R. Yossi b. R. Yehudah said: It also happened in Tziddon that one said to his wife: \"Konam, if I do not divorce you.\" That is: May all the fruits in the world be forbidden to me if I do not divorce you. And he divorced her, and the sages permitted him to take her back. (\"for the general good\":) That is, the sages said: \"One who divorces his wife because of a vow may not take her back\" only for \"the general good,\" in that we apprehend subsequent undermining. But this is possible only where she vows. Where he vows, however, the consideration of \"the general good\" does not obtain, and he was permitted to take her back. The halachah is in accordance with R. Yossi.]", 
            "\tIf one divorced his wife on the grounds of her being an eilonith (incapable of bearing children) — R. Yehudah says: He may not take her back [lest she marry another and have children, and he say: \"Had I known this, even if they had given me a hundred manah, I would not have divorced you.\"] The sages say: He may take her back [for we do not fear (the above) \"undermining.\" The gemara explains: Who are \"the sages\"? R. Meir, who holds that a double-condition (t'nai kaful) is required; and our instance is one in which he did not double the condition, not telling her: \"Be apprised that I am divorcing you on the grounds of your being an eilonith; and, if you are not an eilonith, it is not a get,\" in which instance (not having doubled it thus), it is a get even if she is not an eilonith.] If she married another and had children from him, and she wished to claim her kethubah, [for an eilonith has no kethubah; and now that she was found not to be an eilonith, she wishes to claim her kethubah] — she is told: \"You would do better to remain silent than to speak.\" [For he could tell her: \"Had I known that in the end I would have to pay your kethubah, I would not have divorced you,\" thus voiding the get and rendering her children mamzerim.]",

If one sold his field to a gentile, he buys and brings bikkurim (first-fruits) from it (see Rashi), for \"the general good.\" [Every year he must buy its first-fruits from the gentile and bring them to Jerusalem.

When a person bought a field from a husband, and then of his wife, the bargain is void; but if he bought it first of the wife, and subsequently from the husband, it is effective. Such was the first decision. But a subsequent tribunal decided, that a person who bought a field from a Sicaricon must pay a fourth part of the price paid for the purchase to the rightful owner of the field. This is when it is not in the power of the latter to repurchase his field; but when that is the case, the rightful owners are to be preferred to any one.

            "If a scribe wrote a bill of divorce for the man and a receipt for the woman [acknowledging the receipt of the amount of her <i>ketubah</i>], and he made a mistake and gave the bill of divorce to the woman, and the receipt to the man, and they exchanged them; and later, behold the bill of divorce is produced by the man and the receipt by the woman [so that it becomes clear that a mistake was made], she must separated from both [her new husband and her original one], and is subject to all the above regulations. Rabbi Eliezer says, \"If the error is discovered in time [i.e. before she remarried], it is not a [valid] bill of divorce, but if [it is discovered] after a while, it is a [valid] bill of divorce. Because it is not in the rights [of the first husband] to destroy the claim the second husband.\" If one wrote [a bill of divorce] to divorce his wife, and changed his mind, Beit Shammai says, \"He has disqualified her from the Kehuna [priesthood].\" Beit Hillel say, \"Even if he gave it to her on condition and the condition was not met, he has not disqualified her from the Kehuna.\"", 
            "[With regard to] one who divorced his wife and spent the night with her at an inn, Beit Shammai say, \"She does not require a second bill of divorce from him.\" Beit Hillel say, \"She requires a second bill of divorce from him.\" [This difference of opinion is only] when she became divorced from marriage; but if she was divorced from betrothal, they agree that she does not require a second bill of divorce from him, because he has not yet been intimate with her. If one married a woman based on [her having received] a \"bald\" bill of divorce, she must separate from both [husbands], and is subject to all the above regulations.", 
            "[With regard to] a \"bald\" bill of divorce, everyone may complete it; these are the words of Ben Nannas. Rabbi Akiva says, \"Only relatives who are suitable to testify in other matters may complete it.\" What is a \"bald\" bill of divorce? One which has more folds than signatories."

            "[With regard to] One who divorces his wife and says to her, \"You are permitted to marry anyone, except for So-and-so,\" Rabbi Eliezer permits, but the Sages prohibit it. How must he act? He must take it from her, and give it back to her, and he must say to her, \"You are permitted to anyone.\" But if he wrote [the exception] in [the bill of divorce], even if went back and erased it, it is invalid.", 
            "[If the husband said,] \"You are permitted to anyone, except to my father or to your father, to my brother or to your brother, to a slave or to a non-Jew,\" or to any other person with whom betrothal is invalid, it is valid. [If he said,] \"You are permitted to anyone, except as a widow to a <i>Kohen Gadol</i> [high priest], or as a divorced woman or one released by <i>Chalitzah</i> [the ceremony performed to release a widow of a childless man from the obligation of levirate marriage] to an ordinary Kohen, as a <i>mamzeret</i> [the female offspring of an adulterous or incestuous relationship who is prohibited from marrying much of the Jewish population] or Gibeonite to an Israelite, or as a female Israelite to a <i>mamzer</i> or Gibeonite,\" or to anyone with whom the betrothal is valid, despite being prohibited, it is invalid.", 
            "The [essential] body of the bill of divorce is: \"You are permitted to [marry] anyone.\" Rabbi Yehudah says, \"And this that will be yours from me a scroll of divorce and a letter of separation and a document of release, so that you may marry any man that you wish.\" The [essential] body of a document for the release of a slave is, \"You are a free woman, you are on your own.\"", 
            "There are three bills of divorce that are invalid, yet, if she remarried the child is legitimate: If he wrote [the bill of divorce] in his own hand and there are no witnesses [signed] on it; if there are [signed] witnesses but there is no date; if there is a date, but only one witness [signed] on it. These are three cases when the bill of divorce is invalid, but the child is legitimate. Rabbi Elazar says, \"Even if there are witnesses [signed] on it, if he gave it to her in front of witnesses it is valid. And she may collect [debts] from mortgaged property [using this document] since witnesses [need] sign on a bill of divorce only due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.", 
            "If two [men] sent two equivalent bills of divorce and they got mixed up, [each one] gives both [bills of divorce] to each [woman]; therefore, if one of them gets lost, the second one is nullified. If five men wrote a general statement [in a single bill of divorce], So-and-so divorces So-and so, and So-and-so divorces So-and-so, and the witnesses are [signed] at the bottom, they are all valid, and it must be delivered to each one. If the form is written [separately] for each one and the witnesses are [signed] on the bottom, whichever [bill of divorce] has [the names of the] witnesses read with it is is valid.", 
            "[With regard to] two bills of divorce that one wrote side by side , and two witnesses sign in Hebrew under the one, and continuing under the other and two witnesses sign in Greek under the one and continuing under the other, whichever has the first witnesses read along with it is valid. If one witness signed in Hebrew and one witness in Greek [and another] one witness signed in Hebrew and one witness in Greek under one continuing under the other, they are both invalid.", 
            "If he left out part of the [bill of divorce] and he wrote it on a second page, and the witnesses are [signed] underneath, it is valid. If the witnesses signed it at the beginning of the page, on the side, or on the back, it is invalid. If one bill of divorce was written head-to head with another and the witnesses [were signed] in the middle, both are invalid. If they were foot-to-foot [i.e., the ends met in the middle], and the witnesses [were signed] in the middle, the one that the witnesses are read with it is valid. If the top of one was where the end of the other is, and the witnesses [were signed] in the middle, the one for which the witnesses are read at the end is valid.", 
            "[With regard to] a bill of divorce that was written in Hebrew and its witnesses [signed] in Greek, or was written in Greek and its witnesses [signed] in Hebrew, or one witness in Hebrew and one witness in Greek, or the scribe [also signed it with] one witness, it is valid. [If the witness signed] \"So-and-so, a witness\" it is valid. I[If he signed] \"So-and-so, son of So-and-so, but he did not write, \"a witness,\" it is valid. And thus was it customary for the pure, pious ones of Jerusalem to do. If he wrote his nickname or her nickname, it is valid. A bill of divorce given under compulsion, if [forced by]Jewish [court], it is valid; if by non-Jews, it is invalid. Among the non-Jewish [court] they may beat him and say, \"Do what the Jewish [court] is telling you,\" and that is valid.", 
            "If her name is [the subject of rumor] that goes round the town, saying, \"She is betrothed,\" she is [considered to be] betrothed; \"She is divorced,\" she is [considered to be] divorced. This is as long as there is no reasonable explanation [to dispute the rumor]. What is a reasonable explanation? [For example,] So-and-so divorced his wife on condition, or he threw her [the money of] betrothal and it was unclear whether it [landed] closer to her or closer to him, these are reasonable explanations.", 
            "Beit Shammai say, \"No man shall divorce his wife, unless he found in her unchaste behaviour, as it is stated [Deuteronomy 24:1], 'Because he found in her '<i>ervat davar</i>' [unchaste behavior].'\" Beit Hillel say, \"Even if she spoiled his food, because it is said, <i>ervat davar</i>\".  Rabbi Akivah says, \"Even if he found another [woman] prettier than her, as it is stated [ibid.] 'If it happen that she does not find favor in his eyes.'\""
