            "Introduction to Avodah Zarah<br>“Avodah Zarah” is the Hebrew word for idolatry.  It literally means “foreign worship”.  Tractate Avodah Zarah discusses the prohibition of Jews using objects that non-Jews may have used while worshipping idols.  The central idea is that once an object has been used in idol worship the object is forbidden to be used by Jews.  There are many passages in the Torah which strictly forbid Jews from worshipping idols and enjoin them to destroy any of the objects used in idol worship (see for instance Exodus 23:24, 32-33; 34:12-16; Deuteronomy 7:1-5, 25-26; 12:1-3).  The Rabbis went further in these prohibitions and created an entire system of law meant to keep Jews away from non-Jews and their idolatrous practices. Throughout Jewish history these laws aided in preserving the distinct identity of the Jewish people.  However, they also were a primary cause in anti-Semitism, with non-Jews frequently scorning Jews for their separatist practices.<br>Rabbi Menahem Meiri, a Talmudic commentator who lived in Provence in the 14th century recognized that Christianity and Islam were not the same as the pagan religions that existed in the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Christianity and Islam are both monotheistic religions with systems of law and many shared values with Judaism.  He therefore stated that most of the laws regarding non-Jews do not apply to the members of these religions. Other Rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Menahem Meiri. Even the Meiri often insisted that the Jews had to continue to distance themselves from non-Jews, based on Talmudic law.<br>Whether or not we agree with Rabbi Menahem Meiri or with his detractors, while learning this tractate I think we should keep in mind the vast differences between the circumstances in which we live and in which the rabbis lived.  The Rabbis were surrounded by a hostile culture from which they wanted to keep as great of a distance as possible.  Oftehn times they were creating a “straw” non-Jew, one whose behavior does not reflect how non-Jews actually acted. This is often a strategy adopted by a group that wishes to differentiate itself from other groups.<br>In today’s world our surrounding culture is thankfully much more respectful of Jewish differences. We do, and should, celebrate and learn from our contacts with people from all cultures, and certainly, I believe we should be respectful of the customs, practices and beliefs that differentiate Jews from non-Jews. However, we should also keep in mind that the ultimate goal of the Rabbis was to preserve Jewish identity and religion. The problem of how we accomplish this today when most of these laws are no longer observed and contact between Jews and non-Jews is great, is probably the greatest problem that modern Jews face.", 
            "Exodus 23:13 states, “Make no mention of the names of other gods; they shall not be heard on your lips.”  From the last part of this verse, “they shall not be heard on your lips” the Rabbis created a midrash that a Jew should avoid giving a non-Jew a reason to bring a sacrifice or libation to his foreign god.  Therefore, during the three days preceding pagan holidays, Jews should avoid any business transactions with non-Jews, lest the non-Jew thank his god for this transaction.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, this prohibition works in both directions.  It is forbidden for Jews to sell, lend or repay non-Jews and likewise it is forbidden to buy, borrow or receive repayment from them.  According to this opinion, all of these transactions may potentially cause the non-Jew to celebrate and therefore should be avoided.  Rabbi Judah dissents with regards to receiving repayment from non-Jews.  Since repaying a debt causes sorrow to a person, it is permitted to receive repayment during this time, since the non-Jew will not thank his god after having done so.  The Rabbis respond to Rabbi Judah that repaying a debt can indeed be a cause of celebration, even if the immediate parting with the money is depressing.  Therefore it too is prohibited three days preceding a holiday.<br>We should note that although this mishnah seems to be of a restrictive nature, it does indeed allow business transactions at any time that is not three days before their festivals.  In other words, by forbidding the conduct of business on certain days the mishnah tacitly permits conducting business with non-Jews on other days.  This was of course an economic necessity; even before the modern “global economy” no people could survive without conducting business with other peoples.", 
            "Introduction<br>The tractate opens with a lexigraphical discussion of the word I have translated “festival”—איד, whether it is spelled with an aleph or an ayin. While today Ashkenazim and Sephardim do not distinguish in pronouncing these letters, originally they were pronounced differently. Jews of Yemenite descent still pronounce the ayin as a guttural letter, closer to the Arabic sound of “gh.” This is why Aza in Hebrew became Gaza or Amora (and in Sodom and Amora) became Gemorra.", 
            "Rav and Shmuel disagree as to the exact word that appears in the Mishnah which I have rendered “festivals.”", 
            "To support both readings in the Mishnah, the Talmud quotes verses that use both words. We should note that the words have different meanings and neither means “festivals.” Most scholars do not think that the rabbinic word is actually related to the biblical Hebrew. Rather, it comes from a different origin altogether (and is related to the word Ides, as in “the Ides of March.) The sugya presents midrash on the biblical word—it connects two words that sound the same but originally had different meanings.", 
            "The one who related the word to Deuteronomy, where it is found with an aleph, chose that verse because there the word has the connotation of calamity. It is as if he says that the festivals of the idolaters are actually calamities.", 
            "The reading of the word with an ayin connects it to the verse in Isaiah. There it means testimony brought before God. This reading is preferable because the testimony brought before God is what will bring about their calamity.", 
            "The problem is that the verse from Isaiah does not refer to idolaters. The word “testimonies/witnesses” refers to Israelites.", 
            "Huna son of R. Joshua finds another verse that uses the word “edehem” with an aleph and clearly refers to idolaters.", 
            "Introduction<br>This section begins a long aggadah in which the nations come in front of God at the end of days and God judges them for their failings. In a sense, the aggadah’s purpose is to explain why the Torah was given to Israel and not to the other nations.", 
            "At the end of days God will invite all of the nations to come forward and justify themselves in front of Him for having observed the Torah.", 
            "At first all of the nations come in front of God all mixed in together. But then they separate such that each comes one at a time. As we shall see, each kingdom will come in front of God, one at a time."

        [
            "The Talmud corrects a small misunderstanding in the previous text. God could not have been confused as to which nation is which. God is, after all, all-knowing. Rather, God separated them out for their own good. This would make it easier for them to understand God’s words, which as we shall see, were directed at individual nations.", 
            "Introduction<br>Rome is the first to enter in front of God.", 
            "The first kingdom to enter is Rome, for they were the most powerful nation in the world, certainly at the time of the rabbis.", 
            "This section answers why the most important party comes in for judgement first. It follows the pattern of the king standing trial before the community does. This is either due to the respect owed to the king or to allow the king to stand trial before God’s full anger is aroused.", 
            "The Kingdom of Rome was certainly known for being great and wealthy builders in the ancient world. They come in front of God and claim to have done so all for the sake of Israel. They worked so that Israel could study Torah.", 
            "The Holy Blessed One will say in reply: “You foolish ones in the world, all that which you have done, you have only done to satisfy your own desires. You have established marketplaces to place prostitutes in them; baths, to delight yourself in them; silver and gold, that is mine, as it is said: “Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold, says the Lord of Hosts” (Haggai 2:8).  Are there any among you who have been declaring this? As it is said, “Who among you declares this? (Isaiah 43:9). And “this” is nothing but Torah, as it is said: “And this is the Torah which Moses set before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44).  They will then depart crushed in spirit.<br>God denies all of their claims as to having done anything for Israel. All they did, they did for themselves. The verses in Isaiah 43:9 which began the derashah continues with the phrase, “Who among you declares this?” and “this” is interpreted as referring to Torah. Thus only a nation that actually occupies itself with Torah will be justified.", 
            "Introduction<br>Persia enters next.", 
            "The Persians come in next. This is based on the verse from Daniel that says that the second nation is similar to a bear and R. Joseph identifies the verse as referring to the Persians. As an aside, after reading this, I feel that I may have a bit of bear in me.", 
            "Like the Romans, the Persians also claim that they have been busy building the world so that Israel can be free to occupy themselves with Torah.", 
            "The Persians claims are rejected in the same manner in which the claims of the Romans were.", 
            "The Persians thought they stood a better chance than the Romans because they built the Temple (under the direction of Cyrus and Darius, who let the Israelites return to Israel) whereas the Romans destroyed it.", 
            "The aggadah assumes that at this point every nation comes forth before God, and each nation’s claim fails. The other nations thought they had a chance because at least they did not impress Israel.", 
            "The aggadah mentions Rome and Persia as the most important because their reign, according to rabbinic thought, will last until the end of days. I’m not sure history bore this out. Christianity inherited Rome, but the Vatican does not really “reign” all that much anymore. There are still Persians but not really much of an empire left. Still, these world powers had great influence on world history.", 
            "Introduction<br>The aggadah about all of the nations coming in front of God on judgment day continues. ", 
            "The nations respond to God by saying that they were not even offered the Torah. This claim gets to the heart of a theological problem—how could the nations be judged for not keeping the Torah when it was never given to them. This in essence leads to a counter-midrash. The nations were offered the Torah but none accepted it. This is one answer to that problem. However, within our sugya, we now have two contradictory answers. Were they offered the Torah and did not observe it? Or was it never offered to them?", 
            "The Talmud adjusts their claim against God. God forced the Israelites to accept the Torah. But he did not force the nations. Had he forced them, they would have accepted it. So how can he judge them?", 
            "The Talmud now continues interpreting the next part of the verse from Isaiah, “Let us continue the happenings of old.” God responds to the nations that they did not keep even the commandments that they did receive, the seven Noahide laws. Having seen that collectively they did not keep them, God says that henceforth even if they do observe these commandments, they will not receive their reward for them. This is a very interesting claim. I think the idea is that if one does not regularly observe certain moral precepts, one does not receive reward for happenstance observance of them. Reward entails a commitment to a particular act, to make a habit out of it. Now I know that there are contradictory texts out there. But to me, this is what this text is hinting at. "

            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section concluded with the statement that even if the nations of the world observe the Noahide commandments, they still do not receive a reward for doing so. Today’s section begins with a critique of that view. ", 
            "R. Meir uses the fact that the verse uses the word, “a man,” by that implying any man, to teach that non-Jews receive reward for the Torah they study and the mitzvot they perform. We should note that this sugya is a great example of the multi-vocality of the Talmud. Within a few lines of text we have two diametrically opposed positions. The Talmud will harmonize these views but this does not negate the fact that both are allowed room to exist.", 
            "The resolution is that non-Jews who perform commandments do receive a reward, albeit not one as great as Israel who is commanded to perform the mitzvot.", 
            "We now return to the main thread of the aggadah—the dialogue between God and the nations of the world. I think we can see this claim coming a mile away. Why are the non-Jews punished for not observing the Torah? Do they Jews do such a good job? One need not read far into the Bible to find Jews committing sins rampantly. God attempts to find witnesses to testify that Israel does observe the Torah. Stay tuned—the drama continues tomorrow!",

            "All of these sources and derashot prove that the existence of heaven and earth depend on Israel performing the commandments. This makes them partial witnesses, who are not likely to testify that Israel did not perform the commandments. The notion that the world depends on the performance of the commandments is one found throughout rabbinic literature. The mitzvoth have cosmic importance. ", 
            "God responds that non-Jews themselves can testify that Israelites did not sin. The aggadah now lists some well-known non-Jews throughout history who interacted with various Israelites who did not sin. Most of these are probably familiar episodes. Bildad, Zophar and Eliphaz are the friends of Job who urge him to curse God. Job does not. (Elihu son of Barachel is also a friend of Job, but according to another section of the Talmud, he was Jewish). This brings us back to the verse from Isaiah 43:9 which is the backbone of the entire derashah.", 
            "The nations now plead before God, asking God for in essence a second chance. God responds with a famous statement, that even has echoes in the Gospels.

            "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, God offers the nations the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah of the sukkah, even though the end of days is already here. Today’s section asks whether mitzvoth can be fulfilled at the end of days. Or is it too late then.", 
            "How can God offer a mitzvah to the nations to perform in the world to come? According to a very common Jewish idea, the mitzvoth are to be performed in the here and now, today. The end of days is when people will be rewarded for their performance, but by that point it is too late to actually perform them. ",

            "If God wanted to give the non-Jews a chance to keep the mitzvot, why did he make it so hot for them in the sukkah? The answer is that Jews also have end up sitting in the sukkah when it is quite hot. I can testify to this myself—it can get quite toasty in the sukkah when Sukkot falls early in the season. The next problem is that Jews do not have to sit in the sukkah if its boiling hot and makes them uncomfortable. So why blame the non-Jews for leaving the sukkah in the same situation? The answer is that while Jews need not sit in the sukkah when it’s hot, they should not kick it when they go out.",

To be sure that this is so, non-Jews are not accepted as converts during times when it seems that they may have ulterior motives While the Jewish community will not accept these converts, they will simply begin to act as Jews, in an attempt to save themselves at the time of the Messiah.

            "Earlier we said that God sits in judgment during the second three hours of the day, not the first. So why not pray during the first three hours, when we could assume that God’s mercy would be greater?<br>There are two ways of solving the problem. The first is to switch the order of what God does at what time during the day.<br>The second is to note that it would be better to pray when God is not studying Torah. Torah is “truth”—there is no hiding what one has done. It is absolute, without any mercy. But “judgment” can involve a measure of mercy. Thus it would be better to pray when God is acting as a judge, one involved in the lives of humans, then as something akin to a philosopher, who only cares about absolute truth and justice.", 
            "This statement appeared earlier in the context of God asking the non-Jews to perform the mitzvot at the end of days.", 
            "This midrash on Isaiah was the basis of the long eschatological drama with which the tractate opened. It is brought here again because it is another related statement by R. Joshua b. Levi.", 
            "This is another statement by R. Joshua b. Levi about Jews and non-Jews in the world to come.", 
            "Joshua b. Levi defends the Israelites who worshipped the golden calf. The verse proves the faith of the Israelites that stood at Sinai.", 
            "Here R. Yohanan offers the same explanation as above, but this time including a reference to David’s sin with Bathsheva. While we might find it difficult to accept justification for sinning, this is an excellent justification for why we remember our sinning ancestors. The stories we tell are not of perfect individuals or communities. They are of deeply flawed and human characters, struggling to do the right thing, but often succumbing to temptations."

            "The Talmud now explains why we needed to learn the examples of both the sinning individual and the sinning community to teach that both individuals and communities can do teshuvah.", 
            "A difficult verse in II Samuel is interpreted as alluding to David’s role as teaching of the possibility of repentance.", 
            "Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins with another statement by R. Shmuel b. Nahmani.", 
            "Mitzvot and sins are personified here, leading the person towards justification in the world to come or condemnation at the Day of Judgment.", 
            "The sins a person commits in this world are inextricably tied to them, and accompany them like a dog in the world to come. Note that while “dog” has positive connotations for most of us, it is probably not a positive image in the Talmud.", 
            "Introduction<br>This section discusses what Jewish history might have been like had Israel not sinned with the golden calf.", 
            "The fact that our ancestors sinned at the golden calf, then people would have been like angels (god) and would not have had children. Thus we, those living now, would not have come into existence.", 
            "The implication of the above tradition is that were it not for the sin with the golden calf, the Israelites would have been too pure to engage in procreation. But this is problematic—humanity was commanded to be fruitful from the time of Noah.<br>The provisional answer is that this refers only to humanity up until the time of Sinai. According to this theory, once the Torah was given, Israelites would have been so holy that they would not have procreated. It is an interesting way of perceiving the revelation, even if it is not going to stand.", 
            "The problem is that the Israelites at Sinai were explicitly told—go return to your tents. This is interpreted as meaning that they should go procreate.<br>The Talmud resolves that they were told to have sex with their wives, but not necessarily to procreate. This is an interesting instance where the rabbis are willing to divide the two—sex does not necessarily imply procreation.", 
            "A verse from Deuteronomy seems to imply that God planned for the Israelites to have descendants even before the sin with the golden calf. But this too can be interpreted as referring only to the children born before the revelation on Sinai.", 
            "In this midrash God shows Adam all of the future leaders of the Jewish people, all the way through R. Akiva. Clearly God anticipated that people would procreate even before they sinned with the golden calf.", 
            "This midrash contains the idea that there are a predestined number of souls in a place called the “guf.” Only when they have all been used up with Messiah come. Again, this implies that people were destined to procreate at the creation of the world.", 
            "The Talmud now emends the statement with which this section began. Had they not sinned, Jews would have lived forever. While they would have procreated, those Jews who were at Sinai would eternally overshadow those Jews born later.", 
            "The idea that had they not sinned Jews would have lived forever is problematic—the Torah contains laws which assume that people would die. The laws of levirate marriage assume that married men die and the laws of inheritance clearly assume that people die.<br>The answer is that these laws were written conditionally. They were given under the foreknowledge that they would be relevant only if Israel did not sin.", 
            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section ended by saying that the verses about levirate marriage and inheritance were written “on condition,” meaning they might never come into fruition. Today’s section questions whether the Torah is written this way.", 
            "God made the world’s existence conditional on the acceptance of Torah by the Israelites. The very foundations of the world rest on this observance. This shows that verses can indeed be written “under condition.”", 
            "This baraita is brought as a difficulty on a statement by Resh Lakish earlier, that were it not for the sin with golden calf, Israel would have lived forever. The baraita implies that after Adam was punished for eating from the tree there was no way to abolish death from the world.", 
            "Resh Lakish agrees with R. Yose. Had Israel accepted and observed the Torah, they could have lived forever.", 
            "The verse, “that it may be well with them” seems to promise prosperity, not everlasting life. But R. Yose could respond that immortality is a good thing, so it too could accord with the verse.", 
            "Introduction<br>The first tanna in the baraita we learned yesterday did not read the sin of the calf as causing Israel to lose their mortality. But this seems to contradict the verse in Psalms 82:6.", 
            "The first tanna would interpret the verse “you shall indeed die” not as referring literally to death, but as referring to other types of suffering people that are regarded as if they are dead.", 
            "The Talmud now offers prooftexts that all of these types of people are regarded as if they are dead. Exodus 4:19 is God’s words to Moses telling him to return to Egypt for all of the people who wished him dead in Egypt are now themselves dead. But according to the midrash, those in Egypt who wished him dead were none other than Datan and Aviram, who later rebel against Moses in the wilderness. They are called here “dead” because they had already lost their property.<br>The other prooftexts are relatively straightforward. The verse from Numbers is stated by Moses with regard to Miriam who becomes leprous when she speaks out against Moses. The verse from Genesis is stated by Rachel, when she is still childless.", 
            "All of these verses here are part of a general program to show that God pleaded with Israel to accept the commandments.<br>The Israelites in the desert were ungrateful, refusing to recognize the good that God had done for them. They were the descendants of Adam who was ungrateful to God for the woman whom he had been given.<br>Only at the end of their time in the desert did Moses tell the Israelites that they were ungrateful.<br>Rabbah learns from the experience of the Israelites that it takes forty years to learn the mind of one’s teacher. So students and teachers, give it some time!"
