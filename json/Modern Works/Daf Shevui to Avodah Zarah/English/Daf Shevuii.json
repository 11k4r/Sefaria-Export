            "Introduction to Avodah Zarah<br>“Avodah Zarah” is the Hebrew word for idolatry.  It literally means “foreign worship”.  Tractate Avodah Zarah discusses the prohibition of Jews using objects that non-Jews may have used while worshipping idols.  The central idea is that once an object has been used in idol worship the object is forbidden to be used by Jews.  There are many passages in the Torah which strictly forbid Jews from worshipping idols and enjoin them to destroy any of the objects used in idol worship (see for instance Exodus 23:24, 32-33; 34:12-16; Deuteronomy 7:1-5, 25-26; 12:1-3).  The Rabbis went further in these prohibitions and created an entire system of law meant to keep Jews away from non-Jews and their idolatrous practices. Throughout Jewish history these laws aided in preserving the distinct identity of the Jewish people.  However, they also were a primary cause in anti-Semitism, with non-Jews frequently scorning Jews for their separatist practices.<br>Rabbi Menahem Meiri, a Talmudic commentator who lived in Provence in the 14th century recognized that Christianity and Islam were not the same as the pagan religions that existed in the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Christianity and Islam are both monotheistic religions with systems of law and many shared values with Judaism.  He therefore stated that most of the laws regarding non-Jews do not apply to the members of these religions. Other Rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Menahem Meiri. Even the Meiri often insisted that the Jews had to continue to distance themselves from non-Jews, based on Talmudic law.<br>Whether or not we agree with Rabbi Menahem Meiri or with his detractors, while learning this tractate I think we should keep in mind the vast differences between the circumstances in which we live and in which the rabbis lived.  The Rabbis were surrounded by a hostile culture from which they wanted to keep as great of a distance as possible.  Oftehn times they were creating a “straw” non-Jew, one whose behavior does not reflect how non-Jews actually acted. This is often a strategy adopted by a group that wishes to differentiate itself from other groups.<br>In today’s world our surrounding culture is thankfully much more respectful of Jewish differences. We do, and should, celebrate and learn from our contacts with people from all cultures, and certainly, I believe we should be respectful of the customs, practices and beliefs that differentiate Jews from non-Jews. However, we should also keep in mind that the ultimate goal of the Rabbis was to preserve Jewish identity and religion. The problem of how we accomplish this today when most of these laws are no longer observed and contact between Jews and non-Jews is great, is probably the greatest problem that modern Jews face.", 
            "Exodus 23:13 states, “Make no mention of the names of other gods; they shall not be heard on your lips.”  From the last part of this verse, “they shall not be heard on your lips” the Rabbis created a midrash that a Jew should avoid giving a non-Jew a reason to bring a sacrifice or libation to his foreign god.  Therefore, during the three days preceding pagan holidays, Jews should avoid any business transactions with non-Jews, lest the non-Jew thank his god for this transaction.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, this prohibition works in both directions.  It is forbidden for Jews to sell, lend or repay non-Jews and likewise it is forbidden to buy, borrow or receive repayment from them.  According to this opinion, all of these transactions may potentially cause the non-Jew to celebrate and therefore should be avoided.  Rabbi Judah dissents with regards to receiving repayment from non-Jews.  Since repaying a debt causes sorrow to a person, it is permitted to receive repayment during this time, since the non-Jew will not thank his god after having done so.  The Rabbis respond to Rabbi Judah that repaying a debt can indeed be a cause of celebration, even if the immediate parting with the money is depressing.  Therefore it too is prohibited three days preceding a holiday.<br>We should note that although this mishnah seems to be of a restrictive nature, it does indeed allow business transactions at any time that is not three days before their festivals.  In other words, by forbidding the conduct of business on certain days the mishnah tacitly permits conducting business with non-Jews on other days.  This was of course an economic necessity; even before the modern “global economy” no people could survive without conducting business with other peoples.", 
            "Introduction<br>The tractate opens with a lexigraphical discussion of the word I have translated “festival”—איד, whether it is spelled with an aleph or an ayin. While today Ashkenazim and Sephardim do not distinguish in pronouncing these letters, originally they were pronounced differently. Jews of Yemenite descent still pronounce the ayin as a guttural letter, closer to the Arabic sound of “gh.” This is why Aza in Hebrew became Gaza or Amora (and in Sodom and Amora) became Gemorra.", 
            "Rav and Shmuel disagree as to the exact word that appears in the Mishnah which I have rendered “festivals.”", 
            "To support both readings in the Mishnah, the Talmud quotes verses that use both words. We should note that the words have different meanings and neither means “festivals.” Most scholars do not think that the rabbinic word is actually related to the biblical Hebrew. Rather, it comes from a different origin altogether (and is related to the word Ides, as in “the Ides of March.) The sugya presents midrash on the biblical word—it connects two words that sound the same but originally had different meanings.", 
            "The one who related the word to Deuteronomy, where it is found with an aleph, chose that verse because there the word has the connotation of calamity. It is as if he says that the festivals of the idolaters are actually calamities.", 
            "The reading of the word with an ayin connects it to the verse in Isaiah. There it means testimony brought before God. This reading is preferable because the testimony brought before God is what will bring about their calamity.", 
            "The problem is that the verse from Isaiah does not refer to idolaters. The word “testimonies/witnesses” refers to Israelites.", 
            "Huna son of R. Joshua finds another verse that uses the word “edehem” with an aleph and clearly refers to idolaters.", 
            "Introduction<br>This section begins a long aggadah in which the nations come in front of God at the end of days and God judges them for their failings. In a sense, the aggadah’s purpose is to explain why the Torah was given to Israel and not to the other nations.",

            "At first all of the nations come in front of God all mixed in together. But then they separate such that each comes one at a time. As we shall see, each kingdom will come in front of God, one at a time."

            "The Talmud corrects a small misunderstanding in the previous text. God could not have been confused as to which nation is which. God is, after all, all-knowing. Rather, God separated them out for their own good. This would make it easier for them to understand God’s words, which as we shall see, were directed at individual nations.", 
            "Introduction<br>Rome is the first to enter in front of God.", 
            "The first kingdom to enter is Rome, for they were the most powerful nation in the world, certainly at the time of the rabbis.", 
            "This section answers why the most important party comes in for judgement first. It follows the pattern of the king standing trial before the community does. This is either due to the respect owed to the king or to allow the king to stand trial before God’s full anger is aroused.", 
            "The Kingdom of Rome was certainly known for being great and wealthy builders in the ancient world. They come in front of God and claim to have done so all for the sake of Israel. They worked so that Israel could study Torah.", 
            "The Holy Blessed One will say in reply: “You foolish ones in the world, all that which you have done, you have only done to satisfy your own desires. You have established marketplaces to place prostitutes in them; baths, to delight yourself in them; silver and gold, that is mine, as it is said: “Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold, says the Lord of Hosts” (Haggai 2:8).  Are there any among you who have been declaring this? As it is said, “Who among you declares this? (Isaiah 43:9). And “this” is nothing but Torah, as it is said: “And this is the Torah which Moses set before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44).  They will then depart crushed in spirit.<br>God denies all of their claims as to having done anything for Israel. All they did, they did for themselves. The verses in Isaiah 43:9 which began the derashah continues with the phrase, “Who among you declares this?” and “this” is interpreted as referring to Torah. Thus only a nation that actually occupies itself with Torah will be justified.", 
            "Introduction<br>Persia enters next.", 
            "The Persians come in next. This is based on the verse from Daniel that says that the second nation is similar to a bear and R. Joseph identifies the verse as referring to the Persians. As an aside, after reading this, I feel that I may have a bit of bear in me.", 
            "Like the Romans, the Persians also claim that they have been busy building the world so that Israel can be free to occupy themselves with Torah.", 
            "The Persians claims are rejected in the same manner in which the claims of the Romans were.", 
            "The Persians thought they stood a better chance than the Romans because they built the Temple (under the direction of Cyrus and Darius, who let the Israelites return to Israel) whereas the Romans destroyed it.", 
            "The aggadah assumes that at this point every nation comes forth before God, and each nation’s claim fails. The other nations thought they had a chance because at least they did not impress Israel.", 
            "The aggadah mentions Rome and Persia as the most important because their reign, according to rabbinic thought, will last until the end of days. I’m not sure history bore this out. Christianity inherited Rome, but the Vatican does not really “reign” all that much anymore. There are still Persians but not really much of an empire left. Still, these world powers had great influence on world history.", 
            "Introduction<br>The aggadah about all of the nations coming in front of God on judgment day continues. ", 
            "The nations respond to God by saying that they were not even offered the Torah. This claim gets to the heart of a theological problem—how could the nations be judged for not keeping the Torah when it was never given to them. This in essence leads to a counter-midrash. The nations were offered the Torah but none accepted it. This is one answer to that problem. However, within our sugya, we now have two contradictory answers. Were they offered the Torah and did not observe it? Or was it never offered to them?", 
            "The Talmud adjusts their claim against God. God forced the Israelites to accept the Torah. But he did not force the nations. Had he forced them, they would have accepted it. So how can he judge them?", 
            "The Talmud now continues interpreting the next part of the verse from Isaiah, “Let us continue the happenings of old.” God responds to the nations that they did not keep even the commandments that they did receive, the seven Noahide laws. Having seen that collectively they did not keep them, God says that henceforth even if they do observe these commandments, they will not receive their reward for them. This is a very interesting claim. I think the idea is that if one does not regularly observe certain moral precepts, one does not receive reward for happenstance observance of them. Reward entails a commitment to a particular act, to make a habit out of it. Now I know that there are contradictory texts out there. But to me, this is what this text is hinting at. "

            "Introduction<br>Yesterday’s section concluded with the statement that even if the nations of the world observe the Noahide commandments, they still do not receive a reward for doing so. Today’s section begins with a critique of that view. ", 
            "R. Meir uses the fact that the verse uses the word, “a man,” by that implying any man, to teach that non-Jews receive reward for the Torah they study and the mitzvot they perform. We should note that this sugya is a great example of the multi-vocality of the Talmud. Within a few lines of text we have two diametrically opposed positions. The Talmud will harmonize these views but this does not negate the fact that both are allowed room to exist.", 
            "The resolution is that non-Jews who perform commandments do receive a reward, albeit not one as great as Israel who is commanded to perform the mitzvot.", 
            "We now return to the main thread of the aggadah—the dialogue between God and the nations of the world. I think we can see this claim coming a mile away. Why are the non-Jews punished for not observing the Torah? Do they Jews do such a good job? One need not read far into the Bible to find Jews committing sins rampantly. God attempts to find witnesses to testify that Israel does observe the Torah. Stay tuned—the drama continues tomorrow!", 
            "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, God said that the heavens and the earth would testify that Israel has observed the Torah. Today’s section begins with the response of the nations. ", 
            "All of these sources and derashot prove that the existence of heaven and earth depend on Israel performing the commandments. This makes them partial witnesses, who are not likely to testify that Israel did not perform the commandments. The notion that the world depends on the performance of the commandments is one found throughout rabbinic literature. The mitzvoth have cosmic importance. ", 
            "God responds that non-Jews themselves can testify that Israelites did not sin. The aggadah now lists some well-known non-Jews throughout history who interacted with various Israelites who did not sin. Most of these are probably familiar episodes. Bildad, Zophar and Eliphaz are the friends of Job who urge him to curse God. Job does not. (Elihu son of Barachel is also a friend of Job, but according to another section of the Talmud, he was Jewish). This brings us back to the verse from Isaiah 43:9 which is the backbone of the entire derashah.", 
            "The nations now plead before God, asking God for in essence a second chance. God responds with a famous statement, that even has echoes in the Gospels. However, God does offer them an easy mitzvah to keep. Stay tuned for tomorrow where we see if the nations can keep the mitzvah of sukkah! ", 
            "Introduction<br>At the end of yesterday’s section, God offers the nations the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvah of the sukkah, even though the end of days is already here. Today’s section asks whether mitzvoth can be fulfilled at the end of days. Or is it too late then.", 
            "How can God offer a mitzvah to the nations to perform in the world to come? According to a very common Jewish idea, the mitzvoth are to be performed in the here and now, today. The end of days is when people will be rewarded for their performance, but by that point it is too late to actually perform them. ", 
            "God wanted to give the nations a second chance. This is God after all—He makes up the rules!", 
            "Sukkah is an easy commandment because it does not cause any financial loss. This is different from something like peah (leaving the corners of your field for the poor) which obviously does cause a financial loss.", 
            "The non-Jews go out and make sukkot, but God causes it to be so hot that they tear them down immediately. There is a pun being made on this verse—the last word is “עבות “which is also used in Psalms 118:27, which is connected in rabbinic thought with Sukkot.", 
            "If God wanted to give the non-Jews a chance to keep the mitzvot, why did he make it so hot for them in the sukkah? The answer is that Jews also have end up sitting in the sukkah when it is quite hot. I can testify to this myself—it can get quite toasty in the sukkah when Sukkot falls early in the season. The next problem is that Jews do not have to sit in the sukkah if its boiling hot and makes them uncomfortable. So why blame the non-Jews for leaving the sukkah in the same situation? The answer is that while Jews need not sit in the sukkah when it’s hot, they should not kick it when they go out."

The underlying idea is that non-Jews should convert purely out of love, without any ulterior motive such as justification in the eyes of God or power/money. To be sure that this is so, non-Jews are not accepted as converts during times when it seems that they may have ulterior motives While the Jewish community will not accept these converts, they will simply begin to act as Jews, in an attempt to save themselves at the time of the Messiah.

Torah is “truth”—there is no hiding what one has done. It is absolute, without any mercy. But “judgment” can involve a measure of mercy. Thus it would be better to pray when God is acting as a judge, one involved in the lives of humans, then as something akin to a philosopher, who only cares about absolute truth and justice.",

It might be that R. Ishmael does include the festival day with the three days. It is prohibited to engage in business for three days before, including the festival.

In this chapter, my co-author and I show that the original reason for the prohibition was that participation in the economic aspect of the festival was akin to idol worship itself.

In this view, backsliding is an unforgivable sin.<br>Judah says that if they go back to their previous way of acting with regard to secret matters, then we can no longer trust them. They are in essence acting one way in the public sphere and in another way in private. Such a person has lost all semblance of trustworthiness.

Saturnalia was a popular Roman holiday on the 17th of December, dedicated to the god, Saturn.  Kratesis, which was on the first of August, commemorated the day that Augustus conquered Alexandria in Egypt.  Note that I have used the names of these holidays as Albeck states that they should be read.  Medieval scribes often did not know what these holidays were or what their names were and different forms of the words can be found in other versions of the mishnah.<br>The anniversary of the accession of the king to the throne is also considered to be a day of celebration full of idolatrous practices.<br>The final two days of idolatrous celebration are personal:  one’s birthday and the anniversary of the death of a close relative.  On these days non-Jews would make idolatrous celebrations.  Interestingly, Jews did not traditionally celebrate birthdays because it was seen to be a non-Jewish custom.",

The rabbis disagree with Rabbi Meir and hold that only deaths where the body and clothes were burned on a funeral pyre are celebrated by idolatrous acts.  If the body was not burned on the pyre then the day is not accompanied by idolatry and it is therefore permitted to conduct business with the non-Jew three days before.", 
            "As was previously stated it is forbidden to conduct business with non-Jews during the three days before the personal holidays mentioned in section two.  Here the mishnah lists pagan holidays that Jews can conduct business during the three days before and are only forbidden from doing so on the holiday itself.  These include the day that the non-Jew shaves his beard and lock of hair, which refers to a lock of hair grown at the back of one’s head and is shaved once a year; the day of return from a long trip by sea; the day that one is released from prison and the day in which one marries off one’s son and makes him a celebratory feast.",

            "This is an etymological story of the origins of Kalenda and Saturnalia. Some scholars also point to this story as the origin of why we light candles on Hannukah. Holidays around the winter solstice are often associated with fire, as a way of noting the beginning of the days getting longer, or to at least bring light to the darkest days of the year (in the northern hemisphere). There is also a sense here of cultural expropriation—your holidays were originally our holiday (in a sense) and you corrupted them. While there is of course a negative side to this phenomenon, the supremacist ideology it espouses, it also seems to me quite natural.",

If the world was created in Tishrei, then Adam had never seen a long day, so we can understand why he was afraid. But if it was created in Nisan, then he’d already seen short days which grew longer and then began to grow shorter. Couldn’t he have figured out what was going on?<br>The (somewhat weak) answer is that he had not yet seen such short days.",

Don’t most bulls have them? Is there any reason to note that the bull has these features? The midrash reads this as a bull whose horns were created before its hooves. Now there can only have been one such bull in all of history—the first bull. And who else could have sacrificed the first bull—Adam. So Adam must be saying this verse. And why would Adam offer thanksgiving—because the sun went away and the came back again. It’s actually quite a remarkable piece of exegetical thinking.",

Why not say that he has transgressed only if he actually eats of the sacrifice? Rava reads this out of the verse, which says “and he will call you.” But I think that there is more than a midrash at work here. There is a deeper statement—even if the Jew does not actually transgress, the fact that he lives in an idolatrous environment, in a place where idolaters will be inviting him to participate in their celebratory meals, is already a ticket to transgression.",

The Greeks concede to this argument and Rome and the Israelites win.",

Around the year 10 B.C.E. the sages made two famous decrees concerning impurity. The first is that anyone who walks anywhere outside of Israel becomes ritually impure. The second is that glass vessels are susceptible to impurity. The Torah does not list glass as a substance susceptible to impurity. The third is that around the year 30 B.C.E. the Sanhedrin, the ruling body in Israel, moved from its special chamber in the Temple to another area called “Hanut” which was also on the Temple Mount.",

But this change was not because of Roman persecution. It was because of Jewish corruption. There were so many Jewish murderers at that point that the courts could no longer properly try them. To avoid having to exile so many murderers, the court chose to go into a sort of “mini-exile.” For once their place of judgment had changed, they could no longer adjudicate capital crimes.",

            "The Torah teaches on several occasions that an animal must rest on the Sabbath (see for instance Exodus 20:9). Our mishnah extends this prohibition and prohibits a Jew from selling an animal to a non-Jew, lest the non-Jew use the animal for work on the Sabbath.  This is similar yet somewhat different from the issue which the mishnah discussed previously, selling potentially idolatrous objects to the non-Jew.  In both cases it is forbidden to sell something to a non-Jew.  However, in this case, Jews are not enjoined to prevent non-Jews from working on the Sabbath.  Rather Jews are prohibited from putting Sabbath observant animals into the position where they will have to break the Sabbath.  In other words this prohibition concerns the animal and not the non-Jew himself.<br>Not all animals are used for work.  Small animals, such as sheep and goats are not used for work.  Therefore in a place where it is customary to sell them to non-Jews it is permitted to do so.  In other places it was customary not to sell even small animals to non-Jews, lest the Jew become confused and sell them large animals, which is prohibited in all places.<br>It is forbidden in all places to sell large animals, such as oxen and horses, to non-Jews since they will be used to perform work on the Sabbath.  This prohibition includes calves and foals, even though they do not usually perform work.<br>Rabbi Judah allows one to sell injured animals to non-Jews since they are clearly being purchased for their meat and not in order to do work.<br>Ben Bateira allows the sale of a horse since horses are used for riding, which is not considered by the Rabbis to be work.  Pulling plows, a work performed by oxen is considered work.", 
            "The first clause of the mishnah implies that it is not actually prohibited to sell small animals to idolaters. But there is another mishnah that would prohibit selling any animal to them whatsoever, out of fear that they would have carnal relations with it.", 
            "Rav would say that the two prohibitions go together. If it is a place where it is forbidden to sell them an animal, then it is also forbidden to let them be alone with an animal. But in places where it is permitted to sell, it also permitted to let them alone with the animal."

Once they buy the animal, they will not engage in bestiality with it because this could cause the animal to become sterile. In other words, idolaters will have sex with animals, but not at cost to their own property.", 
            "According to this tradition, Rav actually agrees with R. Elazar. Thus all tannaim agree that once that once an animal is sold to the idolater, we need not be concerned that he will have relations with it.",

            "There are several issues that may arise with selling a large animal to an idolater, but none of them seem to really make sense. We already said that idolaters do not engage in bestiality with their own animals, so that’s not a concern (phew!). Second, we might be concerned that they would make the animal work on Shabbat. But only animals owned by Jews must rest on Shabbat. Not animals owned by non-Jews. So what is the problem?", 
            "Theoretically, the prohibition of selling them a large animal may be because this could lead to loaning or renting them an animal. In such a case the Jew owns the animal and therefore there is a problem with the animal doing work.<br>But, halakhically speaking, when a person borrows or rents an animal he owns it (this is so he will be responsible for damages that happen to the animal). Therefore, the problem returns. Why shouldn’t a Jew sell his animal to an idolater?", 
            "Rami son of R. Yeba explains that this entire prohibition is because the Jewish owner might actually own the animal right when Shabbat begins. During the process of selling the animal, the Jew might give the owner a few moments to “try the animal out.” And then the animal would hear the owner’s voice and while carrying a load walk a bit. This is prohibited because one is not allowed to make his animal work on Shabbat—carrying is work. Lest this scenario occur, the rabbis prohibited selling to idolaters large animals that can carry a load.",

            "The answer is that when it comes to renting your house to an idolater, the rules are stricter due to the verse quoted. The Torah does not need to prohibit bringing an abomination into one’s own home—obviously that is prohibited. What it prohibits is to even allow a pagan to bring an idol into a home rented to him by a Jew. Thus renters do “own” what they are renting. Nevertheless, it is still prohibited to rent living quarters to an idolater (in the land of Israel).", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s sugya we learned that when one rents something he technically owns it. Obviously this does not mean that he does not have to give it back. What it means is that while the object is being rented, it technically belongs to him.",

If an Israelite rents a cow from the priest he may feed it terumah—renting does not constitute acquisition so the priest still owns it. Similarly, if a priest rents a cow from a priest, he may not feed it terumah. Again, renting does not constitute acquisition.", 
            "We now have more reasons as to why it is prohibited to sell a large animal to an idolater. This might lead one to rent or lend an animal or it might to letting the idolater try out the animal on erev Shabbat. Since the Jew still owns the animal, when it works on Shabbat the Jew is violating Shabbat.", 
            "Adda finds a way of allowing a Jew to sell an animal to an idolater. As long as he uses an agent, all of the concerns we might have are removed. Even if the agent lets the idolater try it out on erev Shabbat, the animal will not come to the unfamiliar voice of the agent. And the agent will not lend or rent the animal out because it is not his. Furthermore, he would fear that the idolater would find a fault in the animal and then not buy it.",

But the sexual urges—well those have not gone away. But when they get to the brothel, the prostitutes run away. And one rabbi seems to have known that they would be protected from sin.

The second is due to “the incident about Beruria.” This is not explained anywhere in the Talmud. Rashi adds the following legend. Beruriah made light of the Talmudic assertion that women are “light-minded.” To vindicate the Talmudic maxim, Rabbi Meir sent one of his students to seduce her. Though she initially resisted the student’s advances, she eventually acceded to them. When she realized what she had done she committed suicide out of shame.<br>I should emphasize that this legend is not in the Talmud itself; it is found only in the commentary of Rashi. It is likely that someone (I do not imagine Rashi himself) made this up as a mirror image of Beruriah’s sister. Beruriah is known elsewhere for being learned in matters of Torah. Someone may have invented this text as a way of deterring women from studying Torah. Such study, in the eyes of the author of the legend, will lead to women taking Talmudic learning lightly, for the tradition itself deprecates women. This will eventually lead them to become sexually licentious. Whereas Beruriah’s sister, who does not seem to be learned, cannot be seduced, Beruriah, the learned one, is seduced. Whereas Beruriah’s sister escapes both shame and death, Beruriah is shamed and as a result takes her own life.

Meir prohibits selling the tree before it is felled, because the non-Jew would not lose out by leaving the tree in the ground.

This is true of houses and even truer with regard to fields, for with fields there is the added problem of tithes. Once a Jew sells his field to a non-Jew the field’s produce is not liable for tithing. In this way, the sale reduces the holiness of the field. In Syria, which is adjacent to Israel and was conquered by David but is not considered fully a part of Israel, we can be slightly more lenient. Houses may be rented to non-Jews, but fields still may not, because the produce grown in Syria is still subject to tithes. Outside of the land, a Jew may sell houses, but he still may not sell fields, lest by habit he come to sell fields in the land of Israel as well.\n"

Note that he is still consistent in that the rules are stricter with fields than with houses. The major difference is that he does not rule more strictly in cases that should be permitted (such as selling fields outside of the land) but were forbidden by Rabbi Meir lest one come to sell something that really should not be sold.",

Since the idolater will bring his idols into the house, this would violate the prohibition of allowing idols into one’s home. The idolater may only rent the house from the Jew to use for storage or other non-residential usage. [The Jerusalem Talmud rules that outside of the land of Israel it is permitted to sell or let houses to idolaters even for the purpose of residence. Although in this case too the idolater will bring idols into the house and seemingly thereby cause the Jew to violate the commandment in Deut. 7:26, the essential meaning of the verse is that it is forbidden for a Jew to bring idols into his own house.

There are two reasons not to sell them a field—1) It gives them a foothold in the land; 2) The produce becomes exempt from tithes. But there are also two reasons not to sell them a house—1) It gives them a foothold in the land; 2) The house becomes exempt from a mezuzah. So why is it more obvious with regard to a field than a house. R. Mesharsheya answers that there is no obligation for houses in Israel to have mezuzot. The obligation falls on the person, not on the house. ",

In principle, this should be permitted because this is not the land of Israel. But it is prohibited lest someone come to sell them houses in Israel itself. But the prohibition does not extend to letting them houses, because the prohibition of renting a house in Israel is itself only a safeguard against selling them houses. There is a principle that we do not make a decree not to do something lest someone do something else that is only prohibited by a decree and not by a principle. ",

The answer is that even two non-red hairs on the entire animal disqualify it. While it is evidently easy to produce a mostly red heifer, an exclusively red heifer is difficulty. So now comes the final and obvious difficulty—why do we need non-Jews to produce the red heifer. If all you need is the red cup trick, then we could just make our own red heifer? The answer is that the trick only works with certain breeds of cows, and evidently those breeds are possessed by the non-Jews.

There are two interpretations of what this baraita means when it says that the Jew can put water into the earthenware bottle. Rashi says that this refers to the means by which the bottle is kashered, as we learned above. Other rishonim say that the baraita means that the Jew can put water into the earthenware bottle because the water will not take out the taste of the wine. According to Rashi, the Jew can also put in fish brine or murias (another type of brine) because the taste of the wine will not be perceived in the bottle. Other interpreters perceive this to be another way of kashering the bottle—the sharp taste of the brine will get out the taste of the wine.",

Here the Talmud asks whether the baraita meant that if he put brine and murias into them, the brine is not ex post facto prohibited, but that he should not do so. Or is he completely allowed to do so. R. Zevid’s baraita states even more clearly that he is allowed to put in the brine “ab initio” or “lechatchila” in Hebrew. "

Joshua realized that rennet does not have the status of the animal from which it comes. Rennet from a sacrificial animal can be swallowed (if the priest has an iron stomach). At this stage, R. Joshua allowed cheese curdled with rennet but not cheese curdled with stomach lining (real flesh). Thus the mishnah in Hullin does not reflect R.

In this case, it will lead to Jews worshiping idols. It is this the rabbis wanted to stop. Therefore, they were accepting of conversion. The end of the statement refers twice to “another matter.” The Talmud will clarify this more below.", 
            "Introduction<br>The previous sugya presented the prohibition of having relations with Gentiles as being a rabbinic decree. Our sugya asks if it’s actually from the Torah.<br> I should emphasize that the rabbis seem to have taken it for granted that Jews were not supposed to marry or have sex with non-Jews. The question they are more interested in is where does this prohibition come from? Is it from the Torah, in which case it seems to be inherent in Judaism? Or was it decreed upon by the rabbis, in order to prevent a particular problem from occurring?", 
            "The Torah prohibits intermarriage explicitly—but only with the seven nations that inhabited Canaan when Joshua conquered the land. The rabbis extended this prohibition to cover all non-Jews. ", 
            "R. Shimon b. Yohai says that the Torah already prohibits a Jew from having relations with any non-Jewish women, for any such woman could end up turning the Jew away from God. So then what did Hillel and Shammai’s students do?", 
            "The Torah prohibited marriage with a non-Jewish woman. Marriage leads to the highest level of cultural assimilation, and therefore it was prohibited. The rabbis added that even nonmarital sex is prohibited, also for fear of this leading to idol worship.", 
            "In Genesis 38 Judah suspects that Tamar has had sex outside the framework of marriage. The simple reading of this chapter is that Judah is accusing her of quasi-adultery, but the rabbis read it as non-marital sex. The fact that he states that she is to be penalized for this, implies that sex with a non-Jew is prohibited (he assumes that she had sex with a non-Jew because there were not really that many Israelites around then). So how can we say that the students of Shammai and Hillel initiated this prohibition?", 
            "Perhaps the Torah prohibited a Jewish woman from having sex with a non-Jewish man, for in a patriarchal society she would be drawn into his family. But Jewish men could have sex with non-Jewish women, for these women would be assimilated into Jewish society. Indeed, most Israelite men in the Bible do indeed marry foreign women. Then the later sages prohibited even Jewish men from having sex with non-Jewish women, because after all, this too can frequently lead to assimilation.", 
            "The final resolution is that there is an ancient law from Sinai that prohibits an Israelite man from having sex with a non-Jewish woman. We can see this from the story about Zimri in Numbers 25:6-8. But that was only in public, an act of open rebellion. In private this was not prohibited, until the rabbis came along and prohibited it there as well.", 
            "Introduction<br>According to the end of yesterday’s sugya, the Torah prohibited intercourse with a Gentile in public and the court of Shammai and Hillel prohibited it even in private. Our sugya begins by criticizing that chronology.", 
            "The two rabbis here attribute the prohibition of sex with a non-Jewish woman to the Hasmoneans, who lived about 150 years before Shammai and Hillel. These rabbis use some strong rhetoric with regard to this prohibition, making it akin to several grave sins. The difference between the two is only with regard to the last one. R. Dimi says it is as if she is married. Ravin says it is as if she is a “zonah” which technically is a woman prohibited to a priest.", 
            "The Talmud resolves the difficulty by saying that originally only intercourse was prohibited. Shammai and Hillel prohibited being alone with a non-Jewish woman, for they feared that this would lead to intercourse. Note that there are extensive rules preventing for the most part Jewish men and women from being alone in the same room.", 
            "But another tradition says that in the time of David they already decreed against seclusion. This occurred in the wake of the David and Bathsheba affair.<br>The Talmud answers that the prohibition of seclusion with a Jewish woman is indeed from David’s time. However, it was not yet prohibited for a Jewish man to be secluded with a non-Jewish woman. This was prohibited by Shammai and Hillel’s students.", 
            "R. Yohanan finds a hint in the Torah itself that seclusion with a prohibited women is forbidden. So how can we say that the Court at the time of David prohibited this? It was already prohibited.",

            "Introduction<br>Earlier on this page we read that they “decreed against their daughters on account of another matter, and against this other matter on account of still another matter.” What are these “other matters” that we could not even name?<br>Trigger warning—the passage talks about male-male sex, in a way that makes it clear that the rabbis did not approve. It also talks about sex with very young girls, and while I do not believe that the rabbis approved of this, the text does not condemn it.", 
            "The rabbis feared not only intercourse between Jewish men and non-Jewish women, but also between Jewish men and non-Jewish men. They therefore decreed that non-Jewish male children convey ritual impurity. They seem to have thought that this was a way to keep the boys from playing together.", 
            "There was some debate among the rabbis whether a non-Jewish child gets this status immediately upon birth, or whether it happens later, when he is 9 years old, the age at which the rabbis believe a boy is physically capable of having sex (i.e. maintaining an erection). The decision was the latter."
        ], 
        [
            "Ravina analogizes from the boy to the girl. According to the rabbis, a girl is capable of sex at the age of three [again, this does not mean they advocated such a thing. Just that it is physically possible. I know that this is not a pleasant thing to hear. But it is what the text is referring to]. The girl defiles as if she had genital discharge at the age at which she could potentially have sex.<br>The Talmud perceives this to be obvious. Of course, the rules are the same. After all, if she can have sex, then she could be defiled by the male seminal discharge, and this is possible at the age of three.<br>They answer with what seems a bit of a strange answer. A boy at the age of 9 is not only physically capable of having sex, he can convince a girl to have sex with him (not the boys I know). Whereas a girl at the age of three does not even know what sex is. She could not and would not persuade others to have sex. She might be able to have sex, but she certainly cannot initiate it. Therefore I might not have taught this analogy, and thus Ravina needed to assert it.",

He wants permission to eat non-Jewish bread as well. But Rabbi Judah Nesi’a, the rabbi whose court allowed their oil, fears that if he is too lenient he will tarnish his reputation. No one wants to be called a “permitting court.”",

She will be a widow and potentially subject to levirate marriage (marriage with his brother if her husband did not have children). But R. Judah Nesi’a ruled that the divorce was valid because of the date written on it. This date proves that the husband wanted it to become retroactively valid when he failed to come back. Thus when he fails to come back it is valid from the time it is written.<br>The other rabbis did not agree with Rabbi Judah Nesi’a. And since he had used up two of his leniencies, he did not want to risk a third.",

Judah Nesi’a allowed her to remarry. He held that the date written in the get proves that the husband meant it to become valid retroactively on that day. The other rabbis held that the man meant his get to take effect only after twelve months. And since he died before the twelve months were up, her status is that of a widow and not a divorcee.",

In this case, all sages agree that she the bill of divorce is valid because the husband explicitly stated, “from now onward.” They only disagreed about a case where he might have been understood as saying that the divorce would be valid only when he did not return.", 
            "R. Elazar responds to the old man saying that he had the same question about the mishnah as he did about R. Judah Nesia’s decision to allow the woman in the other case to remarry. He asked this particular man because he evidently was one of the sages who voted with R. Judah Nesi’a. Abaye’s words below will answer this question.", 
            "Abaye here tries to reduce the dispute between the sages and R. Judah Nesi’a. He first brings up two points where they all agree. The man here is understood as saying that his divorce would be valid when the sun rises. Since he said “when” he clearly meant that it would not take place that night. Therefore if he dies at night, she is not divorced.", 
            "If he says “on condition that the sun rise,” he meant to say that the divorce would go into effect immediately. Thus the divorce took effect while he was alive and even if he dies at night, she is divorced.", 
            "The rabbis and R. Judah Nesi’a disagree if the husband says, “If the sun comes out.” R. Judah Nesia’ says that in this case the date proves that his intent is for the divorce to go into effect  retroactively once the sun comes out. It is like saying, “From today if I die.” So even if he dies at night, she is divorced. The other rabbis hold that that this is like saying “when the sun comes out.” So if he dies at night, the divorce never went into effect.<br>People may be wondering what all this hullabaloo is about—after all, she is either a widow or a divorcee. The issue is levirate marriage. If she is a widow, she might have to marry her dead husband’s brother. If she does not want to, she could be left without the ability to remarry.",

Ashkenazim stopped eating them many, many centuries ago. Ostensibly this was because they did not know which were kosher and which were not, but in reality we know why they stopped eating them. No one in Europe ate them. But people in the Middle East did eat them, and Yemenites still eat them. Some of my Ashkenazi friends have tried them. Evidently if you fry them and salt them they taste like meaty potato chips. Sounds good."

One who comes into contact with such a person is not defiled. The rabbis added that he too is defiled, but then Yose b. Yoezer came and restored the law to the more lenient, biblical law. That is why they called him a “permitter.”",

The rabbis added that even when he is not in contact with the corpse he still defiles the other person for seven days. Rabbi Yose b. Yoezer restored the law to its biblical form.",

The verse that says he shall be impure, which means seven days, refers to a person who touches another person who is still in contact with the dead body. And the verse that says that he is only impure until evening refers to one who is no longer in contact with a dead body.",

Yoezer said that made him seem overly lenient—he stated that cases of doubtful impurity in the public domain should be ruled leniently.",

We take these suspicions seriously only when she may have been defiled (had adultery) in the private domain. So too when it comes to doubtful cases of defilement, they are ruled impure only the potential contact occurred in the private domain. Thus we have here the same problem we had before. Yose b. Yoezer’s ruling is the same as the law agreed to by everyone. How then is he a “permitter?”",

Cooked food is “civilized” and therefore sharing it is sharing “civilization.” Uncooked food is different and therefore there is no problem for a Jew to eat uncooked food given to her by a non-Jew. As we shall see, the rabbis were relatively lenient with this rule, seeming to observe it in a very technical sense. My assumption is that they were lenient because they did not really worry that eating cooked food together would be sufficient to lead to assimilation.",

The role of fire in creating civilization is something that both evolutionary biologists and anthropologists have noted. It is likely that one of the major shifts in primate evolution occurred when human beings (homo something or other) learned to cook their meat. This allowed them to digest far more calories, which allowed their brains to grow and for them to evolve in very different directions from other primates. No other animal has the ability to manipulate fire and most animals fear fire (think of Shere Khan from Jungle Book). Thus manipulation of fire is quintessentially human. Once food has been cooked by fire it is out of the animal realm and in the civilized realm.",

In cases like this, where the intention was not to cook but to clear some unwanted thing away, the cooked food should not be prohibited. ",

But if the food was not yet cooked, then if the non-Jew does turn it over on the coals then the food is prohibited. This contradicts what Shmuel said before.<br>The resolution is that R. Yohanan was referring to a case where the non-Jew essentially began the cooking process by putting the pot in the oven. The Jew only put the food into the pot.

My impression is that amoraic rabbis inherited a series of prohibitions that were created during a period in which there was a real fear of assimilation. Many of these prohibitions seem likely to have been created as early as the Second Temple period, when Hellenism was at its height. By amoraic times Jewish identity had more fully coalesced and those Jews who remained within the fold were not threatened by eating food cooked by non-Jews.

It is probably significant that this story occurs in this particular location. The Exilarch was the political leader of the community and as such would have had the most contact with non-Jews.

Sometimes the scales are not so easy to see. I think we can also assume that fish was a very important part of the ancient diet. For those who live near water, fish are easier to catch than wild game. And fish (at least back then) did not have to be fed. They were thus probably one of the easiest and cheapest sources of protein. To be overly restrictive could have negative results.",

The answer is that the conditions simply are not conducive for their growth. The rapid water and its saltiness are not a problem, but the mud is. Ravina revokes Abaye’s leniency—since two other rivers now join the Bab-Nahara, we cannot assume that the fish is kosher.",

The implications from here are that when one cuts most foods with a non-kosher knife, the food is permitted. But not if the food has a sharp taste.",

Indeed, the laws of conversion were probably patterned after these laws. So if a woman who grew up as an am ha’aretz married a haver (pretty remarkable in and of itself) she must accept upon herself these responsibilities. So too with a slave joining a haver’s household. The trust her husband has does not accrue to her immediately.<br>But if a woman marries out—meaning she marries an am ha’aretz, R. Meir says that she maintains her reliability as haver. R. Judah says she does not. Since she grew up as a haver, she never had to accept this responsibility on herself. But now she does. R. Shimon b.

Earlier on daf 38b, Hezekiah held that if we know there was wine used to preserve certain foods then the food is prohibited in benefit and not just for consumption. Thus the words “behold these are prohibited” exclude such foods. But R. Yohanan said that if the wine was only used as a preservative, a Jew may derive benefit from the food. To him the words exclude murias and Bithynian cheese, both of which R. Meir prohibits in benefit.",

If the Jew is watching over the non-Jew we have no such concern and the milk is therefore permitted. Mixing foreign substances with honey would spoil the honey. Therefore we can assume that the non-Jew did not put anything into the honey and it is permitted. Even though some grape juice may be dripping from the cluster of grapes, we are not concerned that the non-Jew used this juice in idol worship and it would be forbidden. The mishnah also notes that the liquid that comes out of grapes is not the type of liquid which makes a food susceptible to impurities.  As we have learned before (Eduyoth 4:6) food cannot become impure until it is made wet by seven types of liquids.  Grape juice is not one of them. Preserved foods into which it is not customary to put wine or vinegar are permitted. If one can see that the fish in the brine is actually herring, it is permitted, unlike the minced fish which was discussed above. In the previous mishnah we learned that it was forbidden to eat pieces of the asa foetida, since the same knife used to cut this plant might have been used to cut non-kosher food. In this mishnah we learn that since they don’t cut the leaves of the as foetida with this type of knife, it is permitted. Olives that have been rolled out into cakes are permitted, since no wine is used in them. According to Rabbi Yose, if the olives have become so soft that the pits fall out, wine might have been put on them to soften them.  Therefore, they are forbidden. Some types of locusts are kosher. When a seller sells them, he brings them from his storehouse and puts them in a small basket, onto which he mixes a little wine.  Due to the addition of this wine, locusts that come from this basket are forbidden.  The locusts that come from the storehouse are permitted since the wine has not yet been put upon them.<br>The mishnah points out that the same is true with regards to terumah.  If a kohen sells locusts from the little basket, we must suspect that he has dripped wine on them, and that the wine might be terumah, which is strictly forbidden to non-priests.  If, however, the locusts come from storage, we can be sure that there is no terumah-wine mixed in with them.",

And if there are forbidden animals, then why is the milk kosher—how do we know where the milk comes from?<br>The answer is that there are indeed forbidden animals in the flock, but the Jew can see the non-Jew at least when he is standing. Although he cannot see him while sitting, the fact that he can see him some time, will cause the non-Jew, who knows that the Jew will not drink from milk from forbidden animals, will not take the milk from there.",

The first is that there is something really not kosher in it (like pig fat). But this would be bad for the honey and cause it to go rancid. The second is that it was cooked by a non-Jew. But this prohibition does not apply to honey since honey can be eaten raw. Third is the possibility that the non-Jew cooked it in his own vessels, which had been used with forbidden food. But this is not prohibited because the taste from the non-Jew’s vessel is considered “a worsening flavor” and in such cases the substance is permitted. Thus there is no reason to be concerned about honey bought from a non-Jew.",

But this is contrasted with a mishnah in which Shammai and Hillel (!) argue over whether grapes that are harvested to be brought to the wine-press are susceptible to impurity through the liquid that oozes out of them. While originally Hillel said that they were not susceptible, he eventually agreed with Shammai that they are.",

Yohanan that they still accord power to the broken pieces of the Dagon idol.<br>But Resh Lakish responds that the priests do not enter the sanctuary not because of the broken pieces of idol, but because they believe that the divinity of the idol has gone into the threshold itself. The broken pieces of idols are not divine in the idolater’s eyes. But the “spirit” of the idol has moved elsewhere.",

Yohanan deduced that fragments of idols are prohibited.<br> But Resh Lakish would say that you could read the mishnah in another way. Fragments of images are prohibited. But whole images are prohibited, in accordance with R. Meir of the first mishnah of the chapter. Thus the mishnah would not imply that fragments of idols are prohibited.", 
            "This section is a difficulty on R. Yohanan. R. Meir holds that images are prohibited, but fragments therefrom are permitted. If we apply the same logic to the opinion of the rabbis we would have to say that idols are prohibited, but fragments therefrom are permitted. ", 
            "R. Yohanan says that the analogy is not correct. Images may not have been worshipped, and when they broke, they may have been annulled. Thus there are two doubts and in cases of a double doubt, we can rule leniently. But in the case of a broken piece of an idol, it may not have been annulled. There is only one doubt, and one doubt is not sufficient to remove from the certainty that the idol was worshipped.",

The produce was certainly untithed at one point (this would be true of all produce). But now the “doubt” about whether it was tithed seems to be significant enough to presume that the produce is tithed. Thus a doubt sets aside a certainty.",

So this might not be a case of “doubt” at all.<br>Second, if one brings his produce into the store room with its chaff, animals may eat it without tithing. So the produce might not have been liable for tithing at all. This is not “doubt setting aside a certainty” but “doubt setting aside another doubt.",

Why doesn’t the priest know that he should not look into the pit to see because that would make him impure? In any case, there seems to have definitely been a source of impurity placed into the pit.

But if he chips a piece off to improve the idol, then the idol has not been annulled.<br>A Jew cannot annul idols. Therefore, it does not matter why he chipped off a piece.<br>But again, this is a difficulty against Resh Lakish. Why shouldn’t we consider this like an idol that broke on its own?<br>Resh Lakish can again solve this according to Rava’s statement.

Therefore, they demand that the idol be destroyed by throwing it into the sea.<br>But again, we could ask. If, as Resh Lakish claims, even an idol that broke on its own can be used by a non-Jew, then why shouldn’t grinding it up be a valid form of annulment, in which case any benefit derived would not be a problem.<br>Again, the solution follows Rava.

Why isn’t this considered an annulled idol, like the case of an idol that broke on its own?<br>Again, the Talmud solves this according to Rava.

But if one does, this does not count as “trespass,” illegal use of Temple property because we cannot be sure that the nest came from that tree.<br>But if the tree was an idol, then one can use the nest.

But it does not count as “trespass” because the twigs did not certainly come from that tree. But if the twigs did certainly come from that tree, then using them should certainly count as trespass.",

One could say that the twigs came from the same tree that was dedicated but that the branches grew after the tree had been dedicated. This baraita might hold that while one should not use such twigs, if one does this does not constitute “trespass.” But if the twigs come from that same tree, then they would also come from the asherah tree and this would prove that an idol that broke on its own accord may be used. In the case of the asherah tree, it would not matter when they grew. They should always be prohibited.",

He is knocking the next off only to get the birds, not the sticks.",

No one “wins” the argument. The halakhah ends up following R. Yohanan, but not because he wins.

            "The fact that the crown fits perfectly on his head is a reward for his having kept God’s precepts. There is room on this spot for both the crown and to wear tefillin. Thus David could wear his tefillin and crown at the same time.", 
            "The verse quoted here refers to the coronation of Yehoash. The “testimony” that he was fit for the crown was that it fit his head. Sort of like the slipper on Cinderella.",

            "This section digresses a bit about Adoniyah. As part of his project of self-aggrandizement, he hires an entourage, sort of like modern celebs. I suppose if he lived today, he’d hire some Instagram followers or maybe some paparazzi to follow him around. In any case, what’s the big deal about 50 people to run in front of him? That does not sound like an impressive number. The Talmud answers that these are special runners—they had their spleens removes, and flesh from their feet removed. This seems to have been an ancient way of improving one’s speed. Doping in sports does not seem to be anything new. "

            "Introduction<br>This mishnah contains a famous story of a discussion between Proclos, a Greek philosopher and Rabban Gamaliel, the Jewish patriarch.", 
            "In order to understand this mishnah we must remember that Roman and Greek society would have been full of statues. Indeed, anywhere a Jew turned his head, he probably saw a statue, often a statue of a god or goddess. If the Jews were to adopt an overly strict attitude towards these statues, and consider them idols, Jews would effectively be prohibited from taking part in most of Greco-Roman society, including such communal institutions such as the bathhouse, roads, bridges and marketplaces. In this mishnah Rabban Gamaliel shows a remarkable degree of flexibility and accommodation to this situation.<br>The story begins with Proklos, the son of Plosphos (this may be the word for philosopher) pointing out that the Torah forbids Rabban Gamaliel’s being in Aphrodite’s bathhouse. Rabban Gamaliel responds that it is not appropriate to respond in the bathhouse. When they leave the bathhouse Rabban Gamaliel answers Proklos’s question. The bathhouse was not made for Aphrodite. Rather it was made for the public use and Aphrodite was  merely placed there as adornment. As such, Rabban Gamaliel’s presence in the bathhouse is not a form of worship to Aphrodite, as it would be in her temple. Furthermore, people do not say that the bathhouse was made to adorn Aphrodite. Rather she is ancillary to the bathhouse and it is the central structure.<br>Rabban Gamaliel further points out that if this sculpture of Aphrodite were truly considered to be a goddess, people would not walk naked in front of her, or have seminal emissions or urinate. Such actions are signs of disrespect, which would not be appropriate in front of a goddess. When the Torah states that a Jew is commanded to destroy idols, the intent is to destroy idols that are treated as gods, and not those that are treated with disrespect.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s sugya begins to comment on the Rabban Gamaliel story.",

He knows that one should not talk Torah in a place in which naked people are found, even if he does not utter the words in Hebrew. But this is not sufficient for the Talmud. They think that even saying this in the bathhouse is not permitted. Thus a tanna teaches that Rabban Gamaliel responded only when he had already left the bathhouse.", 
            "There is an argument here over whether urinating in front of the statue is really a sign that people do not treat the statue with sanctity. According to R. Oshaia, it is not. After all, Rava pointed out that people defecate in front of the Peor statue and this seems to be a sign of honor, not disrespect. Thus Rabban Gamaliels’ answer was deceptive.", 
            "R. Hama b. Joseph says that there is a difference between the Peor statue and Aphrodite. Peor is worshipped by defecating in front of it (at least according to the rabbis). But Aphrodite is not worshipped in this way, and therefore one who urinates in front of her has disrespected the idol and thereby annulled it.", 
            "Introduction<br>The amoraim continue to discuss whether Rabban Gamaliel’s response to Proklos was deceptive.", 
            "Abaye offers a different alternative as to what the deception may have been. One of Rabban Gamaliel’s answers was that he did not enter Aphrodite’s domain, she entered his. But Abaye points out that it is permitted to enter the domain of an idol in order to take a bath, or a stroll in the garden. The prohibition is only to provide direct benefit to the idolatry. Thus Rabban Gamaliel did not need to say that he didn’t enter her domain.<br>But Abaye himself points out that this answer is not actually deceptive. Rabban Gamaliel is a very important person, a real macher. His mere entrance into someone’s domain is considered providing a benefit. So if Rabban Gamaliel had entered Aphrodite’s domain, it would have been a problem. But he did not. She entered his.", 
            "R. Shimi b. Hiyya locates a different way in which Rabban Gamaliel’s answer was deceptive. Urinating on an idol is not considered annulment, according to the mishnah. Thus the fact that people urinate it does not mean that he can derive benefit from it.<br>But R. Shimi b. Hiyya explains that one person urinating on the idol may not be considered annulment. Later, when he calms down, he will make peace with his idol. But people urinate in front of the idol all the time. Thus it is annulled.", 
            "Rabbah b. Ulla has yet another answer as to how Rabban Gamaliel’s response may have been deceptive. Rabban Gamaliel claims that people do not say that the bathhouse was made for Aphrodite. But, Rabbah points out, even if they did say this, it still would not cause the bathhouse too become prohibited because items cannot be dedicated to idol worship. Even if they are, they are still permitted.<br>But Rabbah b. Ulla says that the remark was not actually deceptive. While we would not consider the bathhouse to have been dedicated to idolatry, it still would have been prohibited as an ornament for idolatry. Thus Rabban Gamaliel needed to point out that it is not prohibited because the idol adorns it; not the other way around."

The question is whether the setting up of the egg in an upright position is an integral part of his action in order for it to be prohibited. At first we think it is and that for a natural object like an egg to become prohibited it must first have had some manual labor performed with it. Hizkiyah’s question was whether setting up the egg counts as manual labor. Clearly if he had not erected it, it would not be prohibited.<br>By implication, Hizkiyah would say that boulders that became separate on their own from the mountain are permitted because no manual labor has been performed.",

But for either party, Hizkiyah’s question should be obvious. If it becomes prohibited immediately, then setting it up should make it prohibited. If it does not become prohibited until it is worshipped then there is no question that the egg is permitted. So, Hizkiyah, what are you asking about?",

This is certainly true of a brick which is noticeable when set-up. The Jew demonstratively showed that he wanted the brick to be worshipped.

The blood of a wild animal (deer) or bird that has been slaughtered must be covered.

Since it would lead to a leniency R. Papa did not invoke it. But maybe he would invoke the principle in the case of the lulav, for there it would lead to a stringency—once the tree was worshipped its branches cannot be used, even if the tree was annulled as an idol.

If he is asking about using the blue thread to make clothes for priests, well that is the same as the question asked by Rami b. Hama about making a minchah out of wheat that had been worshipped. And if the question is about tzitzit, that is a personal, non-Temple mitzvah, and that is the same question asked by Resh Lakish about the using a lulav that came from an asherah tree.",

If we hold that the  main aspect is the instruments than surely we cannot use parts of an animal that had been worshipped. But if we hold that the main aspect is the singing, then maybe we can use them, because maybe they are there just to make the singing sound better. Alas, there is again no answer to this question.",

If he was asking about what a person is actually doing when he worships a spring—is he worshipping his own reflection (literally narcissism) or is he worshipping the water (in which case it would be prohibited), then the question should have been about water in a bowl and whether it can be put to secular use. So this must not be the meaning of his question.",

That water has already flowed away and therefore any water subsequently drawn was not actually worshipped. Or was he worshipping the flow, meaning all of the water?

Since he lived there before the shrine was built he does not need to move. However, if the house should fall down he may not rebuild the wall that will be shared with the shrine. What he may do is withdraw four cubits and build his own wall, one which will not be shared with the shrine.",

From here the mishnah learns that just as creeping things transmit impurity, so too do idolatrous objects. The type of impurity that a creeping thing imparts is contact impurity. It does to impart impurity to one who carries it (without touching it). Contact impurity is a lesser type of impurity than carrying impurity.<br>Rabbi Akiva learns the impurity of idolatrous objects from Isaiah 30:22, which explicitly compares idolatrous objects to menstruating women, both being impure and imparting impurity to others. A menstruating woman imparts impurity both through contact and through carrying. So too, according to Rabbi Akiva, do idolatrous objects. In other words Rabbi Akiva holds that the impurity of idolatrous objects is more serious than that of the creeping thing.",

The idolatrous Temple will not get much benefit out of it. But then there is the problem of modesty. A person should not go to the bathroom where everyone can see him.<br>The Talmud offers two solutions. 1) The toilet will be for children, who do not need to be modest when they relieve themselves. 2) Instead of using the place for a toilet, he could put up a fence of thorns and shrubs.

If the building originally existed for other, non-idolatrous, purposes, and then was somehow modified to be idolatrous, the Jew needs to remove the renovations before it is permitted to use the building. In other words, the earlier structure is permitted and only the new parts that were created for idolatry are forbidden. If the idol was only brought into the house, the house is not actually “idolatrous.” The idol may be taken out and the house is permitted.",

A house consists of pieces that were once detached from the ground and now are attached. Things attached to the ground cannot become prohibited if they are worshipped. So it seems like Rav says although the house is currently attached, since its parts were once attached, it is still prohibited.",

In such a case, since it is already attached to the ground, it does not become prohibited.<br>The resolution is that the house becomes prohibited whether he built it for idolatry and then worshipped it or if he worshipped it but did not build it for idolatry. In either case, the house becomes prohibited.",

It seems that what he is trying to say is that for something to be considered an idol, it must be an idol “on the inside.” Almost the same way we treat human beings—our identity is formed more by our inside, than by our external features.",

Since when it comes to the house, the plastering was on the outside and yet it was prohibited, so too when it comes to the stones. Even though the plastering is on the outside, the stones should be prohibited.<br>The solution is that when it comes to the house, there is plastering on the inside too, between the bricks.<br>The problem with this solution is that the Mishnah might be dealing with a case where the house was first plastered to be a regular house, and then was again plastered for it to be an idolatrous shrine. Such a house would be prohibited even though the plastering was on the outside.",

What he said was that even if the person had put the plaster or tile in the stone, if he removes it the stone goes back to being permitted (it is annulled). We might have thought that since the plaster was in the stone, it was like making the stone for idolatrous purposes, so R. Ami teaches us that it is not."

The mishnah now tells a story that happened in Sidon, where there was a suspicion that idolaters were worshipping a certain tree. Underneath the tree was a heap of stones. Rabbi Shimon instructed the other rabbis to examine the heap of stones and when they did they found an image. From here Rabbi Shimon concluded that the tree itself was not worshipped, but rather the image underneath the tree. Therefore the tree was permitted for Jews to use.",

Shmuel says that even if they are going to use the dates to make beer, if they say that the dates are for the “House of Nitzrafei,” the tree is prohibited. This seems to have been some place of idolatry. The word is probably Persian. It appears in one other place in the Talmud (Shabbat 116a, where we learn that neither Rav nor Shmuel would go there.

So if it is forbidden to sit in the “shade of its shade” then one who sits in the “shade” should be impure, like one who walks under the tree according to the mishnah.<br>The Talmud rejects that—even sitting in the shade that corresponds to the height of the tree does not defile.

Eliezer is that the ruling depends on which substance is put in last. If the permitted leaven was put in last, R. Eliezer may permit the dough even though the forbidden dough was still present.

We should note that in some other cases mixtures of prohibited and permissible goods can be fixed.  For instance if one pound of terumah flour should be mixed in with 100 pounds of terumah flour, one may take out one pound of terumah and give it to the kohen, even though that one pound is not the same pound that fell in.  Through this process the remainder becomes permitted to anyone to eat.

If he baked a loaf using asherah wood to heat his oven, he may throw the value of the wood into the Dead Sea, thereby nullifying any benefit he received from that wood.  Afterwards the loaf may be eaten by a Jew.  The Sages disagree.  According to their opinion there is no way to redeem something that was made by using an idolatrous item.", 
            "This section teaches the same thing that was learned in the previous section, only it uses a different example.  Here the wood was used to make a shuttle, a piece of wood used on a loom to weave cloth.  Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages have the same dispute on this section of the mishnah as they did in the previous one.", 
            "Introduction", 
            "Today’s section discusses why the mishnah needed to provided two examples of things made by using the wood of the asherah tree—bread made in an oven heated by the wood of an asherah tree and weaving shuttle made from wood from such a tree. What would we not have known if the mishnah had provided only one example.", 
            "If the only case in the mishnah was that of the baking bread with the asherah wood, I might have thought that in that case R. Eliezer was lenient because by the time the loaf was cooked the wood had been burned in the oven. Since the prohibited substance is destroyed, there is room to be lenient and he can destroy the amount of value equivalent to that loaf and the other loaves are permitted. But with the shuttle that was taken from the tree, when the clothes are done the shuttle remains. So we might have thought that in that case he agrees with the rabbis, there is nothing that can be done besides destroy all of the clothes (a large loss). Therefore, the mishnah had to teach us the case of the clothing.", 
            "This is simply the opposite of above. If the mishnah had included only the second case, I might have thought that the rabbis were strict with regard to the shuttle because it is not destroyed when making the clothes. But they would be more lenient in the case of bread. Therefore, both are necessary.", 
            "One is allowed to destroy the equivalent value of the bread or clothes rather than destroy all of the bread or clothes.", 
            "According to R. Adda b. Ahavah if casks of wine that are forbidden (libated wine, yayin nesekh) are mixed up with permitted casks of wine, they must all be destroyed. One cannot bring a value equivalent to the one forbidden cask to the Dead Sea. This is because the wine itself is a prohibited substance whereas the loaf is not a prohibited substance. It was made with a prohibited substance.<br>Hisda says that the same law holds true for both.",

            "As we will learn in the next chapter, a pagan can “annul” his idol by stopping to treat it as such.  If he does so, what was formerly an idol reverts to being a normal object and a Jew may use it.  This mishnah teaches that removing a piece of an asherah tree is a sign that it is no longer being worshipped.  Evidently the asherah was not used by the pagan for anything but idol worship.  If the pagan does make even the most minimal use of the tree, such as using its leaf, it loses its status as an asherah.  The only exception to this case is if he removes something from the tree for its own sake.  In other words, if he smoothed the tree to make it look better, it is still an asherah and it is still forbidden.  If he did so in order to get a branch, he has annulled its status as an asherah and it is permitted.", 
            "The mishnah taught that if he smoothed off pieces from the tree because he wanted the pieces (for his own sake) then the tree is permitted, but if for the tree’s sake, the tree remains prohibited. But what about the pieces? Are they permitted since they are no longer part of the tree?<br>While amoraim dispute the issue, the baraita says that if an idolater smoothed off the pieces, they are permitted in either case. If the Jew smooths off the tree, the pieces remain prohibited because a Jew cannot annul the idol worship of a non-Jew.", 
            "Rav and Shmuel now begin a debate over annulling pieces that have become broken off of idols. According to Rav, the pieces that have become broken off must be annulled. According to the revised version of Shmuel, only when the idol is in its natural form, must it be annulled. When pieces break off people will not assume that they retain their sanctity.", 
            "The Talmud tries to connect this dispute with the broader dispute over whether idolaters worship fragments of idols—Rav would hold that they do, and Shmuel would say that they do not.<br>The Talmud then rejects this understanding. All hold that idolaters worship fragments. But these pieces are “fragments of fragments.” Over this there is a dispute.", 
            "According to this understanding of the dispute, Rav and Shmuel generally agree that fragments of fragments are permitted. But this is a case of an idol which was made of pieces and broke apart on its own. Rav holds that since an ordinary man, a non-craftsman, can put it back together, the pieces retain their sanctity and must be annulled. But Shmuel says that the idol need only be annulled when it is its natural form. Since this idol has already been broken, it need not be annulled.", 
            "Introduction<br>Mishnah Sanhedrin 7:6 teaches that one who throws stones at a statue of Mercurius (the Roman god, Mercury) is guilty of worshipping the idol, for that is how Mercurius is typically worshipped.  Our mishnah deals with the status of stones found next to the merculis statue.", 
            "According to Rabbi Ishmael, if three stones were found next to the Mercurius statue, we can assume that they were used in worshipping the statue, and they are therefore prohibited.  If there were only two, then we cannot assume that they were placed there for such a purpose and they are permitted.<br>According to the Sages the issue is not the number of stones but rather their proximity to the statue.  Those found next to the idol are prohibited and those found further away are permitted.  Even if three are found further away, we can assume that they were not used in worship.", 
            "According to the Talmud, the rabbis hold that idolaters worship fragments of idols. So if pieces are found on the ground and they can be seen with the Mercurius idol, then they must come from the idol.",

            "Yitzchak b. Joseph now offers a comprehensive interpretation of the dispute. If we know that these stones fell from the Mercurius idol, then R. Ishmael and the sages agree that they are prohibited. Even the one who holds that idolaters do not worship idols would agree in this case because Mercurius idols are made by a pile of rocks. This is not a “broken piece.” If it’s from the Mercurius, then it is simply part of it.",

A baraita states clearly that a Mercurius is three stones, one on top of two.<br>Rava explains that that baraita refers to the main part of a Mercurius, which indeed is one stone on two. But once the main part is built, additional stones can be added on the side.<br>I want to point out that the placing of stones on something is reminiscent of the Jewish practice of putting stones on a grave. Unnaturally placed stones are a way of people saying, “we were here.” Unfortunately, I was at a funeral today and so this sugya came to mind.",

Then other idolaters came, conquered the place and did not worship Mercurius, so they used the stones to pave the ground. Thus we have stones that were once part of idols now being used to pave roads. Can a Jew walk there? Have they been annulled?  Some rabbis did, and others did not.<br>As far as the historicity of this story goes, there may be some echo here of the fact that Israel was placed between the two great powers, the Seleucids in the north and the Ptolemies in the South. The rulers of Israel often found themselves caught between these two powers. I do not know if one of these powers worshipped Mercury while the other did not.", 
            "Yohanan refers to a very righteous person who would walk on those stones. This R. Menahem son of R. Simai was so holy that he would never look even at the image on a coin.",

But Rabbah b. Yirmiyah cannot explain this distinction. “Carpenter” here seems to be a nickname for a scholar, probably due to the high level of skill a carpenter needs to shape his material."

        [
            "Sheshet explains both the difficulty and the solution. The difficulty was how can we annul a sacrificial offering. If these stones are considered offerings they, unlike idols, can never be annulled. The answer is that for an offering to be prohibited it must be like something offered on the altar, and the stones are not like the offerings we put on the altar. The stones are more like an idol and therefore when the idolater treats them with a lack of sanctity, they become permitted.", 
            "This case is unrelated to our larger topic and is brought here because it has the same format and same rabbis as the previous story. Two time periods are being compared—the Sabbatical year when one cannot plant or work the field and “hol hamoed,” the intermediate days of the festivals of Sukkot and Pesah when certain types of work should not be performed. But again, no one can solve the statement.", 
            "Ravina first needs to figure out what the difficulty is. If we think the difficulty is in figuring out why one can treat the tree on the Sabbatical year but not on the festival, this is not a difficulty. The Torah prohibits certain types of agricultural work but there is no prohibition of exertion. Taking care of the tree is not one of those forbidden labors. But on the festival it is prohibited to do all sorts of activities that require exertion. This would include taking care of the tree. So this should not be a difficulty at all.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section continues to deal with the “unsolved” baraita we began to discuss yesterday. For ease of reference I am placing it back here in full:<br>We may remove worms [from a tree] and place manure [on a cut branch] during the Sabbatical year, but we may not remove worms [from a tree] and place manure [on a cut branch] during the [intermediate days of] a festival. On both these occasions we may not prune, but we may smear oil on the place of pruning both during the festival and during the Sabbatical year.", 
            "The Talmud now suggests that the difficulty is why placing manure is permitted while pruning is prohibited. But this too can be easily explained. It is permitted to preserve a tree during hol hamoed and the sabbatical year. One need not let the tree die and evidently placing manure on cuts in the tree is meant to prevent them from dying. But pruning strengthens the tree and is therefore prohibited.", 
            "The next possible difficulty is that our baraita that permits placing manure on the tree during the Sabbatical year contradicts another baraita that allows this only during the time leading up to the Sabbatical year. During the Sabbatical year itself, it is forbidden.", 
            "This difficulty also may be solved. There may be two different kinds of placing manure on the branch—one is to strengthen the tree, and this is prohibited. The other is to preserve the tree and is permitted.", 
            "Again, the Talmud tries to claim that our baraita, which allows smearing oil on the tree, contradicts another baraita which allows smearing oil on unripe figs but only before the Sabbatical year, not on the Sabbatical year itself. But again, this is not really a difficulty. In our case the oil is being smeared on the tree to preserve it after it was pruned. Again, preserving the tree is permitted. But smearing oil on unripe figs is to fatten them up and it is prohibited.", 
            "Finally we get an answer as to what the difficulty is. It is forbidden to place manure on the tree on the festival while it is permitted to smear oil. But both actions are for preserving the tree—so why is one permitted and the other forbidden?", 
            "Breaking the stick in front of the idol is considered an act of idolatry and thus if an Israelite does so he is liable. But throwing the stick at or in front of the idol is not considered an act of idolatry, and thus one who does so is exempt. But why the difference? After all, both have a certain amount of similarity to an act performed in the Temple. Breaking the stick is like slaughtering an animal, and throwing the stick is like sprinkling the blood.<br>Rava explains the difference. For an act to be like sprinkling blood it needs to be an act that is broken up into several parts. When one sprinkles blood on the altar, it is done in parts.

Slaughtering a locust or breaking a stick is like slaughtering an animal and therefore one is liable. But the other rabbis hold that the act must be like an act done inside the Temple. Inside the Temple locusts are not slaughtered nor are sticks broken. Therefore one who does these acts is not liable for idolatry.",

The entire stone is thrown at once, and therefore it is not like the sprinkling of blood done on the altar.<br>The question was posed to many rabbis, and finally answered by Rav. The stone thrown at the idol becomes part of the idol. In other words, it is not an offering. It is an idol in and of itself.",

This way the stones are worshipped. Theoretically, the last stone thrown should be permitted since it has not yet been worshipped by having another . But since we do not know which stone was last, they must all be prohibited.<br>Ashi says that each stone is an offering to itself and to the next one. Thus the stone in a sense “worships itself.” Talented stone!",

There are two problems here: 1) nothing like these two objects is put on the altar; 2) they are put all at one time. This is not “sprinkling that is broken up.”",

            "Rava determined that the defect of which R. Abahu was speaking was a missing limb. This is because he compares the prohibition of sacrificing for idolatry with the rules governing sacrifices for the sons of Noah. The sons of Noah is a term used to refer to non-Jews who observe (at least) seven main laws, one of which is the prohibition of idolatry. The rules of sacrifice governing them are not as strict as those for Jews, and they may sacrifice animals with blemishes in their eyes. But they may not sacrifice those with missing limbs. Therefore, for the person worshiping an idol to be exempt, the blemish must be of the more serious kind, it must be missing a limb.", 
            "Elazar used the phrase “of every living thing” to derive the law that a Noahide cannot sacrifice an animal missing a limb. We know that Noah sacrificed animals when he left the ark. Therefore we can assume that God told him to bring on the ark animals that could be sacrificed. But elsewhere those same words are used to exclude a “trefa,” a term used to refer to animal that has a wound that will cause it die in a defined period of time.<br>The Talmud then resolves the difficulty by saying that the exclusion of a trefa from being permitted for sacrifice comes from the words “to keep seed alive.” The animals that Noah brought on the ark had to be able to procreate, and the assumption here is that trefot cannot procreate.", 
            "Some rabbis hold that a trefa can bear offspring, and thus could not be excluded by the words “to keep seed alive.” So then we would need the verse “from every living thing” to exclude a trefa from being eligible for sacrifice, and we would not have a verse for excluding animals missing a limb.<br>The Talmud now suggests that the source for the exclusion of trefot is the words “with you”—the animal must be like Noah, who we suppose for now was “whole” and not a “trefa.”", 
            "So how do we know that Noah himself was not a trefa. At first the Talmud argues that we can learn that he was whole from one of the adjectives used to describe him, “without blemish” or “righteous.” The problem is that those adjectives may refer to his character qualities and not his bodily ones.<br>The Talmud resolves the difficulty by noting that if we assume that the phrase “with you” means “animals like you” it makes no sense for God to tell Noah to take only blemished animals onto the ark. Thus the phrase “like you” must mean that Noah was physically unblemished. We now have a source to exclude trefot, and the words “of every living thing” can be used to exclude animals missing a limb.", 
            "The word “with you” excludes the trefa. So then why does the Torah also have to use the phrase, “to keep seed alive.” This teaches that the animals must be able to procreate. They cannot be so old that they can no longer procreate nor can they be castrated. The purpose of bringing them on the ark was not so that they could keep Noah company (a cute thought, to be sure). The purpose was clearly for them to repopulate the world after the flood. Thus while the word does not mean that Noah could not bring a trefa, but it does mean that the animals he brought on board had to be fertile.", 
            "Introduction<br>Earlier we learned that the Mercurius idol was worshipped by throwing stones at it. But what if someone sacrificed an animal to it? Is he liable even though this is not the normal way in which one worships a Mercurius?", 
            "Elazar rules that although Mercurius is usually worshipped by having stones thrown at it, if one slaughters an animal to it, he is still liable. This is because there is an “extra” verse that implies that one is liable for worshipping idols even if it is not in their “usual” way. Deuteronomy 12:30 is read as teaching that one is liable for worshipping idols by doing so in the way that the nations (the goyim) serve their God. This would be the idol’s “usual” way. So then what more do we learn from Leviticus 17:7? We learn that a Jew is liable even if he worships the idol in a way that is not usual to the idol.", 
            "The Talmud brings up the problem that Leviticus 17:7 is already used in a different midrash. To understand this midrash I think it is important to see the full verses:<br>(3) If anyone of the house of Israel slaughters an ox or sheep or goat in the camp, or does so outside the camp,<br>(4) And does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to present it as an offering to the LORD, before the LORD’s Tabernacle, bloodguilt shall be imputed to that man: he has shed blood; that man shall be cut off from among his people.<br>(5) This is in order that the Israelites may bring the sacrifices which they have been making in the open field—that they may bring them before the LORD, to the priest, at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and offer them as sacrifices of well-being to the LORD.”<br>There is some repetition here, particularly between verses four and five. To solve this, the midrash suggests that they refer to different historical settings. The first two verses deal with a period in Jewish history where private altars were prohibited, once the Tabernacle was set up. Thus verse four says that he must bring his offerings to the Tent of Meeting. The verse establishes the punishment for not doing so and a verse in Deuteronomy states the warning. These verses deal with a period in which the animal was dedicated and actually sacrificed when it was prohibited to offer outside of the central sanctuary, after the Tabernacle was erected."

        [
            "The verses that follow, from verse 5 and onwards, refer to a case where the person dedicated the animal when it was still permitted to offer animals on private altars, but then sacrificed it after the Tabernacle had already been erected, when private altars were prohibited. Although the animal was permitted as a sacrifice when it was dedicated, it was forbidden to sacrifice it. And even though he offered it on an altar, Scripture treats this as if the altar was irrelevant. It is like sacrificing in an open field.", 
            "This is the end of the midrashic baraita. Leviticus 17:7 is the negative commandment against sacrificing on a private altar. There is a lighter penalty in the case where he dedicated before it was prohibited to sacrifice on private altars—it is only a negative commandment. This is unlike dedicating and sacrificing when private altars are prohibited which is punishable by karet, as the verse explicitly states.<br>In any case, this concludes the long difficulty. This verse is used here as the negative commandment for slaughtering on a private altar. So how can R. Elazar use it to prove that one who worships an idol in a way not usual to that idol is liable?",

Since this is not typical Mercurius worship, it is permitted for Jews to use these items.<br>However, if anything that is normally sacrificed is found next to a Mercurius, these items are forbidden to Jews.  Since these items are generally used in idol worship, and evidently also in the worship of Mercurius, they are forbidden if they are found in proximity to the idol.",

The answer is that the verse teaches that for the items found “with them” to be prohibited they must be like the items found on them—decorative. Silver and gold are obviously decorative, but for the wood and stone to be prohibited they too must be decorative.<br>Below the Talmud will ask how this proves the halakhah in the mishnah. After all, the list of items in the first half could also be decorative. It seems to me that R. Oshaia’s midrash here originally proved a halakhah that was different from that found in the mishnah.",

The verse that says “with them” implies that anything that is with them is prohibited, so too anything that is “on them” should also be prohibited, even if it is not decorative. In other words, why use the analogy to create a leniency, why not use the opposite analogy to create a stringency?<br>The answer is that if that was the case, we would not even need the verse “on them.” We could derive the full halakhah from the other verse. The mere existence of a second verse implies that one must be a limitation on the other.",

But surely these all can be decorative! The Talmud answers that these are permitted if they are not placed in a decorative fashion on or near the idol. But, by implication, if they were placed in a decorative fashion, they would be prohibited.<br>The need to limit the mishnah shows that R. Oshaia was probably not explaining the mishnah. The mishnah prohibits items that might have been offered to the idol and permits those that are not considered offerings. In contrast, R. Oshaia prohibits decorative items and permits non-decorative ones. It seems that the Talmudic editors used a statement with one concern to explain a statement that had a different concern.",

Peor is worshipped by people defecating on it, and Mercurius by people throwing stones at it.<br>The Talmud clarifies that what this means is that for these two idols there is no distinction between inside and outside the partitions. If the item is either used in the worship of the idol or is decorative it is always prohibited.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section starts with another new mishnah.", 
            "If an idolatrous shrine has a garden or bathhouse in its courtyard, there are certain circumstances in which the garden or bathhouse may nevertheless be used.  First of all one may always use them as long as one doesn’t give any advantage to the idolaters.  This means that one could use the garden or bathhouse as long as he does not pay the idolatrous priests for such use.  Secondly, if the garden or bathhouse was jointly owned by the shrine a private individual, one could always use them, and even pay for their use.  Even though some of the money may go to the shrine, the Jew can consider the payment as going to the individual partner.<br>We should note that Maimonides explains that “to the advantage of” does not mean paying money as we explained above, but rather giving verbal recognition to the owners.  If the bathhouse or garden is jointly owned, one may give verbal advantage to the owners, and even to the idolatrous priests, however, according to Maimonides, one may not pay for the use.", 
            "As soon as an idol is made by a non-Jew it is prohibited, even before it is worshipped.  The reason is that we can safely assume that the non-Jew will worship the idol, and it was certainly made for idolatrous purposes.  However, an idol made by a Jew is only forbidden for Jewish use once it has been worshipped.  The reason is that we cannot be sure that the Jew will worship the idol.  It potentially could be used for decorative, non-idolatrous purposes.", 
            "According to Abaye, when the mishnah says that one may use the garden or bathhouse as long as it is not to the “advantage” it means to the advantage of the priests who run it. A Jew may pay other idolaters for its use.", 
            "Some teach Abaye’s statement in reference to the second clause—one can use a garden if it is jointly owned by an idolatrous temple and by others. He can pay the other owners, but he cannot pay the priests who own it.", 
            "If one teaches Abaye’s statement in reference to the second clause, then he could also teach it in reference to the first clause. In neither case can one make payment directly to the priests.<br>But if one teaches the statement in reference to the first clause, then when it comes to the second clause, where the bathhouse or garden is jointly owned, he can even make payment to the priests. Since the whole bathhouse or garden does not belong to the idolatrous temple, we can say he is using the part owned by others.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s sugya deals with the last part of the mishnah, which discusses whether an idol becomes prohibited when it is made or when it is first worshipped.<br>The midrash cited here discusses the following verse (Deuteronomy 12:2):<br>“You must destroy all the sites at which the nations you are to dispossess worshiped their gods, whether on lofty mountains and on hills or under any luxuriant tree.”", 
            "The mishnah accords with the opinion of R. Akiva—an idol made by an idolater is prohibited immediately. In contrast, R. Yishmael says that such an idol is not prohibited to a Jew until it has actually been worshipped. He derives this from the words of the verse “where the nations worshipped.”", 
            "The midrash above says that Deuteronomy 12:2 is referring to vessels—human-made objects. The problem is that the verse explicitly says “places” not “vessels.” The Talmud explains that we cannot take this word “places” at face value for we have another midrash on the same verse (one we saw above) that says that places (“mountains”) cannot be prohibited. Since it cannot mean that Jews must destroy places where idolatry took place, it must mean that Jews cannot use “vessels” that were used in idolatrous worship."
        ], 
        [
            "Now the problem with the above midrash is that it interprets the verse to refer to “vessels”—things used in the worship ceremony, but then it goes on to use this as a source for a rule about idols. Vessels and idols are not the same thing. The Talmud defends this analogy with another midrash—gods (idols) are compared to vessels—neither become prohibited until they are worshipped or used in a worship service.", 
            "Why doesn’t R. Akiva make this comparison between vessels and idols? He says that the word את interrupts the connection between vessels and idols. So while vessels may be prohibited only once they have been used, idols made by idolaters can be prohibited immediately, which is his position as we saw in the mishnah.", 
            "Introduction<br>Last week’s daf ended by beginning to explain the baraita about when an idol becomes prohibited. I am copying that baraita again for ease of reference:<br>The idol of an idolater is not prohibited until it is worshipped; but if it belonged to an Israelite it is prohibited immediately, the words of R. Yishmael;<br>But R. Akiva says the opposite: The idol of an idolater is prohibited immediately; but if it belonged to an Israelite it is not prohibited until it is worshipped.", 
            "Last week we saw a midrash which explained why R. Ishmael holds that the idol of an idolater is prohibited only once it is worshipped. But what about the second half of his statement—that an idol made by a Jew is prohibited immediately.<br>The Talmud seems to think that this is just common sense. Below we will examine the other possibilities as to when this idol becomes prohibited. It’s not really common sense but rather process of elimination.", 
            "Since we know (from elsewhere) that an idol made by a Jew must be disposed of (it requires geniza) we cannot say that it may be permitted.", 
            "The verse referring to the making of the golden calf proves that as soon as the Jews made the calf they were considered sinners, even before they had worshipped it.", 
            "The verse from Deuteronomy 9 about the golden calf might say only that the person is guilty of sin, not that the idol is prohibited. The Talmud then brings another verse to show that a Jew is cursed for making an idol before he even worships it. But this too does not seem to prove that the idol is prohibited immediately, only that the person who makes it is cursed.<br>To finally solve the issue, the Talmud quotes the next word of the verse—the idol is an abomination as soon as it is made. It need not be worshipped.<br>Akiva, who holds that an idol made by a Jew is not prohibited until it is worshipped, would hold that the idol itself is not an abomination. But making it leads to the abomination of worshipping it.", 
            "Akiva derives the idea that idols made by idolaters become prohibited immediately from a verse that calls them “graven images.” They are prohibited as soon as they are made.", 
            "1. Ishmael would use this verse for a different derashah. The word for graven is “pesilei” and the word for disqualify is “posel.” So R. Ishmael makes a wordplay—how do we know that a non-Jew can annul or disqualify an idol? From the wordplay on this verse.", 
            "In its totality the verse reads, “You shall consign the images of their gods to the fire; you shall not covet the silver and gold on them and keep it for yourselves.” Clearly one is not supposed to keep the silver and gold for oneself. But Shmuel makes a midrash on the verse, reading the second half in isolation, and concluding that sometimes one can keep the silver and gold for oneself. When the idolater makes the idol it becomes prohibited and “you shall not covet it.” But when he annuls it, it is permitted and “you shall keep it for yourselves.”"
