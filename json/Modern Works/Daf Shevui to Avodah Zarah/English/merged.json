            "Introduction to Avodah Zarah<br>“Avodah Zarah” is the Hebrew word for idolatry.  It literally means “foreign worship”.  Tractate Avodah Zarah discusses the prohibition of Jews using objects that non-Jews may have used while worshipping idols.  The central idea is that once an object has been used in idol worship the object is forbidden to be used by Jews.  There are many passages in the Torah which strictly forbid Jews from worshipping idols and enjoin them to destroy any of the objects used in idol worship (see for instance Exodus 23:24, 32-33; 34:12-16; Deuteronomy 7:1-5, 25-26; 12:1-3).  The Rabbis went further in these prohibitions and created an entire system of law meant to keep Jews away from non-Jews and their idolatrous practices. Throughout Jewish history these laws aided in preserving the distinct identity of the Jewish people.  However, they also were a primary cause in anti-Semitism, with non-Jews frequently scorning Jews for their separatist practices.<br>Rabbi Menahem Meiri, a Talmudic commentator who lived in Provence in the 14th century recognized that Christianity and Islam were not the same as the pagan religions that existed in the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud.  Christianity and Islam are both monotheistic religions with systems of law and many shared values with Judaism.  He therefore stated that most of the laws regarding non-Jews do not apply to the members of these religions. Other Rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Menahem Meiri. Even the Meiri often insisted that the Jews had to continue to distance themselves from non-Jews, based on Talmudic law.<br>Whether or not we agree with Rabbi Menahem Meiri or with his detractors, while learning this tractate I think we should keep in mind the vast differences between the circumstances in which we live and in which the rabbis lived.  The Rabbis were surrounded by a hostile culture from which they wanted to keep as great of a distance as possible.  Oftehn times they were creating a “straw” non-Jew, one whose behavior does not reflect how non-Jews actually acted. This is often a strategy adopted by a group that wishes to differentiate itself from other groups.<br>In today’s world our surrounding culture is thankfully much more respectful of Jewish differences. We do, and should, celebrate and learn from our contacts with people from all cultures, and certainly, I believe we should be respectful of the customs, practices and beliefs that differentiate Jews from non-Jews. However, we should also keep in mind that the ultimate goal of the Rabbis was to preserve Jewish identity and religion. The problem of how we accomplish this today when most of these laws are no longer observed and contact between Jews and non-Jews is great, is probably the greatest problem that modern Jews face.", 
            "Exodus 23:13 states, “Make no mention of the names of other gods; they shall not be heard on your lips.”  From the last part of this verse, “they shall not be heard on your lips” the Rabbis created a midrash that a Jew should avoid giving a non-Jew a reason to bring a sacrifice or libation to his foreign god.  Therefore, during the three days preceding pagan holidays, Jews should avoid any business transactions with non-Jews, lest the non-Jew thank his god for this transaction.  According to the first opinion in the mishnah, this prohibition works in both directions.  It is forbidden for Jews to sell, lend or repay non-Jews and likewise it is forbidden to buy, borrow or receive repayment from them.  According to this opinion, all of these transactions may potentially cause the non-Jew to celebrate and therefore should be avoided.  Rabbi Judah dissents with regards to receiving repayment from non-Jews.  Since repaying a debt causes sorrow to a person, it is permitted to receive repayment during this time, since the non-Jew will not thank his god after having done so.  The Rabbis respond to Rabbi Judah that repaying a debt can indeed be a cause of celebration, even if the immediate parting with the money is depressing.  Therefore it too is prohibited three days preceding a holiday.<br>We should note that although this mishnah seems to be of a restrictive nature, it does indeed allow business transactions at any time that is not three days before their festivals.  In other words, by forbidding the conduct of business on certain days the mishnah tacitly permits conducting business with non-Jews on other days.  This was of course an economic necessity; even before the modern “global economy” no people could survive without conducting business with other peoples.", 
            "Introduction<br>The tractate opens with a lexigraphical discussion of the word I have translated “festival”—איד, whether it is spelled with an aleph or an ayin. While today Ashkenazim and Sephardim do not distinguish in pronouncing these letters, originally they were pronounced differently. Jews of Yemenite descent still pronounce the ayin as a guttural letter, closer to the Arabic sound of “gh.” This is why Aza in Hebrew became Gaza or Amora (and in Sodom and Amora) became Gemorra.", 
            "Rav and Shmuel disagree as to the exact word that appears in the Mishnah which I have rendered “festivals.”", 
            "To support both readings in the Mishnah, the Talmud quotes verses that use both words. We should note that the words have different meanings and neither means “festivals.” Most scholars do not think that the rabbinic word is actually related to the biblical Hebrew. Rather, it comes from a different origin altogether (and is related to the word Ides, as in “the Ides of March.) The sugya presents midrash on the biblical word—it connects two words that sound the same but originally had different meanings.", 
            "The one who related the word to Deuteronomy, where it is found with an aleph, chose that verse because there the word has the connotation of calamity. It is as if he says that the festivals of the idolaters are actually calamities.", 
            "The reading of the word with an ayin connects it to the verse in Isaiah. There it means testimony brought before God. This reading is preferable because the testimony brought before God is what will bring about their calamity.", 
            "The problem is that the verse from Isaiah does not refer to idolaters. The word “testimonies/witnesses” refers to Israelites.", 
            "Huna son of R. Joshua finds another verse that uses the word “edehem” with an aleph and clearly refers to idolaters.", 
            "Introduction<br>This section begins a long aggadah in which the nations come in front of God at the end of days and God judges them for their failings. In a sense, the aggadah’s purpose is to explain why the Torah was given to Israel and not to the other nations.", 
            "At the end of days God will invite all of the nations to come forward and justify themselves in front of Him for having observed the Torah.", 
            "At first all of the nations come in front of God all mixed in together. But then they separate such that each comes one at a time. As we shall see, each kingdom will come in front of God, one at a time."

        [
            "The Talmud corrects a small misunderstanding in the previous text. God could not have been confused as to which nation is which. God is, after all, all-knowing. Rather, God separated them out for their own good. This would make it easier for them to understand God’s words, which as we shall see, were directed at individual nations.", 
            "Introduction<br>Rome is the first to enter in front of God.", 
            "The first kingdom to enter is Rome, for they were the most powerful nation in the world, certainly at the time of the rabbis.", 
            "This section answers why the most important party comes in for judgement first. It follows the pattern of the king standing trial before the community does. This is either due to the respect owed to the king or to allow the king to stand trial before God’s full anger is aroused.", 
            "The Kingdom of Rome was certainly known for being great and wealthy builders in the ancient world. They come in front of God and claim to have done so all for the sake of Israel. They worked so that Israel could study Torah.", 
            "The Holy Blessed One will say in reply: “You foolish ones in the world, all that which you have done, you have only done to satisfy your own desires. You have established marketplaces to place prostitutes in them; baths, to delight yourself in them; silver and gold, that is mine, as it is said: “Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold, says the Lord of Hosts” (Haggai 2:8).  Are there any among you who have been declaring this? As it is said, “Who among you declares this? (Isaiah 43:9). And “this” is nothing but Torah, as it is said: “And this is the Torah which Moses set before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44).  They will then depart crushed in spirit.<br>God denies all of their claims as to having done anything for Israel. All they did, they did for themselves. The verses in Isaiah 43:9 which began the derashah continues with the phrase, “Who among you declares this?” and “this” is interpreted as referring to Torah. Thus only a nation that actually occupies itself with Torah will be justified.",

            "The Persians come in next. This is based on the verse from Daniel that says that the second nation is similar to a bear and R. Joseph identifies the verse as referring to the Persians. As an aside, after reading this, I feel that I may have a bit of bear in me.", 
            "Like the Romans, the Persians also claim that they have been busy building the world so that Israel can be free to occupy themselves with Torah.", 
            "The Persians claims are rejected in the same manner in which the claims of the Romans were.",

            "The aggadah assumes that at this point every nation comes forth before God, and each nation’s claim fails. The other nations thought they had a chance because at least they did not impress Israel.", 
            "The aggadah mentions Rome and Persia as the most important because their reign, according to rabbinic thought, will last until the end of days. I’m not sure history bore this out. Christianity inherited Rome, but the Vatican does not really “reign” all that much anymore. There are still Persians but not really much of an empire left. Still, these world powers had great influence on world history.", 
            "Introduction<br>The aggadah about all of the nations coming in front of God on judgment day continues. ", 
            "The nations respond to God by saying that they were not even offered the Torah. This claim gets to the heart of a theological problem—how could the nations be judged for not keeping the Torah when it was never given to them. This in essence leads to a counter-midrash. The nations were offered the Torah but none accepted it. This is one answer to that problem. However, within our sugya, we now have two contradictory answers. Were they offered the Torah and did not observe it? Or was it never offered to them?", 
            "The Talmud adjusts their claim against God. God forced the Israelites to accept the Torah. But he did not force the nations. Had he forced them, they would have accepted it. So how can he judge them?", 
            "The Talmud now continues interpreting the next part of the verse from Isaiah, “Let us continue the happenings of old.” God responds to the nations that they did not keep even the commandments that they did receive, the seven Noahide laws. Having seen that collectively they did not keep them, God says that henceforth even if they do observe these commandments, they will not receive their reward for them. This is a very interesting claim. I think the idea is that if one does not regularly observe certain moral precepts, one does not receive reward for happenstance observance of them. Reward entails a commitment to a particular act, to make a habit out of it. Now I know that there are contradictory texts out there. But to me, this is what this text is hinting at. "

            "R. Meir uses the fact that the verse uses the word, “a man,” by that implying any man, to teach that non-Jews receive reward for the Torah they study and the mitzvot they perform. We should note that this sugya is a great example of the multi-vocality of the Talmud. Within a few lines of text we have two diametrically opposed positions. The Talmud will harmonize these views but this does not negate the fact that both are allowed room to exist.",

            "We now return to the main thread of the aggadah—the dialogue between God and the nations of the world. I think we can see this claim coming a mile away. Why are the non-Jews punished for not observing the Torah? Do they Jews do such a good job? One need not read far into the Bible to find Jews committing sins rampantly. God attempts to find witnesses to testify that Israel does observe the Torah. Stay tuned—the drama continues tomorrow!",

            "God responds that non-Jews themselves can testify that Israelites did not sin. The aggadah now lists some well-known non-Jews throughout history who interacted with various Israelites who did not sin. Most of these are probably familiar episodes. Bildad, Zophar and Eliphaz are the friends of Job who urge him to curse God. Job does not. (Elihu son of Barachel is also a friend of Job, but according to another section of the Talmud, he was Jewish). This brings us back to the verse from Isaiah 43:9 which is the backbone of the entire derashah.",

The answer is that Jews also have end up sitting in the sukkah when it is quite hot. I can testify to this myself—it can get quite toasty in the sukkah when Sukkot falls early in the season. The next problem is that Jews do not have to sit in the sukkah if its boiling hot and makes them uncomfortable. So why blame the non-Jews for leaving the sukkah in the same situation?

But when we look deeper, we will see that they do not hold the same opinion. Ben Batera allows one to sell any horse to an idolater. This is because a horse’s work is to carry a rider, and carrying a rider is not considered work. But the other sages still prohibit selling horses, less one come to sell an ox, which pulls a plow. Nahum the Mede does not allow any horse, just old male horses. Thus he must hold like the other rabbis, and the other rabbis say that Nahum the Mede’s leniency should be hidden.",

Minyomi is not pleased that the sages from Palestine respond in each instance to Nahum the Mede, a sage from the region of Babylonia/Medea, with “let the matter be suppressed and left unsaid.” Abaye responds by saying that there is one case in which we do follow his ruling—one should make a special request for one’s needs while reciting the “who hears prayer” blessing, which is part of the daily Amidah.",

Moses first praised God and then he asked for his needs. R. Joshua says that we too should act in the same manner. But R. Eliezer says that Moses is different. His greatness allows him to sincerely praise God first. But with any other human being, it is better to simply first ask for one’s needs."

Saturnalia was a popular Roman holiday on the 17th of December, dedicated to the god, Saturn.  Kratesis, which was on the first of August, commemorated the day that Augustus conquered Alexandria in Egypt.  Note that I have used the names of these holidays as Albeck states that they should be read.  Medieval scribes often did not know what these holidays were or what their names were and different forms of the words can be found in other versions of the mishnah.<br>The anniversary of the accession of the king to the throne is also considered to be a day of celebration full of idolatrous practices.<br>The final two days of idolatrous celebration are personal:  one’s birthday and the anniversary of the death of a close relative.  On these days non-Jews would make idolatrous celebrations.  Interestingly, Jews did not traditionally celebrate birthdays because it was seen to be a non-Jewish custom.", 
            "The opinion in the previous section was that of Rabbi Meir, who held that pagans commemorate the anniversaries of all deaths.  The rabbis disagree with Rabbi Meir and hold that only deaths where the body and clothes were burned on a funeral pyre are celebrated by idolatrous acts.  If the body was not burned on the pyre then the day is not accompanied by idolatry and it is therefore permitted to conduct business with the non-Jew three days before.", 
            "As was previously stated it is forbidden to conduct business with non-Jews during the three days before the personal holidays mentioned in section two.  Here the mishnah lists pagan holidays that Jews can conduct business during the three days before and are only forbidden from doing so on the holiday itself.  These include the day that the non-Jew shaves his beard and lock of hair, which refers to a lock of hair grown at the back of one’s head and is shaved once a year; the day of return from a long trip by sea; the day that one is released from prison and the day in which one marries off one’s son and makes him a celebratory feast.",

Note that the mnemonic makes sense only if you remember the Mishnah. The odd thing about the Mishnah is that it lists the second holiday first.", 
            "This is an etymological story of the origins of Kalenda and Saturnalia. Some scholars also point to this story as the origin of why we light candles on Hannukah. Holidays around the winter solstice are often associated with fire, as a way of noting the beginning of the days getting longer, or to at least bring light to the darkest days of the year (in the northern hemisphere). There is also a sense here of cultural expropriation—your holidays were originally our holiday (in a sense) and you corrupted them. While there is of course a negative side to this phenomenon, the supremacist ideology it espouses, it also seems to me quite natural.", 
            "There is a dispute in rabbinic literature over when the world was created—Tishrei or Nisan. If the world was created in Tishrei, then Adam had never seen a long day, so we can understand why he was afraid. But if it was created in Nisan, then he’d already seen short days which grew longer and then began to grow shorter. Couldn’t he have figured out what was going on?<br>The (somewhat weak) answer is that he had not yet seen such short days.",

Don’t most bulls have them? Is there any reason to note that the bull has these features? The midrash reads this as a bull whose horns were created before its hooves. Now there can only have been one such bull in all of history—the first bull. And who else could have sacrificed the first bull—Adam. So Adam must be saying this verse. And why would Adam offer thanksgiving—because the sun went away and the came back again. It’s actually quite a remarkable piece of exegetical thinking.",

Why not say that he has transgressed only if he actually eats of the sacrifice? Rava reads this out of the verse, which says “and he will call you.” But I think that there is more than a midrash at work here. There is a deeper statement—even if the Jew does not actually transgress, the fact that he lives in an idolatrous environment, in a place where idolaters will be inviting him to participate in their celebratory meals, is already a ticket to transgression.",

And when can we assume that it is safe? The prohibition of participating in the meal begins from the time that the barley was thrown into the tub, in order to make beer.<br>We should note that this same exact sugya appears in Ketubot concerning reciting the special wedding blessings (today called the sheva berachot) When do we recite the special blessings and when do we not?

The Greeks concede to this argument and Rome and the Israelites win.",

Around the year 10 B.C.E. the sages made two famous decrees concerning impurity. The first is that anyone who walks anywhere outside of Israel becomes ritually impure. The second is that glass vessels are susceptible to impurity. The Torah does not list glass as a substance susceptible to impurity. The third is that around the year 30 B.C.E. the Sanhedrin, the ruling body in Israel, moved from its special chamber in the Temple to another area called “Hanut” which was also on the Temple Mount.",

But this change was not because of Roman persecution. It was because of Jewish corruption. There were so many Jewish murderers at that point that the courts could no longer properly try them. To avoid having to exile so many murderers, the court chose to go into a sort of “mini-exile.” For once their place of judgment had changed, they could no longer adjudicate capital crimes.",

We might therefore have thought that this is permitted. The Mishnah therefore needs to teach that it is not.",

Our mishnah extends this prohibition and prohibits a Jew from selling an animal to a non-Jew, lest the non-Jew use the animal for work on the Sabbath.  This is similar yet somewhat different from the issue which the mishnah discussed previously, selling potentially idolatrous objects to the non-Jew.  In both cases it is forbidden to sell something to a non-Jew.  However, in this case, Jews are not enjoined to prevent non-Jews from working on the Sabbath.  Rather Jews are prohibited from putting Sabbath observant animals into the position where they will have to break the Sabbath.  In other words this prohibition concerns the animal and not the non-Jew himself.<br>Not all animals are used for work.  Small animals, such as sheep and goats are not used for work.  Therefore in a place where it is customary to sell them to non-Jews it is permitted to do so.  In other places it was customary not to sell even small animals to non-Jews, lest the Jew become confused and sell them large animals, which is prohibited in all places.<br>It is forbidden in all places to sell large animals, such as oxen and horses, to non-Jews since they will be used to perform work on the Sabbath.  This prohibition includes calves and foals, even though they do not usually perform work.<br>Rabbi Judah allows one to sell injured animals to non-Jews since they are clearly being purchased for their meat and not in order to do work.<br>Ben Bateira allows the sale of a horse since horses are used for riding, which is not considered by the Rabbis to be work.  Pulling plows, a work performed by oxen is considered work.", 
            "The first clause of the mishnah implies that it is not actually prohibited to sell small animals to idolaters. But there is another mishnah that would prohibit selling any animal to them whatsoever, out of fear that they would have carnal relations with it.", 
            "Rav would say that the two prohibitions go together. If it is a place where it is forbidden to sell them an animal, then it is also forbidden to let them be alone with an animal. But in places where it is permitted to sell, it also permitted to let them alone with the animal."

            "There are several issues that may arise with selling a large animal to an idolater, but none of them seem to really make sense. We already said that idolaters do not engage in bestiality with their own animals, so that’s not a concern (phew!). Second, we might be concerned that they would make the animal work on Shabbat. But only animals owned by Jews must rest on Shabbat. Not animals owned by non-Jews. So what is the problem?", 
            "Theoretically, the prohibition of selling them a large animal may be because this could lead to loaning or renting them an animal. In such a case the Jew owns the animal and therefore there is a problem with the animal doing work.<br>But, halakhically speaking, when a person borrows or rents an animal he owns it (this is so he will be responsible for damages that happen to the animal). Therefore, the problem returns. Why shouldn’t a Jew sell his animal to an idolater?", 
            "Rami son of R. Yeba explains that this entire prohibition is because the Jewish owner might actually own the animal right when Shabbat begins. During the process of selling the animal, the Jew might give the owner a few moments to “try the animal out.” And then the animal would hear the owner’s voice and while carrying a load walk a bit. This is prohibited because one is not allowed to make his animal work on Shabbat—carrying is work. Lest this scenario occur, the rabbis prohibited selling to idolaters large animals that can carry a load.",

The Torah does not need to prohibit bringing an abomination into one’s own home—obviously that is prohibited. What it prohibits is to even allow a pagan to bring an idol into a home rented to him by a Jew. Thus renters do “own” what they are renting. Nevertheless, it is still prohibited to rent living quarters to an idolater (in the land of Israel).", 
            "Introduction<br>In yesterday’s sugya we learned that when one rents something he technically owns it. Obviously this does not mean that he does not have to give it back. What it means is that while the object is being rented, it technically belongs to him.",

Similarly, if a priest rents a cow from a priest, he may not feed it terumah. Again, renting does not constitute acquisition.",

This might lead one to rent or lend an animal or it might to letting the idolater try out the animal on erev Shabbat. Since the Jew still owns the animal, when it works on Shabbat the Jew is violating Shabbat.",

Even if the agent lets the idolater try it out on erev Shabbat, the animal will not come to the unfamiliar voice of the agent. And the agent will not lend or rent the animal out because it is not his. Furthermore, he would fear that the idolater would find a fault in the animal and then not buy it.",

But the sexual urges—well those have not gone away. But when they get to the brothel, the prostitutes run away. And one rabbi seems to have known that they would be protected from sin.

Beruriah made light of the Talmudic assertion that women are “light-minded.” To vindicate the Talmudic maxim, Rabbi Meir sent one of his students to seduce her.

It is likely that someone (I do not imagine Rashi himself) made this up as a mirror image of Beruriah’s sister. Beruriah is known elsewhere for being learned in matters of Torah. Someone may have invented this text as a way of deterring women from studying Torah. Such study, in the eyes of the author of the legend, will lead to women taking Talmudic learning lightly, for the tradition itself deprecates women. This will eventually lead them to become sexually licentious. Whereas Beruriah’s sister, who does not seem to be learned, cannot be seduced, Beruriah, the learned one, is seduced. Whereas Beruriah’s sister escapes both shame and death, Beruriah is shamed and as a result takes her own life.

Meir prohibits selling the tree before it is felled, because the non-Jew would not lose out by leaving the tree in the ground.

This is true of houses and even truer with regard to fields, for with fields there is the added problem of tithes. Once a Jew sells his field to a non-Jew the field’s produce is not liable for tithing. In this way, the sale reduces the holiness of the field. In Syria, which is adjacent to Israel and was conquered by David but is not considered fully a part of Israel, we can be slightly more lenient. Houses may be rented to non-Jews, but fields still may not, because the produce grown in Syria is still subject to tithes. Outside of the land, a Jew may sell houses, but he still may not sell fields, lest by habit he come to sell fields in the land of Israel as well.\n"

In Syria he allows the sale of houses and the renting of fields and outside of the land, both may be sold. Note that he is still consistent in that the rules are stricter with fields than with houses. The major difference is that he does not rule more strictly in cases that should be permitted (such as selling fields outside of the land) but were forbidden by Rabbi Meir lest one come to sell something that really should not be sold.",

Since the idolater will bring his idols into the house, this would violate the prohibition of allowing idols into one’s home. The idolater may only rent the house from the Jew to use for storage or other non-residential usage. [The Jerusalem Talmud rules that outside of the land of Israel it is permitted to sell or let houses to idolaters even for the purpose of residence. Although in this case too the idolater will bring idols into the house and seemingly thereby cause the Jew to violate the commandment in Deut. 7:26, the essential meaning of the verse is that it is forbidden for a Jew to bring idols into his own house.

There are two reasons not to sell them a field—1) It gives them a foothold in the land; 2) The produce becomes exempt from tithes. But there are also two reasons not to sell them a house—1) It gives them a foothold in the land; 2) The house becomes exempt from a mezuzah. So why is it more obvious with regard to a field than a house. R. Mesharsheya answers that there is no obligation for houses in Israel to have mezuzot. The obligation falls on the person, not on the house. ",

In principle, this should be permitted because this is not the land of Israel. But it is prohibited lest someone come to sell them houses in Israel itself. But the prohibition does not extend to letting them houses, because the prohibition of renting a house in Israel is itself only a safeguard against selling them houses. There is a principle that we do not make a decree not to do something lest someone do something else that is only prohibited by a decree and not by a principle. ",

Thus the rules concerning selling them land could apply in principle.

This implies that the red heifer has a high level of sanctity, equivalent to animals dedicated so that they may be sacrificed. For had its sanctity been lower, bestiality would not disqualify it. The problem is that we don’t generally consider the red heifer to have this degree of sanctity.",

The answer is that even two non-red hairs on the entire animal disqualify it. While it is evidently easy to produce a mostly red heifer, an exclusively red heifer is difficulty. So now comes the final and obvious difficulty—why do we need non-Jews to produce the red heifer. If all you need is the red cup trick, then we could just make our own red heifer? The answer is that the trick only works with certain breeds of cows, and evidently those breeds are possessed by the non-Jews.

Although this word too can be vocalized to be feminine, the fact that the end of the verse refers to maidens loving him proves that the one being spoken to is male.<br>Scholars have attempted to connect the meaning of this section with the previous topic of cheese. The “masculine” version of the verse gives priority to the written Torah, which would prohibit cheese only if it uses non-kosher ingredients, such as nevelah. R. Joshua is arguing that if cheese is prohibited, it must be prohibited on these grounds. The feminine version of the verse prioritizes the oral Torah, that created by the rabbis. Thus R. Ishmael believes that non-Jewish cheese is prohibited by rabbinic decree, like wine, as a means to keep Jews and non-Jews apart.",

            " The problem with the baraita is that if the pagan poured the wine in to complete the sealing of the pitch, the skin should be prohibited by the very act of the pagan pouring in the wine. Therefore R. Papa says that the pagan put in only the pitch, he did not pour the wine.", 
            "If the Jew is pouring the wine why do we need another Jew watching? The answer is that the Jew pouring may not notice the pagan make a quickie libation by pouring some wine out.", 
            "R. Zevid returns to the original wording of the baraita. The skin does not become prohibited when the pagan pours the first wine into it because this is like pouring water into mortar. He is making a vessel and will not at the same time libate.", 
            "There was a practice to pour a little bit of wine into salt containers to improve the flavor. R. Papi says that from R. Zevid’s statement we can learn that if the pagan poured some wine into the salt, the salt is not prohibited. But R. Ashi disagrees. When one puts wine in with pitch, the wine is lost and therefore the skin is not prohibited. But when it comes to the salt, the wine remains and therefore the salt is prohibited.", 
            "Introduction<br>This suyga discusses “kashering” wine-skins into which non-Jewish wine had been placed.", 
            "Tannaitic halakhah talks about kashering vessels that are of metal through heat, but wineskins cannot be torched (duh!). Thus the amoraim had to come up with a way of getting the non-kosher wine out of them, or at least the taste of the non-kosher wine. The solution was to fill them with water for three days, emptying and refilling the skin each day. ", 
            "At first the rabbis thought that this means of kashering works only for wine-skins that were first owned by Jews. These skins would have absorbed the kosher wine of the Jew and then absorbed the non-kosher wine. So the non-kosher wine would only be, in a sense, on the surface. But a statement by Resh Lakish teaches that this works for kashering any type of wine-skin, even skins originally owned by non-Jews.", 
            "R. Ashi rules when it comes to absorbing forbidden wine, even earthenware bottles may be koshered by the three days of water method.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s sugya discusses using wine vessels owned by non-Jews.", 
            "If the earthenware bottle was new and had not been lined with pitch, the Jew can use it because it does not absorb the pagan wine. But if it had been lined with itch in it, or had been used for some time, it will have absorbed the taste and it cannot be used. There are two interpretations of what this baraita means when it says that the Jew can put water into the earthenware bottle. Rashi says that this refers to the means by which the bottle is kashered, as we learned above. Other rishonim say that the baraita means that the Jew can put water into the earthenware bottle because the water will not take out the taste of the wine. According to Rashi, the Jew can also put in fish brine or murias (another type of brine) because the taste of the wine will not be perceived in the bottle. Other interpreters perceive this to be another way of kashering the bottle—the sharp taste of the brine will get out the taste of the wine.", 
            "The previous baraita ruled that if a Jew buys used earthenware wine bottles from an idolater, he may put brine and murias in them. Here the Talmud asks whether the baraita meant that if he put brine and murias into them, the brine is not ex post facto prohibited, but that he should not do so. Or is he completely allowed to do so. R. Zevid’s baraita states even more clearly that he is allowed to put in the brine “ab initio” or “lechatchila” in Hebrew. "

            "Introduction<br>Today’s sugya discusses koshering wine vessels used with non-Jewish wine. We should note that while the specific subject here is non-kosher wine, the same rules do apply to kashering vessels in which other prohibited substances had been used.", 
            "One can kasher earthenware wine vessels belonging to non-Jews by putting them back into the furnace. The heat will burn out any of the prohibited substance. R. Ashi adds that even if the pitch covering the inside of the vessel was only loosened and did not fall off, it is still permitted.", 
            "The amoraim debate whether instead of putting the earthenware jugs into the furnace (which probably could damage them), he can put lighted chips into the jugs and heat them up from the inside.<br>The final ruling is that this is not a valid means of kashering the jug.", 
            "According to Rava, the beer put in these wine jugs will nullify the taste of the wine and therefore it is permitted. According to R. Nahman and R. Judah it does not. As someone who knows quite a bit about beer, I must say that R. Nahman and R. Judah are usually correct. This is why some beer is allowed to age in wine barrels. It enriches the taste.", 
            "Ravina follows Rava and therefore he ruled that R. Hiyya could actually put beer into these vessels. R. Hiyya got confused and put wine in there. Rava was not concerned that by allowing people to use these vessels for beer, they would come to use them for wine. This case was just an accident.", 
            "Oops—filling the vessels with water was a good idea. Leaving them out in the sun, not such a good idea. R. Abba—maybe you could have had a bit more sympathy for R. Yitzchak?", 
            "Natron seems to be sodium carbonate. It was mined in places that also had alum. Vessels made of this material cannot be kashered for they would dissipate in water.", 
            "Since these wine vessels were not used that much, they may be simply rinsed with water and thereby koshered.", 
            "Introduction<br>Today’s section deals with various types of vessels, asking whether they absorb the taste of the wine put in them.", 
            "If a vessel is made in a way that it will not absorb the taste of the wine, then it need not be kashered. It can be rinsed out and used immediately.", 
            "When it is first used, the cup will absorb more of the taste of the wine placed in it. That is why there is a tendency here to agree that if the first usage, or maybe even the second usage, was with forbidden wine, the it is prohibited. But if a Jew uses it the first time, or the first two times, then the cup will absorb the permitted wine. Upon further use it will no longer absorb and therefore it is permitted.", 
            "White and black glazed vessels do not absorb the taste of the wine, but the green one’s might, so they are prohibited. And cracks will let the taste go into the vessel, so they are prohibited.", 
            "Introduction<br>This week’s daf begins with a discussion of which earthenware vessels may be kashered", 
            "This whole section is an extended difficulty on Meremar, a late Babylonian sage. Meremar allowed all glazed vessels that had been used with non-Jewish wine. He seemed to think that such vessels do not absorb. But when it came to vessels that had been used with hametz before Pesah, he ruled much more strictly, prohibiting all of them. He saw that they “sweat,” meaning they emit liquid when heated, and therefore he assumed that they also absorb. And once an earthenware vessel has absorbed taste, there is no way to “kasher” it. "
