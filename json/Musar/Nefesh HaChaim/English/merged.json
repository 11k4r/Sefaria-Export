                "\tIn truth it (having belief &amp; faith in Hash-m) is a great matter &amp; an awesome ability (Segulah) to remove &amp; nullify from oneself all judgments &amp; wills of others – that they will have no power or influence upon you whatsoever. When a person fixes in his heart to say “Is not Hash-m the true G-d &amp; besides Him, may He be Blessed, there is no power whatsoever in the world &amp; in all the worlds at all &amp; all is filled only with His simple Oneness, may His Name be Blessed.” And [then] he shall nullify with a complete nullification &amp; he will not be concerned about any power or will in the world. And he will attach &amp; cling the purity of his thoughts – only to the One Master, Blessed be He. Thus the Blessed One will give in his hands – to automatically nullify by himself all of the forces &amp; desires in the world that absolutely nothing will be able to affect him."
