                "[Concerning] the human being, it is proper/worthy/ra’uy that he should make himself  resemble /yitdameh his Possessor /qono, and then he will be [configured] in the secret of  the upper/exalted (supernal) form/tsurah, tselem and d’mut. For if he is alike in his body  and not in his actions, he makes the form [in which he was created] a lie. And they will  say of him: “A lovely form and (but) ugly deeds”. For the essence of the exalted/ `elyon  image and likeness is his actions. And what use would it be to him to be like the higher  form [in] the image of the structure of his limbs / d’mut tavnit eivarav, while in his  actions he does not make himself like his Creator? Therefore it is proper that he should  make [his actions] resemble the actions of Keter, the thirteen qualities of upper (divine)  compassion. "

                "‎<b>1. “Who is a powerful G-d like You”</b> This teaches that G-d is a shamed King, bearing ‎incalculable shame. Without doubt, nothing is hidden from His oversight, and there is no moment ‎when a person is not nourished and supported by the higher force that flows upon him, so that ‎there was never a person who sinned against G-d without G-d, at that very instant, flowing into ‎him his existence and his ability to move his limbs. Even though this person sins with that force, G-‎d does not withhold it at all. G-d endures this shame, flowing into the person the power for his ‎limbs to move, and the person using that power at that moment for sin and iniquity, and to anger ‎G-d, and G-d endures it patiently … Even though He has the power to withdraw that flowing force, ‎and He should have said, “Since you sin against Me, sin with your own strength, not with Mine,” He ‎does not withhold good from a person for this. Instead, He endures the shame and flows strength ‎and gives a person of His goodness... This is the meaning of, “Who is a powerful G-d like You” – You ‎are a powerful G-d, giving and benefiting, and a powerful G-d, with strength to take revenge and ‎take back what is Yours, and yet You bear and are shamed until the person repents.  This is a ‎trait one must follow, meaning patience and being shamed, even to this extent, and yet not to ‎withhold one’s aid from the recipient.‎"
