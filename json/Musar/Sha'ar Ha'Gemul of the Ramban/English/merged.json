        "...Our rabbis taught (Rosh Hashanah 16b): \"Three books are opened on Rosh Hashanah - one for thoroughly righteous people, one for thoroughly evil people, and one for the average people. Thoroughly righteous people are inscribed and sealed immediately for life; thoroughly evil people are inscribed and sealed immediately for death; average people remain undetermined for between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. If they merit it, they are inscribed for life; if they do not merit it, they are inscribed for death.\" That which the sages said of righteous people -  that they are inscribed for life - or evil people - that they are inscribed for death - is not said of righteous people who have no sins or evil people who have no merits, for many righteous people die immediately, and many evil people live long lives in serenity."
