            "One who misleads his fellow, saying that he did something good, or didn't do something bad, is in the eyes of the sages of Israel a more serious sin than robbing gentiles. Lying lips [bear] a great guilt, and we are obligated to stay within the parameters of truth, because truth is one of the foundations of the [health of the] soul."
