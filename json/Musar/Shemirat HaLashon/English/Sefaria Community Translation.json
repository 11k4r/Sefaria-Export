                "It is written (Proverbs 21:23), \"One who keeps an eye on his mouth and tongue protects his life from trouble.\" In order to comprehend chaperoning the mouth and tongue and preventing life trouble which the Scripture defines, even more than all other ideas, that the perfect man needs to watch during the days,  look in the basic commentaries. And I too shall speak over my part which Hashem has granted me, and with this we shall also understand that which is written (Psalms 34:13), \"Whoever is a man who desires life and covets [his] days in order to perceive benevolence, shield your tongue from evil\" etc. "
