                "<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai, etc.:</b> (I will begin the commentary on \"Avot\" of our great, pious and holy rabbi, Rabbi Yonah the son of Rabbi Avraham, may he be remembered for blessing.) Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 30a) \"One who wishes to be pious should fulfill the words of Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), and [some] said about it, the words of Damages (Nezikin)\". And since a person ascends the steps of piousness by doing one of these matters, they placed [Avot] in the Order of Damages. And even though they also said to fulfill the words of Blessings (Berakhot) which is in the order of Seeds (Zeraim); because it speaks of the blessings on seeds and fruits, they placed it in that order (Editor's note: See what Midrash Shmuel wrote about this in the name of Rabbi Yosef Nachmias, may his memory be blessed). Furthermore, since it is the teachings of the Sanhedrin, they placed it in the order of the laws (of Damages); and so [too], all the sages mentioned [here] until Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai are all from the Sanhedrin. ", 
                "<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> Both the written Torah and the oral Torah. As the Torah was given with its explanation. As if it were not so, it would be impossible to understand [its contents]. As behold, it is written (Leviticus 19:13), \"do not rob\" - and all of the [laws of] damages are within this negative commandment, and they themselves are the Torah that was received by Moshe at Sinai, even though they were not written. And it is also written (Deuteronomy 17:8), \"between a blood and a blood and between a judgement and a judgement and between an infection and an infection\" - and many of the sightings of blood and many of the various judgments and so many of the infections are known to us by the transmission [of this information]... And they are not explained [in writing] because it is not allowed to be written. And it is written (Exodus 24:12), \"and I will give you the stone tablets and the Torah and the commandment\" - \"Torah\" is the written Torah; \"and the commandment\" is the oral Torah. it comes out that you say that every commandment that He gave to Moshe at Sinai, was given with its explanation. And that which is written is what is called the written Torah and the explanation is what is called the oral Torah. And Moshe learned it from the mouth of the Mighty One.  ", 
                "<b>and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> As it is stated (Exodus 33:11), \" but his attendant, Joshua son of Nun, a youth, would not stir out of the tent.\"", 
                "<b>and Yehoshua to the Elders:</b> As it is stated (Joshua 24:31), and all the days of the elders who had length of days after Joshua.\"", 
                "<b>and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly:</b> And that is Ezra and his group. And [some of] the prophets of the Second Temple were in that group, as they said in Yevamot 16a, \"Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said, 'When Chaggai said these three things, he was sitting on this mortar.'\" Hence the prophets of the Second Temple were there after the destruction, since Haggai the prophet was there. And the men of the Great Assembly transmitted it to the men of their generation. And the sages [transmitted it] to their children after them in each and every generation. And the transmission was from one sage to another, until all of the sages of Israel gathered and a suggestion was given from all of their mouths to write down the oral Torah. And [so] they wrote and sealed the Talmud, and afterwards nothing was added to it and nothing was taken away from it. And that generation also transmitted it to the Geonim and the transmission was from one Gaon to another, one rabbi to another - until this day. ", 
                "<b>They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment:</b> They said [this] to teachers of legal decisions and decisors of legal decisions and decisors of litigation; that they should not rely on the first thought, but rather upon great deliberation and incisive investigation, so that they not err in their evaluation. As a man who is quick to make a decision is called a sinner - and even though he thought he was saying the truth, it is not [considered] accidental but rather is [considered] to be close to volitional, since he did not put it into his heart to say, the quick hearts do not understand to know. As error is found in all men, as the rabbis say (Avot 4:13), \" Be careful in study, for an error in study is considered an intentional transgression.\" And about this matter, Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 26:12), \"If you see a man who thinks himself wise, there is more hope for a dullard than for him.\" And it is as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Avot 4:7), \"One who is nonchalant about giving legal decisions is an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit.\" Therefore, it is incumbent upon a man who makes legal decisions to go back and forth on the matter and let his thought ripen and to hold on to it; as the matter that they said (Sanhedrin 35a) [that] we should ripen a judgement, as through ripening and deliberation, he adds reasoning to his reasoning and sharpness to his sharpness, until he judges a completely true judgement. As he will see to say with the second thought that which he did not see with the first. And about this matter, Asaf stated (Psalms 73:21), \"As my heart ripened and my kidneys were silent,\" which is to say [that] after my heart has ripened and been sharp with wisdom and with my kidneys, I have been silent and have refined my understanding to know. As without this, I have not known, and this is my portion. (And as) it is after it, \"I was a dolt, without knowledge; I was brutish toward You.\" And the reason [they] said, <b>\"Be deliberate in judgment,\"</b> is in order to warn about litigation more than other legal decisions, as they are fundamental in the knowledge of Him, may He be blessed and elevated; and as Yirmiyahu the prophet stated (Jeremiah 9:23), \"ponder and know Me, for I am the Lord who makes kindness, justice, and equity in the world; for in these I delight, declares the  Lord.\" And how can a man a ponder and know God, as it is not possible? However with this have we known Him, by dong judgment and justice, since God does these. And that is what is stated (Jeremiah 22:16), \"He judged for the poor and needy— then all was well. That is truly knowing Me, declares the  Lord.\" And it is written in another place (Micah 6:8), \"And what does the Lord require of you? Only to do justice and to love kindness,\" since judgments are a pillar of the Torah. And from them the world is made firm, as is said in the Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 30 3), \"It is written in front of The Ten Commandments, 'and they will judge the people at all times' (Exodus 18:22). And after the Ten Commandment, it is written, 'And these are the laws' (Exodus 21 1). There is a parable [about this] concerning a matron that was walking along the way and her armed guards were walking in front of her and behind her.\"", 
                "<b>raise up many disciples:</b> As per the opinion of Beit Hillel. [This is] like the matter that we have learned (The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan 2:9), \"Beit Shammai say, 'We only teach a student who is fit, modest, proper and who fears Heaven, as it is stated (Job 20:26), \"All (darkness) waits for his treasured ones.\" And Beit Hillel say, 'We teach everyone: One hundred so that ten good ones will come out from them; and ten so that two will come out of them; and two, \"since you do not know which will be proper, this one or that one or if they will both be equally good.\" And so was there a story of Hillel, who brought together all of his students and said to them, 'Are all of you here?' They said [back] to him, 'Yes.' One of his students said to him, 'All of them are here except the smallest one.' He said to them, 'Let the small one come, who the generation in the future will follow.' And they brought Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai. Behold that one should not push off the small ones for the bigger ones, since the kids will become goats.\" And about this matter the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Yevamot 62b), \"'Sow your seed in the morning, and don’t hold back your hand in the evening' (Ecclesiastes 11:6), - if you have raised disciples in your youth, raise disciples in your old age.\" Behold that the multiplication of disciples is a very good thing and a merit to the teacher.", 
                "<b>and make a fence for the Torah:</b> As the matter that is stated (Leviticus 18:30), \"And you shall guard My guarding\"; which is to say, make a guarding for my guarding. And a fence is a great thing and it is praiseworthy to make a fence for the commandments so that the one who fears the word of God not stumble in them. Hence one who observes the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed - which are the fences for the commandments of the Torah - has shown more love for [this] fear than one who does the commandment itself. As the doing of the commandments does not prove fear like the one who observes the fences, since he is careful from the start not to come to error. However, the one who does the commandment but does not observe the fence shows us that if it is good in his eyes to do the commandment, [yet] it is not bad in his eyes if he errs in it; and that he is not concerned about the fear that he will make a breach in it, and 'one who makes a breach will be bitten by a snake.' Behold that the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed, are pillars and 'trees' in the fear of Heaven; which is a foundation of the world and a fundamental principle of virtue. And all of the commandments are appetizers for it, as they said in the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1), \"'For your love is more delightful than wine' (Song of Songs 1:2) - the words of the scribes are more beloved than the wine of Torah.\""

                "<b>Shimon the Righteous was from the remnants of the Great Assembly.</b> And he was a high priest, as they said in Tractate Tamid 21 (Yoma 69a) that he had gone out dressed with the priestly garments in front of Alexander [the Great] and [Alexander] went down and bowed before him. His servants said to him, \"Our master, A king like you should bow down to this Jew?\" He said [back] to them, \"I see the image of this one in war and I am victorious.\"", 
                "<b>He would say, \"On three things the world stands\":</b> This means to say that because of these things the world was created. As below (Avot 1:18), it states, \"On three the things the world subsists,\" and they are not those that it mentions here. Hence, we need to explain that when they said \"stands,\" it means that the world was created for them, since they are the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. This means to say that the world was created for His creatures that in the future would fulfill His will in front of Him through these things. And these three are a great pillar, such that on account of them, we are able to get to all of the [other] things that the sages, may their memory be blessed, said that the world stands because of them.", 
                "<b>\"On the Torah\":</b> As it stated about it (as it is stated) (Proverbs 11:27), \"He who seeks what is good pursues what is pleasing.\" And good is only Torah, and because of it the world was created, as it is stated (Jeremiah 33:25), \"Were it not for My covenant, night and day[, etc.]. And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, said, (Proverbs 8:22), \"The Lord created me at the beginning of His course, as the first of His works of old\" - I was created before the whole world and because of me, all of the creations were created - in order to observe me. ", 
                "<b>\"on the service\":</b> As the Holy One, blessed be He, chose Israel from all of the nations and the Land of Israel from all of the lands, and He chose Jerusalem from all of the Land of Israel and He chose Zion from Jerusalem, as it is stated (Psalms 132:13), \"As the Lord chose Zion, He desired it for His habitation.\" And He chose the House of Choice from everything for the sake of the service, about which it is written, \"desire\" - as it states (Leviticus 1:3), \"desirous in front of God.\" Behold that because of the service the whole world was created. Then, due to our sins, the Temple was destroyed and the service was annulled. And prayer is now for us in its place, as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Taanit 2a), \"'And to serve him with all your hearts' (Deuteronomy 11:13) - what service is there in the heart, one should say this is prayer.\" And this is what it states (Psalms 51:17), \"Lord, open my lips,\" as King David said this verse about the sin of Batsheva which was volitional, and one cannot bring a sacrifice for volitional sins. And about this he stated (Psalms 51:18), \"Since You do not want me to bring sacrifices; You do not desire burnt offerings.\" Had I been able to bring a sacrifice to atone for myself, I would have brought [it]. Now that I cannot, 'Lord, open my lips and let my mouth say your praise,' and accept my prayer in place of a sacrifice and let it atone me for my sin. Also for us that do not have a sacrifice to atone for us - not accidental sins and not volitional sins - 'Lord, open my lips' and accept our prayers in place of the sacrifices.  ", 
                "<b>\"and on acts of lovingkindness\"</b> As the matter that they said (Sukkah 49b), \"Acts of lovingkindness are greater than charity (<i>tsedekah</i>); since lovingkindness is both with the poor and with the wealthy but charity is only with the poor. Great is lovingkindness since it is both with one's body and with one's money, but charity is only with one's money.\"  And this is what they said, (Bava Batra 9a), \"One who gives a small coin to a poor man is blessed in six ways and one who comforts him with words is blessed in eleven.\" And pertinent to acts of lovingkindness is to inspect the poor and to make a distinction between the good and the bad and to give preference to the modest and those that fear God over others who are not like them (even if we must give charity to all). And it is like Yirmiyahu, peace be upon him, stated (Jeremiah 18:23), \"let them be made to stumble before You; act against them in Your hour of wrath!\" - even in the time that they do charity, make them stumble that they should give it in the incorrect place. And acts of lovingkindness are even to the wealthy, to lend them money at a time when it is not found in their hand and to give them advice, as King Shlomo said, (Proverbs 27:9), \"Oil and incense gladden the heart, but the sweetness of a friend is better than one’s own counsel.\" [This] is to say, just like oil and incense gladden the heart, so [too] does one 's friend become delighted by personal advice; and when he gives him good advice, he is gladdened by it. And this trait of kindness brings God's satisfaction in front of Him, and for it was the world created - in order to do it. And about it Shlomo said in his wisdom (Proverbs 14:34), \"Righteousness exalts a nation; Sin is a reproach to any people\" - and adjacent to it, \"The king favors a capable servant\" - the will of the Holy One, blessed be He is only for Israel, who investigate [how] to do the things that are desirable in front of Him."

                "<b>\"Rather be as servants who are serving the master in order not to receive a reward\":</b> (Editor's note: In my opinion, here there should be the words, \"And it is difficult according to this textual variant.\") Since a person should not do the commandment with the understanding that he will not receive a reward for them. But rather the [correct] textual variant is \"not in order to receive a reward\" - that he should not do the commandments for the sake of the reward, even though he should think that there will be recompense for his service. However, it appears to me that the variant of the books is the main one [that we should follow]: As we find such service among people, such that a purchased slave is obligated to do service without receiving reward. So too, a man must serve God in order not to receive a reward, but rather because of the kindness that He has already performed for him. And also due to the greatness of the Master, that He is fitting for this, and this is the service of God - may He be blessed and elevated - from love, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:5), \"And you shall love the Lord.\" And what is complete service among people? One who wants to serve his friend because of his love for him from earlier days, and even if he knows that he will not give him a reward. And [with] this type of love should a person love the service of God. And therefore, [the Mishnah] placed it adjacent to the matter of fear and stated,",

As if they said it with the one that will be permissible for him tomorrow - and it appears to him like 'bread in his basket' - all the more so with another woman, whom the impulse desires, as the matter that it stated (Proverbs 9:17), \"stolen waters are sweet.\" But it appears to be explained according to its simple meaning, \"They so stated with his wife,\" not to ever accustom her to [many] words, so that she not be found with him every day. As a man should not be with his wife for his pleasure, but [rather] to fulfill the commandment; so as to distinguish between man and beast, as they said in Tractate Berakhot 22a concerning a man with a nocturnal emission, \"So that they not be with their wives like chickens.\" And that is the trait of separation which brings one to the highest levels, as we say (Avodah Zarah 20b), \"Separation brings to purity.\"",

And this is what Shlomo - peace be upon him - stated (Ecclesiastes 7:26), \"I find woman more bitter than death; she is all traps, her heart is snares and her hands are fetters.\" This means to say that death removes him from the world - from the small life of the world - but woman destroys his soul for ever and ever. Behold, 'she is more bitter than death.' \"She is all traps and snares\": When a man observes a woman, he is caught in her net, which is her trap, and he cannot escape from her. As the man sees that which his heart desires and he does not see what will happen to him from her in the end of days. As the lyricist (R.

As even if his friend is not more pious than he and there are times that he does what is not in order. [Yet it is only] when he derives pleasure from something that he does the sin, but it is not his desire and his will that his friend do it - as he derives no enjoyment from this. And it is like they said (Kiddushin 63b), \"And a man will not sin if it is not for himself.\" It comes out that both of them will repent, each one according to the word of his friend. And the third is regarding advice that he can take, that he be 'more than a city for help' in all of his affairs and to take good counsel from him and to be his confidant. Since he is his ally, he will not reveal [his secrets] to others so as not to confound his plan - and not even to those that appear to him to be friends; for is the appearance of love evident on their faces? And about this Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 15:22), \"Plans are foiled for want of counsel, but they succeed through many advisers.\" And that which he said, <b>\"acquire for yourself a friend\"</b> with an expression of [acquisition] (euphemism) is [to say] that if he does not find him for free, he should acquire him with his money and expend his assets in order to get to a good friend; or that he should acquire him with words of appeasement and with a soft way of talking. And [so] he should not be exacting about his words and he should tolerate the words of his mouth; even when he says something against him, he should not return a response. As without this, he will not keep [the friendship], since the opinions [of people] are different. And sometimes he will seek something, [but] his friend who is like himself will say, \"See, I do not [consider] this to be fit.\" And if he doesn't [listen to his friend] (he will certainly pass him up), the [friendship] will unravel. And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 17:9), \"He who seeks love covers errors, but he who harps on a matter alienates a leader.\" He meant to say, one who covers when his friend errs, seeks love - as through this, their love is preserved, as he tolerates his errors. But if he harps about the matter with his friend, he speaks against him and repeats it and says, \"See what this one said; what he said about me, he 'alienates the leader' - he(certainly) alienates his leader from him, meaning to say, his friend.

                "<b>\"and judge every person as meritorious\":</b> This is speaking about a person about whom we do not know if he is righteous or if he is evil; or if we know that he is a moderate person, sometimes doing evil and sometimes doing good. And if he does something that can make us judge him unfavorably and [also] judge him favorably in our understanding - or even if, (towards) according to what appears, it leans more towards the side of guilt - if he can judge him favorably from one aspect of the matter, he should say, \"His intentions were good.\" But these words are not [applicable] to the completely righteous or the completely evil. As with the righteous person, even with an action that is completely evil and leans toward guilt in every aspect, we should judge him favorably and say, \"'It was a mistake that came out from the hand of the ruler,' and behold he regretted and observed [it] and [already] requested forgiveness.\" And it is like the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 19a), \"If you see a Torah scholar who sinned at night, do not ruminate about him during the day, lest he has repented. 'Lest' comes into your mind? But rather, I will say he certainly repented.\" The explanation of  \"'Lest' comes into your mind?\" is that since he is a Torah scholar and up until now, no corrupt thing has come to his hand; he certainly repented right away. You behold [from here that] one should never judge the perfectly righteous person unfavorably. And about him there is no reason to say,  \"judge every person as meritorious.\" And he also did not speak about the completely evil person. Even if his actions are completely good and it is not evident to be concerned about him regarding an angle of iniquity, a person should judge him unfavorably and say, \"He did it on the surface 'and his inside is not like his outside.'\" And it is like it is stated (Proverbs 26:25), \"Though he be fair-spoken do not trust him, for seven abominations are in his heart.\" And so [too] wrote Rambam, may his memory be blessed. And about this Shlomo stated in his wisdom (Proverbs 21:12), \"The righteous one observes the house of the wicked man; he subverts the wicked to the bad.\" He meant to say, people think that because the righteous do not know how to do evil, [hence] they do not recognize they ways of the evil - as they do not understand those that do it. And the matter is not like this, as 'the righteous one observes the house of the wicked,' and knows and recognizes and monitors the evil of his ways more than other people who know [about it], but don't pay attention to it. \"He subverts the wicked to the bad\" - when the righteous person sees the action of the evildoers which appear to be in a good path, he subverts it and pushes it towards his judgment to say that he has done wrong - since he did not intend [to do] a commandment, but rather to place himself among those assumed to be good.

For this, it shall be upon you.' \"As his time comes suddenly\" and you will not be able to escape for your life. \"And the doom of both, who can foreknow,\" meaning to say, the doom of the king's hater and the doom of the hater of the Holy One, blessed be He.

And even when a man toils greatly to do what is straight in the eyes of God, a man only accomplishes a small part of what he is obligated to do.\" And this is what is stated (Psalms 103:14), \"For He knows our impulse; He is mindful that we are dust.\" Since were it not that He made the evil impulse [powerful] in man - even without his working hard and pursuing the commandments - he would do many of them.

And if he does not fertilize it and plow it, nothing will come out of it.

And so [too] when a person is still young, it is easy for him to be on a good path and to turn from evil, but when he grows old with his evil, it is difficult in his eyes to leave it, as it is written (Proverbs 22:6), \"Teach a lad according to his way; also when he will grow old, he not swerve from it.\" And it is [also] written (Deuteronomy 20:19), \"since a man is a tree of the field.\" And also because repentance in old age is not full repentance. Since at that time, the impulse is not strong and desire is benign and the soul does not enjoy - and he does not desire - sinful pleasures. And this is the reason for his repentance.

Whichever [path] that is [itself] praiseworthy for the person adopting [it], And praiseworthy to him from [other] people:</b> When the commandments are done, the Holy One, blessed be He, is made praiseworthy through them and that is true praiseworthiness for people. And therefore, one should choose this path for himself.", 
                "<b>And praiseworthy to him from [other] people:</b> That he do the commandments in their [appropriate] time, as it is stated (Proverbs 15:23), \"and how good is a thing in its time.\" As he can do [them] in a time that is not right in the eyes of the creatures and it will not attain praiseworthiness from them. And that is not doing the complete commandment; as the matter that the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 63a), \"Anyone who does a commandment according to its statement nullifies even a decreed judgment of seventy years, as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 8:4), 'Inasmuch as a king’s command is authoritative, and none can say to him, “What are you doing?,” and it is written after it, 'One who obeys the commandment will not know evil.'\" He should also beautify the commandments - a beautiful lulav (palm frond), a beautiful talit (prayer shawl), a beautiful scroll of the Torah, tefillin and the like, in a manner that people will praise it and complement him about them. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, explained this mishnah [to be] about character traits, to [follow] the middle path which is the choice path and is praiseworthy for the one that adopts it. As it establishes 'a pure heart' in a person and 'renews a proper spirit in his soul.' And \"it is praiseworthy to him from [other] people,\" in that the creations learn to act well and properly from him. [For example] with the trait of generosity, 'A miser will not be called noble,' and also a spendthrift will see evil. And [so] who is the generous one? One who - even though he loves money and saves it very well - consults generously and orders his spending so that he will have enough 'to do the good and the straight' in the place that is fitting to give to. So [too] there is no trait under the [sun] that [is proper] except besides the middle path. And [these traits] are praiseworthy for the person adopting it, and praiseworthy to him from [other] people (but [not] if he does [too] little or [too] much).", 
                "<b>And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one, for you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments:</b> Even though the punishments for sins are explained to us - as some of them are with excision (<i> karet</i>) and some with death at the hands of Heaven, excision being that he and his seed are cut off whereas death at the hands of Heaven is only that he is cut off, and there are some sins that get the four death penalties meted out by the court, and there are negative commandments that bring forty lashes, and the one who transgresses the rabbinic laws gets rabbinic lashes for rebellion - but the reward of the [positive] commandments is not explained to us, not for the light ones and not for the weighty ones. And the sages, may their memory be blessed, demonstrated [this with] a metaphor (Pesikta Rabbati 23), \"To what is this similar? To a king who gave an orchard for his servants in which to plant trees. And if he made known to them the giving of reward [of the different trees], they would have all toiled on those trees that have a large reward, and it would come out that the orchard would be missing the other [trees]. So [too], were the Holy One, blessed be He, to make known the giving of reward for the [different] commandments, [people] would do the weighty ones that have a large reward and leave over the light ones that have a smaller reward, and a person would be incomplete in the commandments.\" And for this reason, one should not be lenient about the commandments, and his soul should hold them [all] dear to do, since he does not know which are the light ones and which are the weighty ones. But our rabbi (R. Yehuda HaNassi, the author of this mishnah) excelled in his words and gave a stronger reason than this and said that \"you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments\" [as to] how much it is - as even the reward of a light commandment is highly elevated. And you should be careful not to lose such a great gain, like the matter that they said (Chullin 142a), \"'If you chance upon the nest of a bird in front of you, etc.' (Deuteronomy 22:6) - and if for a commandment as light as a small coin the Torah says, 'in order that it will be good for you' in the world that is completely good 'and that you will have length of days' in the world that is completely long, all the more is it so for the weighty commandments of the Torah.\"", 
                "<b>Also, weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it:</b> As if your heart will whisper something to say, \"How will I do this and lose my money with this and that\"; you can also say to it, \"Because there will be a great reward for it, two thousand times the loss.\" And with this, it will not prevent you from glory.", 
                "<b>And [weigh] the gain [that may be obtained through the committing] of a transgression against the loss [that may be sustained] by [committing] it:</b> 'Lest there be in your heart the base thought to say,' \"There is great reward in doing this sin and I will gain very much with it and I will have great pleasure; and how can I not do it?\" - guard yourself and consider that which you will lose from it in the end of days, as it is many times over that which you will gain now. And the future pain is much longer and bigger than the temporary pleasure.

And it is a wonder why he counted them as three things, as the three of them are [really] one thing. As this is [all] just saying that God knows everything and will pay back in the future according to the deed. And [so] what is this calculation, as they are all one matter? Hence, it appears that the explanation is that this matter is a metaphor: that in the same way that when he is standing in front of kings and in front of ministers and sages and men of repute, he would be embarrassed to do things that are not done and from saying things that are not good; so [too] should he think at all times as if he is in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, in the same way as a man stands in front of his companion. And with this, he will guard his way - also his mouth and his tongue - from sinning, and 'from anguish to his soul.'  And that is why he said, \"Know what is above you: An Eye that sees, and an Ear that hears,\" and counted them as two things - an Eye that sees corresponding to the deed and an Ear that hears corresponding to the speech. And God forbid - it is not a real eye nor a [real] ear. But rather, he means to say that there is no deed that is hidden from in front of Him nor one that is unknown to Him. And the third thing is \"and all your deeds are written in a book\" - meaning to say that there is no forgetting in front of His throne of glory. And behold, all things are ordered in front of Him, as if they were written in a book, to pay their doers according to their actions and according to the deeds of their hands in the end of days. And if a person puts into his heart the payback that will be given to him, he will prevent himself from doing [sins].

Hence one should be involved in Torah - which saps the strength of a man - and also in his work for the sake of his livelihood. And he should never be idle, lest he indulge 'and his heart becomes haughty, to forget the Lord,' as the matter that is stated (Deuteronomy 32:15), \"And Yeshurun will grow fat and kick.\"",

Also when the money from the gifts runs out, he will become a thief or a kidnapper (or gambler) and will bring 'home loot taken from the poor' so that he not die of hunger. And when a person reaches these traits, his spirit knows no restraint and he will not rest and not be still until he transgresses all of the commandments that are stated in the Torah, since 'one sin brings along [another] sin.'

And even if the king  wants to do him honor, it is only in his hand to surely take the vengeance of God and to 'afflict the one that the Lord would love to chastise.'

And the correct [reason that the question was asked] is because there are several good traits the opposite of which are not bad;  like the trait of piety which is a very great virtue - but if one is not pious, no bad will happen. About this, he said \"a bad eye\" - meaning to say, that a person not say stinginess is not bad since he doesn't extort or rob from his fellow.

Yet it will be lacking in his heart at the end of days - as the little that is lacking will be a big lack, as Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated in his wisdom (Ecclesiastes 10:1), \"Dead flies turn the perfumer’s ointment fetid and putrid; so a little folly outweighs massive wisdom.\" He meant to say [that] just like a fly - which is a small thing - completely destroys a very important thing, the perfumer's ointment; so too is a little foolishness to the glory of a sage and an honored man. As the trait of miserliness causes a man to be empty (<i>beliaal</i>) of the good traits. [It is] like we find with Naval the Karmelite: Because he said (I Samuel 25:11), \"Should I take my bread and my water, etc.,\" it stated about him (Samuel I 25:25), \"Please, my lord, pay no attention to that empty man, Naval.\"",

Since at the time that he borrowed, he should have thought and seen if he would be able to pay up when the time of payment would come.

And this is what it says here, \"is like borrowing from the Omnipresent\" - meaning to say that he not think that since I don't have with what to pay and I was already brought to court and they did not find anything for me to pawn and I left innocent, what is my transgression and what is my sin? And the matter to you is as if you borrowed from the Omnipresent, blessed be He; and if you are exempt from the laws of man, you are nonetheless not [exempt] from the laws of Heaven. And you will not be exempt on account of people [as] the case will be between you and God. Since when you have a case for a loan with people, you are not exempt - even if people have exempted you. What is the reason? As it is stated (Psalms 37:21), \"The evildoer borrows and does not repay; the righteous has compassion and gives\" - meaning to say, that since he borrowed and does not repay, he is an evildoer. And [this is so] even though he doesn't have [with what to pay], as it was up to him to investigate with what he would repay from the beginning. But the righteous one is compassionate and gives what he has to give, giving it [so that he can still] repay. Since he is nonetheless careful from the beginning with that with which he can repay. And even though we do not hold it as a credit for the man who repays his obligation; for the righteous one who has 'grace on his lips' in his way in the world, we hold it as a credit when he returns people's money and they become his friends on account of their money.

And through this, he will have every illness and ailment, and this is that which is stated (Proverbs 13:25), \"The righteous man eats to satisfaction, but the belly of the wicked is lacking.\" As the stomach is only able to digest what it can hold; and when one eats and fills it until the palate no [longer] desires to eat, he makes the belly lack and destroys it - as the destruction of the belly is its lack. But the righteous person who eats to the satisfaction of his soul and only to remove his hunger, he sustains the body which the soul loves [in order] 'to do the good and the straight in the eyes of the Lord.' And the enlightened ones will understand. How is it [with] sitting, getting up and walking? There is no need to say that 'he not sit in a gathering of scorners and not stand in a place of sinners and not walk in the counsel of evildoers,' [but] even to sit in the council of the straight and to stand in the path of the righteous and to walk in the path of the innocent - if he did it for his own benefit and to fulfill the wants of his body and its desires, it is not praiseworthy; but [rather] only if he did [it] for the sake of Heaven. How is it [with] laying down? There is no need to say that at a time that he can be involved in Torah [study] and in the commandments and [instead] arouses himself to sleep to enjoy himself, that it is not fit to do so. But even at a time when he is weary and needs to sleep in order to rest from his weariness - if he does it for the benefit of his body, it is not praiseworthy; but [rather] only if it is to fulfill the needs of his body in order that he be able to serve his Creator and to give sleep to his eyes and rest to his body, for the needs of health and that his mind not break down in Torah [study] from the weariness. With sexual relations, there is no need to say that he not commit a sin. But even at the appointed time stated in the Torah, if he does [it] for the sake of the benefit to his body or to achieve his desire - behold, this is disgraceful. But even if he intended [it] so that he have sons that will serve him and fill his place, it is not praiseworthy; but rather only if it is that he have sons to serve the Omnipresent, may He be blessed, or that he intended to have sexual relations to fulfill the appointed time stated in the Torah - like who one pays off a debt to his creditor. How is it [with] speaking? There is no need to say [not] to recount evil speech and foulness of the mouth and similar to them. But even in recounting words of wisdom, his intention needs to be for the service of his Creator or for something that will bring him to His service. The principle of the matter is that a person is obligated to put his eyes and his heart to his ways, and to weigh all of his deeds in the scales of his mind. And when he sees that something brings him to the service of his Creator, may He be blessed, he should do it; and if not, he should separate from it. And so wrote Rambam, may his memory be blessed."

Another explanation: When a person's fear of sin precedes his wisdom, it comes out that when he studied, it guarded him and strengthened him to go on the path that he is accustomed to from many days; since when he fears sin and his heart adds great love for it and desires to add to it, it strengthens him to do that to which he is accustomed.

If he doesn't know the Torah and the commandments; when he needs to do these actions, upon what [basis] will he do them? Rather this mishnah was speaking according to a fit, good and accepted advice for the one who doesn't know - so that he not destroy his soul. [That advice is] that he accept upon himself to do all of the things that the sages tell him to do, and not to veer from them to the right or to the left when he knows them.

And immediately when he accepts upon himself this acceptance with a full heart and a desiring soul, he brings [himself] reward, as if he [did] all of the commandments. And according to this approach, they said, \"Anyone whose actions are more plentiful than his wisdom,\" [as] even for the one who does not know and does not do, they are called actions - since he has reward for them as if he did them, on account of [his] acceptance.

However they accepted upon themselves first to do all that He would command them and [that] they would understand; and they received reward from it immediately as if they had done them. \"And anyone whose wisdom is more plentiful than his actions, etc.\" - that he should not say, \"I will study this law and [then] I will practice it, I will study the whole Talmud and [then] I will practice it.\" If he says like this, his wisdom will not endure - as one needs to perfect the traits first and then his wisdom will endure."

And he should not say, \"[I have] a thousand kor - how can I give a hundred to the tithe, and they are worth much.\" As God, may He be blessed and elevated, is trustworthy to pay him all that he gave and to multiply the reward.

And he distances himself from the roots of [the pleasures] and brings himself near to the fundamentals (literally, trunks) of the soul and its foundation. And [hence] he is close to the service of the Creator, may He be blessed. How is it with food? One who eats a little in order to live that he be healthy to study much Torah and to do great service in the service of God. And he drinks to fill his thirst and not to get drunk and [so] not 'expose himself within his tent.' And that which he only has sexual relations to fulfill the commandment, behold this is from the way of abstinence - as his intention is not to enjoy from the world. And there is also a second benefit: that he guard his soul from sin - as when his impulse overpowers him and he desires to do a sin, he will say in his heart, \"I am vigilant about what is permissible, [so] how can I do this great evil, and 'I will have sinned to my Father in heaven all of the days.'\" And this thing will [protect] him from all of the stumbling blocks. But one who goes after natural physicality and is pulled by his desires and his pleasures - even if he does not do a forbidden thing - will be found to have distanced himself from the fundamentals of his soul and its foundation. He will have also caused his soul to follow the body and the physical and 'sever it with an ax from its roots and  its foundation.' And [it is] as it is written (Hoshea 4:11), \"Promiscuity, wine and new wine take the heart.\" Hence they gave a counsel to the one who is not able (to lead) to control his spirit and is pulled by the pleasures, to make a vow for some days to say, \"I will not eat and not drink until time x except like this\"; or to forbid what is permissible. And [then] his habit will control him, from that which he observes his vow. It comes out that he leads himself to conquer his impulse. And with this, the benefit that is in his hand is abstinence. And [it is] as [someone] said to Rabbi Pinchas (the editor said [that] this statement is in Yerushalmi Shabbat 1:3 and the version there is \"to Rav\"), \"If you are not able to eat mundane foods in purity all of the year, eat [it so] for seven days.\" As one who eats mundane foods in purity is called an abstinent, as we say (Chagigah 18b), \"The clothes of an ignoramus are impure in <i>midras</i> for the abstinent (<i>prushim</i>).\" However it is not fit to fence oneself with fences unless his impulse is overpowering him, [and then] he may make a vow as a way of healing. However one who controls his spirit and is able to reach the trait of abstinence without a vow should not vow. [It is] as we said (Yerushalmi Nedarim 9:1), \"Is it not enough for you with what the Torah forbade, such that you forbid yourself the permitted?\" But certainly if you see a man whose impulse is overpowering him, he needs to add a big fence according to that which he needs to conquer his impulse. And once he has conquered his impulse, he goes back to the moderate disposition. There is a metaphor about a physician [relevant to this]: When the physician sees that the illness is mild and easy to heal, he gives him a mild treatment. But when he sees that he illness is heavy and strong, he chooses a strong treatment until he heals; and afterwards, he goes back and gives him moderate things that hold the body's health. And because of this, they said, \"Vows are a safeguarding fence around abstinence\" - and they did not say, \"Oaths are a safeguarding fence around abstinence.\" As an oath halts immediately, as he swears that he will not eat this thing until day x. And that is not a safeguarding fence - as he is halted immediately, in that he cannot transgress it. But a vow is that he say, \"If I eat more than this amount until day x, all of the fruits of the world will be forbidden until a different time that he specifies. That is called a safeguarding fence, as it is a thing that he may overstep. And it is better for the one whose heart is dedicated to the Heavens if he is not in control of himself to do the safeguarding fence without a vow.",

With wisdom, how is it? He does not speak in front of someone greater than him in wisdom. As one who studies in front of his teacher and sees a fit rationale should not immediately think that it is true; and he should not want to say it until his teacher has finished speaking. For were he to do so, he would miss what his teacher will say and he will not know the rationales of the earlier sages; as his heart will be 'moving and wandering from knowing their opinion.' And also because his [own] rationale cannot be so focused until he hears what the early scholars said and [then] weigh in the scales of his intellect which one is more proper - this one or that one. Therefore silence for a student in front of his teacher \"is a safeguarding fence for wisdom.\" And when he finds a rationale and his teacher is still speaking, should he not be quiet? He should not open his mouth until the words of his teacher are clear and his rationale is etched into his heart - until he finishes his words and knows what his teacher taught him. And afterwards, his reasoning will be sharp and focused. And about this Shlomo, peace be upon him, said (Proverbs 18:2), \"The fool does not desire understanding, but only to reveal his heart.\" "

As in the matter of charity, one who gives a thousand zuz over a thousand times, that is according to the quantity of the deed; but \"not according to the deed\" - that is is the one gives it [all] at once.

(And for an error) (for loss) Were it not for his alacrity that the ledger is open in front of him and he immediately writes everything, sometimes he would forget the small things because of the big ones - if he would lend orally.

And the second [matter] is to inform us that there is no waiting for the opening of the ledger after he does the sin. Rather with the end of the act, it is already written; so that an instant not pass that this transgression is not attributed to him. As even though transgressions are forgiven to penitents, they are first attributed immediately when they are finished doing them. And afterwards if he repents, he is forgiven for them. [It is] as we say in the midrash, \"One who does not do it, is not like the one who does it and is forgiven\" - as the one who does not do is greater than the one that does and is forgiven. And [regarding] that which it said (Berakhot 34b), \"The completely righteous cannot stand in the place that the penitents stand,\" it wanted to say that penitents have to separate from that which is permissible [but] similar to the matter in which they sinned.
