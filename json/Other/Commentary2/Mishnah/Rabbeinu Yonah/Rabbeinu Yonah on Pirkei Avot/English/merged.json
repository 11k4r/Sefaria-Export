                "<b>Moshe recieved the Torah from Sinai, etc.:</b> (I will begin the commentary on \"Avot\" of our great, pious and holy rabbi, Rabbi Yonah the son of Rabbi Avraham, may he be remembered for blessing.) Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 30a) \"One who wishes to be pious should fulfill the words of Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), and [some] said about it, the words of Damages (Nezikin)\". And since a person ascends the steps of piousness by doing one of these matters, they placed [Avot] in the Order of Damages. And even though they also said to fulfill the words of Blessings (Berakhot) which is in the order of Seeds (Zeraim); because it speaks of the blessings on seeds and fruits, they placed it in that order (Editor's note: See what Midrash Shmuel wrote about this in the name of Rabbi Yosef Nachmias, may his memory be blessed). Furthermore, since it is the teachings of the Sanhedrin, they placed it in the order of the laws (of Damages); and so [too], all the sages mentioned [here] until Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai are all from the Sanhedrin. ", 
                "<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> both the written Torah and the oral Torah. As the Torah was given with its explanation. As if it were not so, it would be impossible to understand [its contents]. As behold, it is written (Leviticus 19:13), \"do not rob\" - and all of the [laws of] damages are within this negative commandment, and they themselves are the Torah that was received by Moshe at Sinai, even though they were not written. And it is also written (Deuteronomy 17:8), \"between a blood and a blood and between a judgement and a judgement and between an infection and an infection\" - and many of the sightings of blood and many of the various judgments and so many of the infections are known to us by the transmission [of this information]... And they are not explained [in writing] because it is not allowed to be written. And it is written (Exodus 24:12), \"and I will give you the stone tablets and the Torah and the commandment\" - \"Torah\" is the written Torah; \"and the commandment\" is the oral Torah. it comes out that you say that every commandment that He gave to Moshe at Sinai, was given with its explanation. And that which is written is what is called the written Torah and the explanation is what is called the oral Torah. And Moshe learned it from the mouth of the Mighty One.  ", 
                "<b>and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> as it is stated (Exodus 33:11), \" but his attendant, Joshua son of Nun, a youth, would not stir out of the tent.\"", 
                "<b>and Yehoshua to the Elders:</b> as it is stated (Joshua 24:31), and all the days of the elders who had length of days after Joshua.\"", 
                "<b>and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly:</b> And that is Ezra and his group. And [some of] the prophets of the Second Temple were in that group, as they said in Yevamot 16a, \"Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said, 'When Chaggai said these three things, he was sitting on this mortar.'\" Hence the prophets of the Second Temple were there after the destruction, since Haggai the prophet was there. And the men of the Great Assembly transmitted it to the men of their generation. And the sages [transmitted it] to their children after them in each and every generation. And the transmission was from one sage to another, until all of the sages of Israel gathered and a suggestion was given from all of their mouths to write down the oral Torah. And [so] they wrote and sealed the Talmud, and afterwards nothing was added to it and nothing was taken away from it. And that generation also transmitted it to the Geonim and the transmission was from one Gaon to another, one rabbi to another - until this day. ", 
                "<b>They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment:</b> They said [this] to teachers of legal decisions and decisors of legal decisions and decisors of litigation; that they should not rely on the first thought, but rather upon great deliberation and incisive investigation, so that they not err in their evaluation. As a man who is quick to make a decision is called a sinner - and even though he thought he was saying the truth, it is not [considered] accidental but rather is [considered] to be close to volitional, since he did not put it into his heart to say, the quick hearts do not understand to know. As error is found in all men, as the rabbis say (Avot 4:13), \" Be careful in study, for an error in study is considered an intentional transgression.\" And about this matter, Shlomo, peace be upon him, said (Proverbs 26:12), \"If you see a man who thinks himself wise, there is more hope for a dullard than for him.\" And it is as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Avot 4:7), \"One who is nonchalant about giving legal decisions is an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit.\" Therefore, it is incumbent upon a man who makes legal decisions to go back and forth on the matter and let his thought ripen and to hold on to it; as the matter that they said (Sanhedrin 35a) [that] we should ripen a judgement, as through ripening and deliberation, he adds reasoning to his reasoning and sharpness to his sharpness, until he judges a completely true judgement. As he will see to say with the second thought that which he did not see with the first. And about this matter, Asaf said (Psalms 73:21), \"As my heart ripened and my kidneys were silent,\" which is to say [that] after my heart has ripened and been sharp with wisdom and with my kidneys, I have been silent and have refined my understanding to know. As without this, I have not known, and this is my portion. (And as) it is after it, \"I was a dolt, without knowledge; I was brutish toward You.\" And the reason [they] said, <b>Be deliberate in judgment,</b> is in order to warn about litigation more than other legal decisions, as they are fundamental in the knowledge of Him, may He be blessed and elevated; and as Yirmiyahu the prophet said (Jeremiah 9:23), \"ponder and know Me, for I am the Lord who makes kindness, justice, and equity in the world; for in these I delight, declares the  Lord.\" And how can a man a ponder and know God, as it is not possible? However with this have we known Him, by dong judgment and justice, since God does these. And that is what is stated (Jeremiah 22:16), \"He judged for the poor and needy— then all was well. That is truly knowing Me, declares the  Lord.\" And it is is written in another place (Michah 6:8), \" And what does the Lord require of you? Only to do justice and to love kindness,\" since judgments are a pillar of the Torah. And from them the world is made firm, as is said in the Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 30 3), \"It is written in front of The Ten Commandments, 'and they will judge the people at all times' (Exodus 18:22). And after the Ten Commandment, it is written, 'And these are the laws' (Exodus 21 1). There is a parable [about this] concerning a matron that was walking along the way and her armed guards were walking in front of her and behind her.\"", 
                "<b>Raise up many disciples:</b> like the opinion of Beit Hillel. [This is] like the matter that we have learned (The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan 2:9), \"Beit Shammai say, 'We only teach a student who is fit, modest, proper and who fears Heaven, as it is stated (Job 20:26), \"All (darkness) waits for his treasured ones.\" And Beit Hillel say, 'We teach everyone: One hundred so that ten good ones will come out from them; and ten so that two will come out of them; and two, \"since since you do not know which will be proper, this one or that one or if they will both be equally good.\" And so was there a story of Hillel, who brought together all of his students and said to them, 'Are all of you here?' They said [back] to him, 'Yes.' One of his students said to him, 'All of them are here except the smallest one.' He said to them, 'Let the small one come, who the generation in the future will follow.' And they brought Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai. Behold that one should not push off the small ones for the bigger ones, since the kids will become goats.\" And about this matter the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Yevamot 62b), \"'Sow your seed in the morning, and don’t hold back your hand in the evening' (Ecclesiastes 11:6), - if you have raised disciples in your youth, raise disciples in your old age.\" Behold that the multiplication of disciples is a very good thing and a merit to the teacher.", 
                "<b>And make a fence for the Torah:</b> like the matter that is stated (Leviticus 18:30), \"And you shall guard My guarding\"; which is to say, make a guarding for my guarding. And a fence is a great thing and it is praiseworthy to make a fence for the commandments so that the one who fears the word of God not stumble in them. Hence one who observes the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed - which are the fences for the commandments of the Torah - has shown more love for [this] fear than one who does the commandment itself. As the doing of the commandments does not prove fear like the one who observes the fences, since he is careful from the start not to come to error. However, the one who does the commandment but does not observe the fence shows us that if it is good in his eyes to do the commandment, [yet] it is not bad in his eyes if he errs in it; and that he is not concerned about the fear that he will make a breach in it, and 'one who makes a breach will be bitten by a snake.' Behold that the words of the sages, may their be blessed, are pillars and 'trees' in the fear of Heaven; which is a foundation of the world and a fundamental principle of virtue. And all of the commandments are appetizers for it, as they said in the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1), \"'For your love is more delightful than wine' (Song of Song 1:2) - the words of the scribes are more beloved than the wine of Torah.\""

                "<b>Shimon the Righteous was from the remnants of the Great Assembly.</b> And he was a high priest, as they said in Tractate Tamid 21 (Yoma 69a) that he had gone out dressed with the priestly garments in front of Alexander [the Great] and [Alexander] went down and bowed before him. His servants said to him, \"Our master, A king like you should bow down to this Jew?\" He said [back] to them, \"I see the image of this one in war and I am victorious.\"", 
                "<b>He would say, \"On three things the world stands\":</b> This means to say that because of these things the world was created. As below (Avot 1:18), it states, \"On three the things the world subsists,\" and they are not those that it mentions here. Hence, we need to explain that when they said \"stands,\" it means that the world was created for them, since they are the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. This means to say that the world was created for his creatures that in the future would fulfill His will in front of Him through these things. And these three are a great pillar, such that on account of them, we are able to get to all of the things that the sages, may their memory be blessed, said that the world stands because of them.", 
                "<b>\"On the Torah\":</b> as it stated about it (as it is stated) (Proverbs 11:27), \"He who seeks what is good pursues what is pleasing.\" And good is only Torah, and because of it the world was created, as it is stated (Jeremiah 33:25), \"Were it not for My covenant, night and day[, etc.]. And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, said, (Proverbs 8:22), \"The Lord created me at the beginning of His course, as the first of His works of old\" - I was created before the whole world and because of me, all of the creations were created - in order to observe me. ", 
                "<b>\"On the service\":</b> As the Holy One, blessed be He, chose Israel from all of the nations and the Land of Israel from all of the lands, and He chose Jerusalem from all of the Land of Israel and He chose Zion from Jerusalem, as it is stated (Psalms 132:13), \"As the Lord chose Zion, He desired it for His habitation.\" And He chose the House of Choice from everything for the sake of the service, about which it is written, \"desire\" - as it states (Leviticus 1:3), \"desirous in front of God.\" Behold that because of the service the whole world was created. Then, due to our sins, the Temple was destroyed and the service was annulled. And prayer is now for us in its place, as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Taanit 2a), \"'And to serve him with all your hearts' (Deuteronomy 11:13) - what service is there in the heart, one should say this is prayer.\" And this is what it states (Psalms 51:17), \"Lord, open my lips,\" as King David said this verse about the sin of Batsheva which was volitional, and one cannot bring a sacrifice for volitional sins. And about this he stated (Psalms 51:18), \"Since You do not want me to bring sacrifices; You do not desire burnt offerings.\" Had I been able to bring a sacrifice to atone for myself, I would have brought [it]. Now that I cannot, 'Lord, open my lips and let my mouth say your praise,' and accept my prayer in place of a sacrifice and let it atone me for my sin. Also for us that do not have a sacrifice to atone for us - not accidental sins and not volitional sins - 'Lord, open my lips' and accept our prayers in place of the sacrifices.  ", 
                "<b>\"And on acts of lovingkindness\"</b> Like the matter that they said (Sukkah 49b), \"Acts of lovingkindness are greater than charity (tsedekah); since lovingkindness is both with the poor and with the wealthy but charity is only with the poor. Great is lovinkindness since it is both with one's body and with one's money, but charity is only with one's money.\"  And this is what they said, (Bava Batra 9a), \"One who gives a small coin to a poor man is blessed in six ways and and one who comforts him with words is blessed in eleven.\" And pertinent to acts of lovingkindness is to inspect the poor and to make a distinction between the good and the bad and to give preference to the modest and those that fear God over others who are not like them (even if we must give charity to all). And it is like Yirmiyahu, peace be upon him, stated (Jeremiah 18:23), \"let them be made to stumble before You; act against them in Your hour of wrath!\" - even in the time that they do charity, make them stumble that they should give it in the incorrect place. And acts of lovingkindness are even to the wealthy, to lend them money at a time when it is not found in their hand and to give them advice, as King Shlomo said, (Proverbs 27:9), \"Oil and incense gladden the heart, but the sweetness of a friend is better than one’s own counsel.\" [This] is to say, just like oil and incense gladden the heart, so [too] does one 's friend become delighted by personal advice; and when he gives him good advice, he is gladdened by it. And this trait of kindness brings God's satisfaction in front of Him, and for it was the world created - in order to do it. And about it Shlomo said in his wisdom (Proverbs 14:34), \"Righteousness exalts a nation; Sin is a reproach to any people\" - and adjacent to it, \"The king favors a capable servant\" - the will of the Holy One, blessed be He is only for Israel, who investigate [how] to do the things that are desirable in front of Him."

                "<b>\"Rather be as servants who are serving the master in order not to receive a reward\":</b> (Editor's note: In my opinion, here there should be the words, \"And it is difficult according to this textual variant.\") Since a person should not do the commandment with the intention that he will not receive a reward for them. But rather the [correct] textual variant is \"not in order to receive a reward\" - that he should not do the commandments for the sake of the reward, even though he should think that there will be recompense for his service. However, it appears to me that the variant of the books is the main one [that we should follow]: As we find such service among people, such that a purchased slave is obligated to do service without receiving reward. So too, a man must serve God in order not to receive a reward, but rather because of the kindness that He has already performed for him. And also due to the greatness of the Master, that He is fitting for this, and this is the service of God - may He be blessed and elevated - from love, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:5), \"And you shall love the Lord.\" And what is complete service among people? One who wants to serve his friend because of his love for him from earlier days, and even if he knows that he will not give him a reward. And [with] this type of love should a person love the service of God. And therefore, [the Mishnah] placed it adjacent to the matter of fear and stated,",

As if they said it with the one that will be permissible for him tomorrow - and it appears to him like 'bread in his basket - all the more so with another woman, whom the impulse desires, as the matter that it stated (Proverbs 9:17), \"stolen waters are sweet.\" But it appears to be explained according to its simple meaning, <b>They so stated with his wife,</b> not to ever accustom her to [many] words, so that she not be found with him every day. As a man should not be with his wife for his pleasure, but [rather] to fulfill the commandment; so as to distinguish between man and beast, as they said in Tractate Berakhot 22a concerning a man with a nocturnal emission, \"So that they not be with their wives like chickens.\" And that is the trait of separation which brings one to the highest levels, as we say (Avodah Zarah 20b), \"Separation brings to purity.\"",

And this is what Shlomo - peace be upon him - stated (Ecclesiastes 7:26), \"I find woman more bitter than death; she is all traps, her heart is snares and her hands are fetters.\" This means to say that death removes him from the world - from the small life of the world - but woman destroys his soul for ever and ever. Behold, 'she is more bitter than death; she is all traps and snares': When a man observes a woman, he is caught in her net, which is her trap, and he cannot escape from her. As the man sees that which his heart desires and he does not see what will happen to him from her in the end of days. As the lyricist (R. Yehudah HaLevi) said, \"The seduced dove travels in the wilderness; it sees the grain but it does not see the trap. 'Her heart is snares' - when see desires a man in her heart, even if he does not desire her and it is [just] the bad fortune of this man that caused her to desire him. 'Her hands are fetters' - because if she grabs him with her hands, he is already taken into the 'prison' and he no longer has a way to fix it. \"He who is pleasing to God escapes her, and he who is displeasing is caught by her,\" as the Holy One, blessed be He, protects the righteous and does not present them something through which they might stumble; but the sinner, who does not distance himself from evil paths and whose heart is not complete, chances upon a matter like this.

As even if his friend is not more pious than he and there are times that he does what is not in order. [Yet it is only] when he derives pleasure from something that he does the sin, but it is not his desire and his will that his friend do it - as he derives no enjoyment from this. And it is like they said (Kiddushin 63b), \"And a man will not sin if it is not for himself.\" It comes out that both of them will repent, each one according to the word of his friend. And the third is regarding advice that he can take, that he be 'more than a city for help' in all of his affairs and to take good counsel from him and to be his confidant. Since he is his ally, he will not reveal [his secrets] to others so as not to confound his plan - and not even to those that appear to him to be friends; for is the appearance of love evident on their faces? And about this Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 15:22), \"Plans are foiled for want of counsel, but they succeed through many advisers.\" And that which he said, <b>\"acquire for yourself a friend\"</b> with an expression of [acquisition] (euphemism) is [to say] that if he does not find him for free, he should acquire him with his money and expend his assets in order to get to a good friend; or that he should acquire him with words of appeasement and with a soft way of talking. And [so] he should not be exacting about his words and he should tolerate the words of his mouth; even when he says something against him, he should not return a response. As without this, he will not keep [the friendship], since the opinions [of people] are different. And sometimes he will seek something, [but] his friend who is like himself will say, \"See, I do not [consider] this to be fit.\" And if he doesn't [listen to his friend] (he will certainly pass him up), the [friendship] will unravel. And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 17:9), \"He who seeks love covers errors, but he who harps on a matter alienates a leader.\" He meant to say, one who covers when his friend errs, seeks love - as through this, their love is preserved, as he tolerates his errors. But if he harps about the matter with his friend, he speaks against him and repeats it and says, \"See what this one said; what he said about me, he 'alienates the leader' - he(certainly) alienates his leader from him, meaning to say, his friend.

                "<b>\"and judge every person as meritorious\":</b> This is speaking about a person about whom we do not know if he is righteous or if he is evil; or if we know that he is a moderate person, sometimes doing evil and sometimes doing good. And if he does something that can make us judge him unfavorably and [also] judge him favorably in our understanding - or even if, (towards) according to what appears, it leans more towards the side of guilt - if he can judge him favorably from one aspect of the matter, he should say, \"His intentions were good.\" But these words are not [applicable] to the completely righteous or the completely evil. As with the righteous person, even with an action that is completely evil and leans toward guilt in every aspect, we should judge him favorably and say, \"'It was a mistake that came out from the hand of the ruler,' and behold he regretted and observed [it] and [already] requested forgiveness.\" And it is like the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 19a), \"If you see a Torah scholar who sinned at night, do not ruminate about him during the day, lest he has repented. 'Lest' comes into your mind? But rather, I will say he certainly repented.\" The explanation of  \"'Lest' comes into your mind?\" is that since he is a Torah scholar and up until now, no corrupt thing has come to his hand; he certainly repented right away. You behold [from here that] one should not ever judge the perfectly righteous person unfavorably. And about him there is no reason to say,  \"judge every person as meritorious.\" And he also did not speak about the completely evil person. Even if his actions are completely good and it is not evident to be concerned about him regarding an angle of iniquity, a person should judge him unfavorably and say, \"He did it on the surface 'and his inside is not like his outside.'\" And it is like it is stated (Proverbs 26:25), \"Though he be fair-spoken do not trust him, for seven abominations are in his heart.\" And so [too] wrote Rambam, may his memory be blessed. And about this Shlomo stated in his wisdom (Proverbs 21:12), \"The righteous one observes the house of the wicked man; he subverts the wicked to the bad.\" He meant to say, people think that because the righteous do not know how to do evil, [hence] they do not recognize they ways of the evil - as they do not understand those that do it. And the matter is not like this, as 'the righteous one observes the house of the wicked,' and knows and recognizes and monitors the evil of his ways more than other people who know [about it], but don't pay attention to it. 'He subverts the wicked to the bad' - when the righteous person sees the action of the evildoers which appear to be in a good path, he subverts it and pushes it towards his judgment to say that he has done wrong - since he did not intend [to do] a commandment, but rather to place himself among those assumed to be good.

And he said when you see that the king hates all those who love his enemies and that he metes out bad to him, asks who is it that filled his heart to love the enemy of the king, and does to him [the same thing] that he does to his enemy; [know that] so [too] the Holy One, blessed be He, does to all those who mix with the changers - that is to say, those that change the Torah and the commandments. As [the word] 'change' here is transitive, as in (Job 29:22), \"After my word, [things] were not changed.\" And when the changers are struck, their friends will also be collected with them - 'Should one give aid to the wicked and befriend those who hate the Lord? For this, it shall be upon you.' 'As his time comes suddenly' and you will not be able to escape for your life.

And even when a man toils greatly to do what is straight in the eyes of God, a man only accomplishes a small part of what he is obligated to do.\" And this is what is stated (Psalms 103:14), \"For He knows our impulse; He is mindful that we are dust.\" Since were it not that He made the evil impulse [powerful] in man, even without his working hard and pursuing the commandments, he would do many of them.

And if he does not fertilize it and plow it, nothing will come out of it.

It was all overgrown with thorns; its surface was covered with chickweed, and its stone fence lay in ruins.\" And for this reason he made the motivation of others adjacent to the motivation of himself and said, \" If I am not for me, who will be for me,\" but if I don't toil and motivate myself to pursue the commandments, I will stay devoid of them - since, even \"when I am for myself\" and toil in them, I only reach a small portion of the many portions and what do I reach (<i>mah ani</i> can mean both \"what am I\" and what do I) if I don't toil at all?",

And about this matter, David, peace be upon him, said (Psalms 144:12), \"For our sons are like saplings, well-tended in their youth.\" He meant to say that when the sapling is small, a person can grow it to be a straight tree and not be crooked.

Since at that time, the impulse is not strong and desire is benign and the soul does not enjoy and he does not desire sinful pleasures. And this is the reason for his repentance.

                "<b>\"on truth\":</b> As a person should walk in the paths of repentance - as He is true and His Torah is true - and walk in the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He, of truth. And he should also go in that path, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 28:9), \"and you shall go in His ways.\" And the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 63a) that even in the recounting of mundane words should a person not lie, like that story of Rav's son, etc.: [Rav] said to him,\"Your mother has improved.\" He said [back] to him, \"It is I that reversed [your words to bring about the change].\" He said, \"This is as people say, 'The one that comes from you will teach you reason.' But you should not do this because of that which is stated (Jeremiah 9:4), 'they taught their mouths to speak words of falsehood.'\" For a person who accustoms his tongue to speak falsehood about a matter that has neither a loss nor gain will, when he comes to speak matters of principle, also not be able to speak the truth; as it is his mouth that will speak and the habit [of lying] will control it.", 
                "<b>and on peace\":</b> Peace includes all good things in the world, and there is no end to its benefits. And [may there be] peace upon Israel. "
