        "<b>Know</b> that each commandment that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him – was given to him with its explanation. He would say to him the commandment and afterward tell him its explanation and content; and [so too with] everything that is included in the Book of the Torah. And the manner of its teaching to Israel is as it is said (Eruvin 54b – in Chapter 5), ", 
        "Moshe would enter his tent, and Aharon would enter it first, and Moshe would tell him one time the commandment that was given to him, and teach him its explanation.", 
        "And [then] Aharon withdrew and retreated to our teacher, Moshe's, right, and Elazar and Itamar, his sons, entered after him. And Moshe would tell them what he told Aharon.", 
        "And they withdrew, and one sat to our teacher, Moshe's left and the second to the right of Aharon. And afterward, the seventy elders came, and Moshe taught them as he taught Aharon and his sons.", 
        "And afterward, the masses and 'all who sought the Lord' came and He placed that commandment in front of them, [and so forth] until they heard everything from his mouth.  ", 
        "It came out that Aharon heard that commandment from the mouth of Moshe four times, his sons three times, the elders twice and the rest of the people once.", 
        "And Moshe withdrew, and Aharon reviewed the explanation of that commandment  which he learned – that he heard from the mouth of Moshe four times, as we said – to  all those present.", 
        "And Aharon retreated from them, after his sons had heard the commandment four times – three times from the mouth of Moshe, and once from the mouth of Aharon.", 
        "And Elazar and Itamar reviewed [it,] to teach that commandment to all the people that were present, after Aharon withdrew. And they withdrew from teaching.", 
        "And it came out that the seventy elders heard the commandment four times – two from the mouth of Moshe, one from the mouth of Aharon and one from the mouth of Elazar and Itamar. ", 
        "And afterward, the elders also reviewed [it,] to teach the commandment to the masses one time. It came out that the entire congregation hears that commandment four times – once from the mouth of Moshe, once from the mouth of Aharon, a third [time] from the mouth of his sons and a fourth [time] from the mouth of the elders.", 
        "And afterward all the people went to teach – each person his neighbor – all that they heard from the mouth of Moshe – and write that commandment in scrolls. And the officers would circulate to all of Israel to teach and correct, until [the people] knew the commandment by heart and became accustomed to reading it. And afterward, they taught them the explanations of that commandment that was was given from God – and that explanation would include [many] matters. And they would write the commandment and study [it] according to the received tradition.", 
        "And so [too] did our rabbis, may there memory be blessed, say in a bereita (Sifra, Behar), “'And God said to Moshe at Mount Sinai' – and was not the whole entire Torah said form Sinai? Rather it is to tell you [that] just like [the law of] the sabbatical year was stated with its general principles and its details and its inferences from Sinai, so too were all the commandments, with their general principles and their details and their inferences, from Sinai.", 
        "And behold for you an example: When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, “You shall live in booths seven days” (Leviticus 23:42); ", 
        "Afterward, He made known that this booth is an obligation on males [and] not on females, and that sick people are not obligated in it, nor are wayfarers;", 
        "and that it only be covered with that which grows from the ground, and that he should not cover it with wool or silk or vessels – even from that which grows from the ground - for example, comforters and  pillows and clothes.  ", 
        "And  he made known that eating and drinking and sleeping in it is all an obligation; and that its space should not be less than seven finger-breadths long on seven finger-breadths wide, and that the height of the booth not be less than ten finger-breadths.", 
        "And when the prophet, peace be upon him, came, this commandment and its explanation was given to him. And so [too, with all of] the six hundred and thirteen commandments – them and their explanations – the commandment in writing, and the explanation orally.", 
        "‘And it was in the fortieth year in the eleventh month,’ on Rosh Chodesh (the first day of) Shevat, [that Moshe] gathered the people and said to them, “The time of my death has arrived; and if there is from [among] you someone who heard a law and forgot it, he should come to me and ask me, and I will elucidate it. And anyone who has a doubt about a question, he should come, and I will explain it to him,” as it is stated (Deuteronomy 1:5), “Moses undertook to expound this Torah, saying.” ", 
        "And so did the sages say in the Sifrei, Devarim 1:5, “Anyone who forget a law, let him come and review, and anyone who needs an explanation, let him come and [have it explained].”  And they took elucidations of the laws from his mouth and studied the explanations all of that time – from Rosh Chodesh Shevat until the seventh of Adar.", 
        "And when it was before his death, he began to write the Torah in books. And he wrote thirteen books of the Torah – all of them [on] parchment – from [the letter] bet [in] <i>Bereishit</i> (the first word in the Torah) to [the letter] lamed [in] <i>le’einei kol Yisrael</i> (the last phrase in the Torah) (Bava Batra 15a). And he gave a book to each and every tribe, to behave according to it and to walk in its statutes. And the thirteenth book he gave to the Levites, and said to them (Deuteronomy 31:26), “Take this book of the Torah.” ", 
        "Afterward, he went up to the mountaintop in the middle (Sifrei, Haazinu) of the seventh day of the month of Adar (Megillah 13b), as the tradition inferred. ", 
        "And that event that happened, they called death in our eyes - because we lost him and remembered him – and life for him, in honor of the heights that he reached. And so [too], they said (Sotah 13b), “Moshe, our teacher – peace be upon him – did not die, but rather he went up and is serving above.” And the things about these matters are very expansive, and this is not their place.", 
        "And when he died, peace be upon him - since he bequeathed to Yehoshua that which was imbued to him of the explanation – Yehoshua and the people of his generation applied their wisdom and their thought to [the received Torah]. And everything that Moshe received – he or any of the elders – there is nothing to say about; and no disagreement arose about it.", 
        "And whoever did not hear an explanation from the mouth of the prophet, peace be upon him, about matters that derive from them, extrapolated laws by propositions from the thirteen [exegetical] principles though which the Torah is expounded, which were given at Mount Sinai. And among those laws that they derived, there are some things wherein no disagreement arose, but [rather] they agreed about them. And there were among them [those] wherein disagreements between two opinions did arise – this one says like this, and that one says like that; this one reasons according to his reasoning and becomes more sure of his opinion, and that one reasons according to his reasoning and becomes more sure of his opinion; as principles of analysis that are by way of argumentation will result in such a result.", 
        "And when a disagreement would arise, they would go according to the majority, as it states (Exodus 23:2), “you will incline after the majority.”", 
        "And know that prophecy does not help in the explanation of the Torah and in the extrapolation of its derivative commandments through the thirteen principles. [Rather,] that which Yehoshua and Pinchas would do in the matter of research and reasoning, that is [also] that which Ravina and Rav Ashi did. But the advantage of the prophet and his effect on the commandment – if you should ask; as my soul is alive – that  is one of the great and powerful fundamental principles upon which religion and its foundation relies.", 
        "<b>And I see</b> that this is a fit place to elucidate this fundamental principle. And it is impossible [to do so] except after dividing the prophets that claim to have prophecy, in what way their prophecy is validated – which is likewise a great fundamental principle.", 
        "And already all of the masses of people – and also a small number of their notables – have erred in this, as they imagine to themselves that prophecy does not exist with one who has it until he does a wondrous sign – like the signs of Moshe, our teacher, may his memory be blessed – and he changes the manner of the world; [or] like Eliyahu, may his memory be for the good, did in his bringing back to life the son of the widowed woman (II Kings 17); or, as is known to every person, with the signs of Eisha, peace be upon him. ", 
        "And this is not a true fundamental principle. As everything that Eliyahu and Elisha and the rest of the prophets did of [these] wonders, they did not do them in order to establish their [status] of prophecy – as their prophecy was already established before then. Rather, they did these signs for their needs; and because of their abundant closeness to the Holy One, blessed be He, He fulfilled their wills. As it is promised to the righteous ones (Job 22:28), “And you will decide to say it, and it will arise for you.” But their prophecy is established by that which we will explain about the matter that we have begun to speak about.", 
        " And I say at the outset that that which I say is a fundamental principle in our religion regarding prophecy – and that is that those that [claim to] have prophecy are first divided into two categories: the one that prophecies in the name of idolatry and the one that prophecies in the name of God. And the prophecy of idolatry is divided into categories: ", 
        "<b>The first category</b> is that a prophet arise and say, “X star cast its spirit upon me and said to me like this, or 'Call upon me like this and I will answer you.'” And so [too], if he calls [people] to serve the Baal or one of the images, and says “The image informed me like this and said to me, thus, and commanded me about his worship with matter x,” as the prophets of Baal and Asherah would do (I Kings 18).", 
        "<b>And the second category</b> is that he say, “The word of God [came] to me to worship baal x or to bring down the force of the y queen of the heavens for matter z,” and he says to them a matter from the matters of their service and the acts that the idolaters of that idolatry do, as it is established for us in the Torah. And this is also prophesying in the name of idolatry, as this appellation includes one who says that it itself commanded it [as well as] one who says that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded to worship any thing from them.", 
        "And when we hear one of these two ideas from the one who [claims to] have prophecy, and witnesses testify about him according to that which is stated in the Torah; his judgement is that he be killed by strangulation, as the Holy One, blessed be, stated (Deuteronomy 13:6), “And that prophet or dream-diviner shall be put to death.”", 
        "And it is not for us to examine the one who [claims] prophecy and we do not request a sign. And even – if to establish his prophecy – he does from the signs and wonders, the grandeur of which have not known, he is to be strangulated. And we do not examine his signs, as the reason for the existence of these signs is that which the verse states (Deuteronomy 13:4), “for the Lord, your God, is testing you.”", 
        "And also, the intellect that denies his testimony is more trustworthy than the eye that sees his signs – as it has already become [exceedingly] clear for the intelligentsia to only honor and serve the One who makes exist all that exist and the One who brings together all perfection. ", 
        "And the one who prophecies in the name of God is also divided into two categories:", 
        "<b> The first category</b> is that he prophecies in the name of God and calls to the masses to believe him and he commands about His service and says that the Holy One, blessed be He, added a commandment to the commandments or subtracted a commandment from the tally of commandments that were gathered together in the Book of the Torah. And there is no distinction between if he adds or subtracts upon the verse, or if he adds or subtracts upon the traditionally received explanation. ", 
        "And the matter that he add or subtract from the verse is, for example, that he say that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me that the <i>orlah</i>-prohibition is for two years, and after two years, it is permissible to eat the fruits of the saplings; or that he says, “The Holy One, blessed be He, told me that <i>orlah</i> is forbidden to eat for four years”; instead of what the Holy One, blessed be He, said (Leviticus:19:23), “three years it shall be forbidden for you,” and similar to it.", 
        "Or if he changes anything in the received tradition – and even if the simple meaning of the verse supports him; for example, that he says that that which is stated in the Torah (Deuteronomy 25:12), “you shall cut off her hand,” is truly cutting off the hand, and not a fine for the one that embarrasses, as is the received tradition; and he attributes the thing to prophecy and says that the Holy One, blessed be He, told me that this commandment that He stated, “you shall cut off her hand,” is like its simple meaning – this one, too, is killed by strangulation; as he is a false prophet and he attributes to the Holy One, blessed be He, that which He did not say to him.", 
        "And also with this one, one should not examine the sign or wonder; as the prophet who showed his signs to all the people of the world and brought into our hearts to legitimate him and believe him – as the verse states (Exodus 19:9), “and also trust you forever” – he told us in the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, that another Torah besides this one will not come from the Creator. And that is what he said (Deuteronomy 20:12), “It is not in the Heavens.”", 
        "And it stated (Deuteronomy 20:14), “in your mouth and in your heart, to do it” – the matter of “in your mouth” is the commandment that is known orally; and the matter of “in your heart” is the analyses that [the sages] extrapolated with investigation, which are included in the powers that come from the heart. ", 
        "And we have also been warned against adding and subtracting from [commandments known in the ways just mentioned], as it is stated (Deuteronomy 20:13), “neither add to it nor subtract from it.” And therefore they, peace be upon them, said (Megillah 2b), “A prophet may not innovate something from now [on].”", 
        "And since we knew that his claim about the Holy One, blessed be He, is a false claim, and he attributed to Him something that He did not tell him; we become obligated to kill him, as the verse states (Deuteronomy 18:20), “But any prophet who willfully, etc. that prophet shall die.”", 
        "<b>And the second category</b> is with regards to the prophet that, for example, calls to people to serve God, and commands about His commandments and warns to observe the Torah, without addition or subtraction – as the prophet who was the end of the prophets said (Malakhi 3:22), “Remember the Torah of Moshe, My servant” – and promises good rewards to the one that does it, and warns with a punishment anyone who transgresses it, as did Yishaya, Yirmiyahu, Yechezkel and the other ones of them.", 
        "And he commands commandments and [enacts] prohibitions about a matter that is not from the Torah – for example, he says, “Fight against city x” or “nation y, now”; as Shmuel commanded Shaul to fight against Amalek (I Samuel 15).", 
        "Or he prevents from killing, like that which Elisha prevented Yehoram from killing the troops of Aram that entered Shomron, like the matter that is known (II Kings 6:22); and like that which Yishaya prevented the bringing of water inside the wall (Isaiah 22:9); and like that which Yirmiyahu prevented Israel from going to the Land of Israel (before the completion of seventy years, or it should say “to the land of Egypt” – Jeremiah 42:15); and similar to this matter. ", 
        "And because of this, when a prophet makes the claim of prophecy and does not attribute it to idolatry and does not add to the Torah or subtract from it – but [rather] says other things, as we have recounted – we then need to test him to clarify his testimony for us. ", 
        "As anyone, the prophetic testimony of which is substantiated, is fitting to do all that he commands – from a small thing to a large. And anyone who transgresses any of his commands is obligated death at the hand of Heaven; as the Holy One, blessed be He, stated about someone who transgresses the command of the prophet (Deuteronomy 18:19), “I will require it from him.” And if his testimony is not substantiated, he is put to death by strangulation.", 
        "And the substantiation of prophetic testimony will be according to what I will tell: When a person [claims to] have prophecy, as we have elucidated, and he be fit for it – for example, that he be from the men of wisdom, faith, asceticism, intellect and pleasant character traits – as it is a fundamental principle for us that prophecy only resides upon one who is wise, strong and wealthy (Shabbat 92a – Chapter 10). ", 
        "And there are many positive virtues in this matter – it is impossible to group them all together. And the [explanation] about them and the proof of each one of them from verses from the books of the Torah and the words of the prophets would require a book of its own – and maybe God will assist me to it, with all that is fitting to write about this matter.", 
        "And when the one prophesying is fit for prophecy, according to that which is appropriate, we say to him, “Prove to us with predictions and  tell us things from among that which the Holy One, blessed be He, has taught you.” And he tells and promises [their truth]. And if all of his predictions are substantiated, then we know that all of his prophecies are true. But if he lies about it, or even if one of his words fails – and even if it is a small thing – we know that he is a false prophet."
