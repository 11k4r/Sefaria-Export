                    "<b>\"Distance [yourself] from a bad neighbor:\"</b> It stated an expression of distancing with his neighbor, since a person is close to him. And with an evildoer who is not his neighbor, it was not forced to say, 'distance,' since he is not close. [Rather,] it only warned him not to befriend him. And it said about the neighbor, \"bad,\" and about the one who is not a neighbor, \"evildoer\" - even though both of them are evildoers - since his being neighbors with an evildoer is bad for [the latter's] neighbor, and his proximity is very harmful. But the evil of an evildoer who is not near to a person does not cause that person any bad - even though he is an evildoer to the Heavens - unless he befriends him. So did he write in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious teacher, Rabbi Yosef Ibn Shoshan. And in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Lirma, he wrote that he was precise [about] why it said, \"distance\" (<i>harchek</i>) - which is from the causative [form] - and it did not say, \"distance oneself\" (<i>hitrachek</i>) - which is from the reflexive form. And he said [that the reason is] that if a person comes to live next to the bad neighbor because he doesn't know him, one should distance [this newcomer] and warn him not to dwell [near] him. Up to here [are his words.] And in my eyes it appears that in both of the [cases here], the teacher adopted the language of scripture. With distancing, as it is stated (Proverbs 5:8), \"Distance from upon her your path;\" and you do not find <i>mitrachek</i> as a causative expression in all of scripture. And with befriending, as it is stated (II Chronicles 20:37), \"With your making friends with Achaziyahu the Lord breached your acts.\" And that is as [the mishnah] ends, \"and do not despair of punishment,\" which it  as it is in this verse [where the punishment comes at the end]. ", 
                    "<b>\"and do not despair of punishment:\"</b> And it does not say that he should worry about punishment, since such a thing is a bad trait - the one who worries about punishment; but [rather], \"do not despair of punishment.\" Which is what Haman did when he relied upon his great wealth, and in the blink of an eye, his success reversed itself upon him. And this is [the meaning] of the expression, 'do not despair' - Derekh Chaim. "

                    "<b>\"Sages, be careful with your words:\"</b> That which he warned the Sages, was not [with] the intention that other people are not warned about this; but rather if a doubt arises about the words of the Sages, the listeners will come to a general mistake, which is not the case with the words of a commoner, to whose words we are not attentive. Therefore, he warned the Sages more - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan.", 
                    "<b>\"a place of evil waters:\"</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: \"That show sides of the Torah that are not like the law (<i>halakha</i>), and this is a term for 'evil waters.'\" And the language is cut up (inverted), since evil waters is a term for sides of the Torah that are not like the law. And the language of Rambam: \"Evil waters is a term for heresy.\"", 
                    "<b>\"and the students who follow after you will drink:\"</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, \"As happened to Antigonos, the man of Socho, with  Tsadok and Beitos, etc... and they and their students became heretics.\" And similar to this did he write, in the last chapter of Mishnah Yadayim 4:6, \"Groups of Jews gathered with them, etc.\" And this is not exactly the same as the words of the teacher, who is only teaching because of \"the students that come after you.\" And I found in the commentary of Rashbam [on the] chapter [entitled], Yesh Nochalin (Baba Batra 115a), who wrote in the name of Avot DeRabbi Natan a story of Tsadok and Beitos who were teaching their students the words of Antigonos, \"Do not be like servants, etc.\" and the students erred, etc. And so [too] did I see in Avot DeRabbi Natan, Chapter 5."

                    "<b>\"Spread (<i>Negad</i>) a name, lose his name:\"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, \"He who extends his name, etc.\" And so [too] does Rambam explain. And in Derekh Chaim, he is precise about the change in language, as from the beginning, he teaches, \"a name,\" and afterwards, \"his name.\" And he explains that this is what he is saying: <i>Negad shema</i> - meaning to say, the name of dominion, <i>nagid</i> (noble). And this indicates spreading, but it is not fitting; rather [it is better] to lose the name of one having dominion, since lordship buries, etc. And there are those that have the textual variant, \"Spread a name, lose a name,\" with a [Hebrew letter,] alef. And in Midrash Shmuel, \"'Spread a name' - one who spreads his name to make for himself a name, like the name of the great ones, loses his name, that he had before. And he ends up 'bald' (lacking a name) from this and from that.\" And in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan, he wrote that the correct version is both of [the times, 'name' is spelled] with [the Hebrew letters,] shin, mem, alef. And about that which he stated it in the language of translation (Aramaic), see the end of our tractate. ", 
                    "<b>\"and one who does not add, will cease:\"</b> And Kessef Mishneh in Chapter 3 of the Laws of Torah Study (Mishneh Torah) explained, \"That since he says, 'spread a name,' meaning to say, one who learns in order to enhance his name (fame), [will] 'lose his name;' and lest you say in your heart, 'I will no longer learn - as lest my learning will be for my name, and it will be lost, etc.' To this he said, 'and one who does not add, will cease' certainly - as one who learns and stops is more difficult than everything. And concerning the one who [even] before he learned, says that he will not learn - to this, he says, 'he is liable to die.' And this is not [as bad as] 'cease,' since here he is [only] obligated in the death penalty, but if he has a merit, it suspends it for him.\" To here are his words. And this is not like the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura, who explains that \"one that does not learn\" is worse than \"one who does not add.\" ", 
                    "<b>\"and one uses the crown:\"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains, \"The crown of Torah.\" And that which [the Mishanh] stated plain, 'crown,' and did not explain, 'of the Torah' is because all of the crowns besides it are nothing - Midrash Shmuel in the name of R. Y. Ibn Shoshan. "
