And [so] He delayed His anger upon him, as He delayed His anger upon Aharon for the story of the [golden] calf. And when in <i>Parshat Zot Chukat HaTorah</i> the people complained about the water, and in their complaint, they pointed out how Moshe and Aharon were the cause of the people's death and that they [would] not enter the land - as they said (Numbers 20:4), \"And why did you bring the congregation of the Lord to this wilderness to die there, us and our cattle\" - the verse mentioned that Moshe and Aharon went from in front of the congregation to the tent of meeting, mourning and with covered heads; and [they were] like embarrassed women at the mention of their sins. And thus did the word [of God] come to them that they should speak and do the act that He mentioned to extract the water. And when Moshe came to anger in his saying (Numbers 20:10), \"Listen now, you rebels,\" the Holy One, blessed be He, became full of anger with him; since Israel caught him fittingly and He did not admit in his heart that which he sinned, and [so] got angry with them. And therefore He saw at this time to give [Moshe and Aharon] their punishment for their earlier sins. And, if so, the Waters of Merivah were the means to the thing and not the actual cause for it."

                    "\"And God said to Moses, carve for yourself\" ... until \"protect for yourself that which I teach you this day.  Here I banish ...\"  And there is reason to question on these verses as follows:", 
                    "1. The first question: why did God command Moses to carve two tablets of stone akin to the first [set of tablets], upon which God would inscribe the Ten Commandments that were on the first set of tablets.  For if the second set of tablets were to replace the first set, it would be appropriate for them to be identical in all respects; however, the first set were both carved and inscribed by God, while the second set were carved by Moses, who did not inscribe them, and inscribed by God, who did not carve them.", 
                    "The second question: why did the second set of tablets have greater holiness than the first set, as indicated by the verse, \"and no man shall ascend [the mountain] with you.\"  And for the first tablets, the verse said \"ascend to God, you and Aharon and Nadav and Avihu ...\" Also, here the verse warned \"the sheep and the cattle shall not graze adjacent to the mountain,\" while no such restriction appears with respect to the first tablets.  It appears that the second tablets that Moses carved were holier than the first set that were carved by God.", 
                    "The third question: the verse states \"and he called,\" as if to say he witnessed, \" and I called in the name of God before you.\"  We might ask, what is this testimony, for after this the verse states \"and God passed before him and he called 'Hashem Hashem ...'\" and if so, there are two separate testimonies, where for one it says \"he called in the name of God\" and in the other it simply says \"and God called.\"  And if the caller is Moses, we must ask if God stood beside him (as specified in the verse) why did Moses call out to him.  ", 
                    "The fourth question: why weren't all of God's promises to Moses enacted, as there were things He promised that were absent and other things that were added on. For God promised \"I will allow all of My goodness to pass before you ... and I will remove My hand and you will see Me from behind.\"  Yet we do not seen this enacted [in the verses]; neither God's passing His goodness before Moses, nor Moses seeing Him from behind. God also said, \"I will proclaim the Name of the Lord before you, and the grace that I grant and the compassion that I show,\" which are the three attributes (God, Compassion, Grace) and no others.  Yet, at the moment of action, He proclaimed thirteen attributes.  And so He added upon his promise.  And note that in His promise, Grace preceded Compassion, but in the recital of the thirteen attributes, Compassion came before Grace. ", 
                    "The fifth question: the verse states, \"God descended in a cloud and stood with Moses there.\"  Why specify that He descended in a cloud? And what is the meaning of \"H/he stood with H/him there\" - who was standing with whom?  Was God standing with Moses or was Moses standing with God?  And note that at the revelation at Mt. Sinai, the verse states, \"And God descended onto Mt. Sinai,\" but did not reference a descent in a cloud.  For if one were to say that there was a cloud there, the verse does not reference one when God descended to speak to the Israelite nation.", 
                    "The sixth question: the verse, \"And the Lord passed before him,\" should have appeared at the be  ginning of the story, and not in the middle after the prior verse stated, \"And the Lord descended in a cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord,\" for He was already speaking with him. So why specify, \"the Lord passed before him,\" for after He proclaimed the name of the Lord there was no break in the attributes.  And there was no separation between them.  Note that in reference to the \"standing\" the verse did not say \"before him\", only that He stood there.  Indeed, in reference to His passing the verse says \"before him.\"  And pay no mind to the teaching that explains that the phrase \"the Lord passed before him\" means that, in response to Moses' desire to see the Lord's face, the Lord changed the subject by enumerating the attributes, for this is not supportable from the grammar or the context. ", 
                    "The seventh question: when enumerating the thirteen attributes, why did God repeat the attribute \"The Lord\" twice. For no other attribute is repeated in this manner. And one cannot say that once was for the \"Koreh\" and one is for the \"Kriyah\" as the Gaon proposes: he wishes to say that the verse should be read, \"and the Lord called out, 'the Lord, a God compassionate and gracious.\" Yet the cantillation dissuades us from this reading, as the Ibn Ezra responds, and one also should not say that the repeated name is similar to God calling out \"Abraham, Abraham\" or \"Moses, Moses.\" For no other attribute is repeated here, whereas repeated names can be found in instances where on is speaking down to another, such as from a master to a servant, when required.  But calling out the Lord's honored name is not speaking down.  And furthermore, after verses stated, \"And the Lord passed before him,\" it is clear that it was God calling out and  no other, so why would the verse need to specify that \"the Lord passed by\" and \"the Lord called out?\" ", 
                    "The eighth question: why aren't all of theses names and attributes expressed in the same conjugation (i.e., an active verb)?  Three of them are expressed in Pa'ul (Compassionate, Gracious and Slow to Anger).  And it would have been more appropriate to say \"Bestower of Compassion and Grace, who Curbs His Anger\" as with the attributes that follow \"Abounding in Kindness, Extending Kindness to the thousandth generation, Forgiving Iniquity, and Visiting Iniquity.  And the Ramban writes that Compassionate, Gracious and Slow to Anger are all advjectives describing the Lord's elevated stature, therefore there was no need to say \"Bestower of Compassion and Grace, who Curbs His Anger\" because the name/attributes of \"The Lord, The Lord, a God ...\" is the subject of these attributes.  But I do not understand his ways, and his writings are insufficient to answer this question.", 
                    "The ninth question: when the verse states \"forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin\" why does it not reference other acts such as mutiny, malice and guilt and the like.  And why does Moses in his prayer after hearing the attributes in their entirety say, \"Let the Lord please walk in our midst ... and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and erase the crimes.\" And the Prophet Micah says, \"Who is like you, God, who pardons iniquity and passes over sin.\" And erases crimes. And the Psalmist said, \"the iniquities of my youth and my sins do not remember.\" And erase the crime.  Why did each one of these complete Sages independently invoke the erasure of crimes? And none of them recall the three attributes (\"forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin\") together that are referenced in attributes here.", 
                    "The tenth question: [raises apparent contradictions within the 13 attributes]", 
                    "The eleventh question: visits the sins of the fathers upon the sons. How can one think that this is just or righteous, as the one who sins is worthy of death. And why punish the sons for sings of their fathers, for the verse says, \"Sons shall not die for their fathers.\" And I have already raised this issue in Parshat Yitro with respect to the Ten Commandments.", 
                    "The twelfth question: why did the Blessed One see fit to enumerate these attributes and names but not others which were recounted elsewhere, such as \"The Almighty, the Great, the Powerful and the Awesome,\" or the name \"God Almighty, \"God of Hosts,\" \"Righteous and Just,\" \"Good and Beneficent,\" \"Creator of Universes,\" \"Living and Everlasting,\" \"Giver of Pardon and Forgiveness,\" \"Jealous and Avenging,\" \"Lord of the Sun,\" and all of the other descriptions that the prophets permitted as expressions of God.", 
                    "The thirteenth question: in the order of the attributes, you will find that \"The Lord, the Lord\" are considered attributes of mercy and \"Almighty\" is an attribute of justice, other than Rashi who says it is an attribute of mercy based on a verse from Psalsm (22) \"My Almighty, My Almighty, why have you forsaken me.\" But there is no merit to Rashi's argument that Almighty is an attribute of mercy, for it was out of a sense of justice that King David complained, why did you leave, God - it would be appropriate for you to punish [Israel] and not to forsake her. \"Merciful and Gracious\" are attributes of mercy and \"Long Suffering\" is an attribute of justice. \"Abundant in Goodness and Truth\" are completely merciful, and after them come the attributes of justice.  Why were all of the attributes of mercy clustered together and all of the attributes of justice clustered together, instead of being mixed amongt each other?", 
                    "The fourteenth question: [How are the 13 attributes counted]", 
                    "The fifteenth question: The Blessed Lord said, \"Before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been brought in all the land, nor in any nation; and all the people amongst you shall see the work of the Lord, for it is awesome that which I am about to do with you.\" But the subsequent verses do not recount any miracles or wonders that were done after this Moses, \"such as have not been brought in all the land, nor in any nation; and all the people amongst you shall see the work of the Lord,\" as the Lord said. What was the purposes of this covenant and for what purpose was it made. And I have parsed the verses in a permissible manner and these are all my questions.", 
                    "Response: \"And the Lord said to Moses, 'Carve for yourself' ... and Moses carved two tablets of stone.\"  The opinion of all authentic scholars is that Moses stood upon the mountain three times, forty days and forty night each time, for a total of four months and two days, with two additional days of descent in the interim.  For on the day that Moses initially descended, he destroyed the tablets, and the verse (Exodus 32) then states, \"On the following day, Moses said to the nation, 'You have sinned\" ... and now I will ascend to the Lord and will stand and pray there forty more days until your sins are forgiven.\"  On his second descent, the verse states, \"Moses awoke in the morning,\" it was four months and four days from the sixth day of Sivan (the date of Moses' first ascent) to Yom Kippur, which was on the tenth day of Tishrei.  And the order of the verses here supports this timeline.  Additionally, we have the verse from Deuteronomy (5:15) where Moses recounts three times that he stood upon Mt. Sinai, forty days each time, as it states, \"As I ascended to the mountain ... and I stayed upon the mountain forty days and forty nights.\"  And the Lord gave me the two tablets of stone, and this is the first stay upon the mountain.  Afterwards, the verse states, \"I prostrated before the Lord as I did the first time, forty days and forty nights ... for all of your sins,\" and this is the second stay upon the mountain (and with respect to this, Moses also said, \"I prostrated myself before the Lord forty days and forty nights that I prostrated ...\" which are the days of the second ascent, which is recounted again so that Moses could share the prayer that he prayed at that time.  Afterwards he said, \"At that time, the Lord said to me, 'Carve for yourself two tablets of stone similar to the first ones' ... and I stood upon the mountain as I did the first time, for forty days and forty nights. And this was the third stay upon the mountain. \"And He answered,\" and with this answer the forgiveness was completed ", 
                    "And God said to Moses, \"Carve for yourself,\" to inform him that he would not merit the complete vision of the testimony except through the Torah which was given by his hands, for without this Moses would not have achieved this level of spiritual greatness.  And the reason for the word \"yourself\" was to warn Moses that he himself, and no other, should carve the tablets.  For the word \"yourself\" connotes isolation, as it was written [with respect to Abraham], \"Go yourself from your land ...\" that Abraham should go without his father or relatives (as explained there).  Similarly [with respect to the spies sent to Canaan], \"Send for yourself men ...\" that Moses should send them alone, apart from the rest of the nation.  And here, God saw that the tablets encompassed two miraculous qualities.  The first was that the workmanship was divine work, done in a miraculous fashion, and the second was the inscription, which was divinely written.  When Moses shattered the tablets, the workmanship and form was lost, but the words inscribed were not destroyed or lost. Therefore, God commanded Moses to carve the stone to make new tablets, ready to be inscribed, for it was Moses' obligation since he destroyed the first set of tablets.  However, He said the inscription would not be written by Moses, because he did not destroy "

                    "Behold, if so, from these six questions which Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - commanded to the scouts that they know and return the word to him, there was not one that the people asked, when they said (Deuteronomy 1:22), \"and they will return to us the word: the path that we shall go up upon, and the cities that we shall come unto\" - as Moshe did not command that they should know anything about the paths nor what cities were more fitting to conquer first. And also the scouts in their answers did not respond to this at all. But [rather], Moshe in his knowing the evil of the people, [understood] that there was to know whether the land was good and broad, plentiful of food and plentiful of settlement, in [such] a way that they would eat and be satiated and greatly delight upon it. And [so] he commanded them the two questions about the inhabited land and the two last questions about the land that is worked and sown. However, the other two questions Moshe invented himself, to ask about them. And this was in order that they know that the enemies were a large and strong nation and that the cities were fortified into the skies; and with this, they would recognize and know that their Savior is strong, and that it would not be with their [own] strength that they would inherit the land, and that their forearms would not deliver them. And hence they would increase their clinging to God, may He be blessed, and call to Him, 'since it is a time of trouble for Yaakov and from it he shall be delivered.' Behold, it has become clear from this that Moshe did not ask about the land, \"whether it is good or bad,\"  because of his being in doubt about the divine designs - God forbid - but rather to answer their questions, in his thinking that for this did they request to send scouts, as I elucidated; and that he only asked them, \"are they strong or weak, are they few or are they many,\" in order to sway their hearts to return to God and to supplicate in front of Him, 'since to God is deliverance,' and that they should say, \"Let us go and return to God,  so that He should do with us all of His wonders,\" and like he did at the [Reed] Sea. And it appears to me in truth that our master, Moshe, sinned in these first two questions that he asked about the people and the cities, as Israel did not ask them and also God, may He be blessed,  did not command about them, but [rather] he asked them on his own. And there is no doubt that his intention was good, but there came out from it what came out - 'like an error that goes out in front of the ruler.' And since 'an error in study is considered an intentional transgression,' the master of the prophets was punished."
