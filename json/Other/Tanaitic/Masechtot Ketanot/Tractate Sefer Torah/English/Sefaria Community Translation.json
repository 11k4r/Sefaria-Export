            "A Sefer Torah is not written on a hide of an impure animal, and not on a hide of an impure wild animal, and not sewn with their sinews, and not wrapped with their hair. It is a halacha from Moshe at Sinai that it should be written on a hide of a pure animal, and a hide of a pure wild animal, as is sewn with pure hides, and wrapped with pure hair, and written with ink. Because their is a verse to be relied up upon, \"And I will write the book with ink\" (Jeremiah 36)."
