            "...Author's introduction", 
            "...First Introduction: \"It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a matter\" (Proverbs 25:2). We find in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabba, Ch. 9): Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Chama bar Chanina said: From the beginning of the book of Bereshit until \"and he completed\" it is the glory of God to conceal a thing.\" Concerning the remaining parts of the Torah, \"search a matter out.\" Since a person's understanding is subjective, (relative to the person) the concept being studied cannot be completely unrelated to the subjective world of the student. Were a perception completely unrelated to the human being, it would not be fit for human analysis. For this reason the Torah does not openly speak of the world to come or the immortality of the soul. If the Torah were the work of a ruler of flesh and blood concerned to warn his subjects not to disobey his commands, no doubt these things would be mentioned. The concepts 'world to come' and 'garden of Eden' would be used as incentives to ensure that his will is followed. Those who obey him would be guaranteed-a share in the 'garden of Eden' and those who disregard his will would be threatened with dire punishment. However the Torah work of the living God transmitted to us by the prophet. therefore the topics dealt with are relative to the comprehension of the prophet. 'The world to come' and 'immortality' are Nivdal. set apart from corporeal man and having no existence within, the world presently accessible to him; consequently any concepts we can formulate about them must be remote and apart from human comprehension; and a prophet cannot consider anything that is beyond human reach. In this respect, there is a difference between wisdom and prophecy. The scholar comprehending through intellect can grasp the most abstract and esoteric concepts. The prophet on the other hand is called a \"seer\" or \"man of vision\". Since his prophecy shares its characteristics with his external vision and viewpoint, he must have some experiential connection with the object of his prophecy.",
