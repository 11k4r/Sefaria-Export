        "Why There Exist Four Kingdoms": [
            "Daniel (7:2-7)- “In my vision at night, I saw the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea. Four mighty beasts different from each other emerged from the sea. The first was like a lion but had eagles’ wings. As I looked on, its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted off the ground and set on its feet like a man and given the mind of a man. Then I saw a second, different beast, which was like a bear but raised on one side, and with three fangs in its mouth among its teeth; it was told, ‘Arise, eat much meat!’ After that, as I looked on, there was another one, like a leopard, and it had on its back four wings like those of a bird; the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. After that, as I looked on in the night vision, there was a fourth beast—fearsome, dreadful, and very powerful, with great iron teeth—that devoured and crushed, and stamped the remains with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts which had gone before it; and it had ten horns. While I was gazing upon these horns, a new little horn sprouted up among them; three of the older horns were uprooted to make room for it. There were eyes in this horn like those of a man, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly.\"", 
            "There is to ask, these four empires which Hashem established in his world, there is no doubt this occurrence is an accident.  Rather, it must be that is necessitated by the order of the world which Hashem arranged the world.  If so, why is it that there needed to be exactly four empires?", 
            "If you think deeply you will find, that when Hashem created his world, the Torah verse hides a secret hint to these four empires: [(Genesis: 1,2) \"the earth being unformed and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God sweeping over the water—\".]  'Reish Lakish explained the depth of the verse as reference to the exiles: \"the earth being unformed\"- this is a reference to the empire of Babylon, as it says in (Jeremiah, 14) \"I saw the earth and it was unformed\".  \"and void\" - this is a reference to the empire of Persia, as it says in (Ester: 6,14): \"and hurriedly [same root as 'void'] brought Haman\".  \"with darkness\" - this is reference to the empire of Greece, who darkened the eyes of Yisrael with their decrees.  They would say to them, write upon the horn of an ox that they have no part in the God of Israel.  \"over the surface of the deep\" - this is a reference to the evil empire, which is innumerable like the deep; just as the deep as no end, just so these evil people.  \"and a wind from God sweeping\" - this is the wind of the King the Messiah, as it's written (Isiaih: 11,2) \"The spirit [same root as 'wind'] of the Hashem\".  Through what merit will [Moshiach] be summoned and come? \"sweeping over the waters\" - in the merit of Teshuva, which is likened to water, as it says (Lamentations: 2,19) \"Pour out your heart like water\".(B'R: 2,4).  If you think deeply you will find that when Hashem created his world he arrange these four empires!  If so, we must ask, for what purpose and why would Hashem build into his world these four empires.   ", 
            "The explanation is this: it is appropriate that these four empires would be hinted and concealed within the beginning of creation.  For these four empires which have dominated the world, they only exist because it would have been impossible without them.  For the world is a dependent created entity of Hashem.  It must that this dependent created entity must definitionally be lacking, and therefore we find within it lacks! [R' Hartman gives two reasons for this principle: 1.) A created entity cannot be on the same exact level as the creator so therefore Hashem's creation must contain within it imperfection and 2.) A created entity didn't always exist, and the void which preceded it is contained within it].   And this axiomatic lack is the four empires, for they minimize the glory of Hashem in his world.  And since the world was created by Hashem, it was fitting that everything would be under the dominion of Hashem, for Hashem created everything, and therefore everything was fitting that it should be created for his glory.  But since it creation is a dependent entity, it's impossible for it to be without lack.  This thing [the lack] is not from Hashem, for there is no emptiness or lack within the creative act whatsoever, rather the lack is within the world for it is a dependent created entity.  From this the lack is generated, that these empires should dominate in the world and detract from the glory of Hashem.  And this concept is appropriately concealed and hinted within the beginning of creation itself.  From the side of creation itself it was appropriate that everything should dwell under the dominion of Hashem, as it says (Yoma: 38a) 'Whatever the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, He created in His honor, as it is stated: “Everyone who is called by My name, I have created for My glory” (Isaiah 43:7)", 
            "[This Talmudic statement] means to say that after Hashem created everything, certainly he created everything for his own glory, for it's definitionally impossible for an entity to go out from Oneness which is contrary to it, for if so this entity would be a self-contradiction.  The matter cannot be such, rather everything must have been created for his glory.  If this is true, how could it be that these empires erase the glory of Hashem?  Rather, there must be a definitional lack in the creation itself, for lack does not exist within Hashem, and this [lack] must be a cause unto itself.  ", 
            "Therefore the empires are appropriately four, for the empires are the deviation from the glory of Hashem, and Hashem is One, and the center is connected to One because the center is the point of oneness.  Accordingly, the Holy Temple and Jerusalem are both One, and thus they are the center of the world.  For the center is suited for this.  So too Yisrael are one nation, suited for them is the land [Israel] which is one alone, for it is the center of the world.  The general principle is that an entity which is one is suited to be in the center.  A deviation from oneness connects to fourness, corresponding to the four directions which diverge from the middle.  Therefore the empires are four, corresponding to the four directions which diverge from the center.  It's for this reason that we expounded from the language \"unformed and void\" four empires, because this wording speak to the essential lack within creation itself, and from the aspect of lack within the creation itself these four empires were born.  They [the four empires] are unique for this matter, for their dominion deviates from Hashem until they erase his Oneness in the world.  And the disposal of these four empires was said: ", 
            "(Zecharia: 14,9) \"And the LORD shall be king over all the earth; in that day there shall be one LORD with one name.\"  As long as these four empires rule the world, the glory of Hashem will not be revealed in his world.  Therefore these four empires, vis-a-vis the lack within creation itself (for it would be definitionally impossible to find a creation in total completeness, it must contain lack).  And this lack is not vis-a-vis Hashem who created everything, rather vis-a-vis the created world itself.  And this is concealed and hinted at through the verse: \"When God began to create heaven and earth—.  the earth being unformed and void\" etc.. for the earth which is the lower [element of creation] therewith darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God sweeping over the water—\"", 
            "From the aspect of this lack which is inherent in the creation were born these four empires, who took royalty/kingship/dominion from Yisrael.  As this nation [Yisrael] was created for the Glory of Hashem, as it's written: (Isiah 43:21) \"This nation I created to speak of my praise\".  These four empires that inherited rulership from Yisrael detract from the glory of Hashem in the this lower world.  For even if one is to find something within them which augments the honor of Hashem's name, as we will explain, for [as people say to a hornet] neither any of your stingers nor any of your honey does Hashem desire, for the essence of his Glory is when Hashem is One in his world and there is none beside him, and this particularly the other nations diminish.  No nation was created for this with the exception of Yisrael, for they also are one, as is hinted at in the verse: (Isiah 43,21) \"This nation I created to speak of my praise\".  For in this verse is the phrase \"This Nation\" [\"עם \"זו], and the Gematria of the word זו is 13, which is the also the Gematria of the word One [אחד].  For Yisrael are 13 tribes including the tribe of Levi, for Ephraim and Menashe are two (Of the twelve brothers, Yosef is split into his two sons which makes 13).  And thus, we find a parallel between the word One [אחד] and the tribes.  The Tribe of Levi is a singular tribe and separated from all the other tribes, and it a tribe unto itself, and it is represented by the א [Aleph] in the word אחד [One], for א represents singularity [as the Gematria of Aleph is 1].  And the ח [Chet] corresponds to the children of the Foremother [Rachel and Leah] for they are eight outside of Levi [Reuven, Shimon, Yehuda, Issaschar, Zvulin, Binyamin, Ephriam, Menashe] and this is hinted at in the ח of אחד.  The other 4 [ד] are the children of the maidservants [Billah and Zilpah who gave birth to Gad, Asher, Dan, and Naftali]. ", 
            "There the verse says \"This Nation\" [\"עם \"זו] to allude to the Oneness of Yisrael, \"they will speak of my praise\" the essential praise here is that Hashem should be One with nothing besides.  This [the number of tribes] is not accidental but purposefully done by Hashem from the outset of creation, for this nation [Yisrael] testifies that Hashem is One, as it is said in the Midrash that Yisrael testify about Hashem that he is One.  We don't have room to expand on this idea here.  But the four empires nullify the unity of God in the world, for the take rulership from Yisrael, and they [Yisrael] testify on the Unity of Hashem.  Therefore, at the end of the four empires, when Kingship/Royalty will return to Yisrael, the following is written: ", 
            "...(Obadiah 1:21) \"For liberators shall march up on Mount Zion to wreak judgment on Mount Esau; and dominion shall be the LORD’s.\" and in (Zecharia 14,9) \"Hashem will be King over all the world - on that day Hashem will be One and His Name will be One.\"  And this is as we have said, that the empires are four and this number represents a deviation from Unity.  For a central point which has no sides and is singular is One, as is known, and it is impossible that there could be two corresponding to a center, for a center is one and one alone.  And the directions are divergent, for this one stretches to the East, and this one the opposite direction to the West, and this to the South and this to the North.  If you think deeply you will realize that these four directions are definitionally divergent, and therefore they are the antithesis of Unity.  As such, Yisrael is concealed in a hint in the verse at the beginning of creation: \" בראשית\".  [This word, the first in the Torah, classically translated as \"in the beginning\" is deeply problematic from a grammatical standpoint.  The Maharal quotes Rashi quoting the Midrash on how to resolve this conflict with a different translation].  For the sake of Yisrael was the world created!   They are the primary dependent entity created by Hashem, and therefore it is appropriate that they be hinted to at the beginning of creation.  A similar idea is seen in the hinting of the four empires, which is a result of a definitional lack found in the creation through its inherent lack of being created [as we have at length seen above]. ", 
            "And further still you must understand, during Hashem's creation of is world it was appropriate that these empires alluded to.  This is because with the name י\"ה did Hashem create his world.  The world to come was created with a י from His Great Name, and this world was created with a ה from His Great Name.  This is because the Blessed Name י\"ה, the י from the Name י\"ה teaches that Hashem is One and there are no divisions in Him whatsoever.  This is because the י is small, which is to say it is indivisible and represents oneness, and therefore the י express this aspect of Hashem's Oneness.  The ה teaches, that one should not say that Hashem is One and not all things are within His control, and He is like all other things which are one without power over everything.  But Hashem is One and his power extends to everything.  This concept is expressed by the ה from His Great Name, because the ה has a \"ד\" and it also has a point [a י which represents Unity] within the \"ד\", and we have already said that the \"ד\" represents the expansion towards the four directions, and this teaches that Hashem is One AND has in his power everything.  Therefore, what that was said [by secular philosophers] that it is impossible that Hashem could be One in his world, for if this was the case He would have would have made Himself One in his world!  For always the derivative is obligated to be representative of the primary entity: it is definitional any derivative of fire is hot, so too coldness necessitates its derivatives be cold, and so on with all derivatives from primary entities each one must be representative of the primary entity.  And therefore, they [secular philosophers] decreed and said: 'From a primary entity which is One it is impossible that its derivative be anything but one! And consequently that we see in front of us a multiplicity of derivatives interchanging in the world, we can deduce that from the outset they were duplicitous [and therefore not One].'  Yet we have already explained this idea in another place and disproved this blunder.  On the contrary, the multiplicity of entities expresses a beginning in oneness!  We have explained this principle at length in the Sefer \"Gevuros Hashem\" in reference to the Korban Pesach, which was commanded to eat \"upon Matzah and bitter herbs\", look over there. [In quick summation, the Korbon Pesach is a sacrifice directly to Hashem, which is an action of explicit acknowledgement of Hashem's Oneness.  We eat this Korban between Matzah and Marror, for they are opposites.  Matzah represents freedom and Marror represents slavery.  Says the Maharal we purposefully eat the Korban Pesach between opposites as a way of declaring that the duplicity of this world is ultimately sourced in Oneness.] . This concept is expressed in the \"ה\" because the \"ה\" is made up of a \"ד\", and \"ד\" expressed the four directions, and an indivisible \"י\" within the \"ד\" which is one, corresponding to the center, and the one is connected with everything and is connected to everything.  Therefore with the letter \"ה\" did Hashem create this world, because this world is a world of multiplicity, even still it is one world [universe], for this multiplicity is ultimately unity.  The world to come is One entirely, so it was created with a  \"י\". ", 
            "And because these empires have importance within the world, therefore there must be within the world exactly four empires corresponding to the differentiation inherent in this world [as we've seen, represented by the number 4].  And there does exist in the world an aspect of unity, and corresponding to this is Yisrael, who are unified.  However, in truth, it's fitting that there should be these four empires connected and joined together with Yisrael, and enjoined to Yisrael until everything is one!  But on account of the lack inherent in a created entity, which is inherent within creation, which definitionally must lack perfection, it's impossible for our creation to be as such, for [as we have seen] the creating entity must be distinct from the created entity.   And specifically in our time before the Kingship of Yisrael.  On account of this [the lack of Kingship of Yisrael] we deviate from the Unity of Hashem until the four empires end and the King, the Messiah, comes.  Therefore vis-a-vis this lack, the four empires became distinct, but when their rulership ends, so the world will indeed become complete as has always been fitting.  Therefore, in conjunction with the creation of the world, these four empires were hinted at and concealed.  And also Yisrael, as it's written in the verse: \"And the LORD said Let there be light etc..\", and this is the light of the Messiah.  For all this [the unfolding of world history in this order] was necessary from the outset of creation, no later than when Hashem actually made his world.  Therefore Daniel said in his prophecy:  “In my vision at night, I saw the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea. Four mighty beasts different from each other emerged from the sea.\"  He [Daniel] said that these four winds were stirring up the great sea, as we have said, that these four are lie the four directions which differ, as we have explained.

            "The empire which is next [third], Daniel sees it as a leopard, because this empire corresponds to the third aspect within a Man.  For the third aspect is the שכל, as this empire contained wisdom and understanding, as we will explain at length.  For the entire essence of this empire was the search for wisdom, as is well known about the Greeks, as we will explain.  And therefore their attention was fixed upon the Torah and to nullify it from Yisrael, for they didn't want this wisdom, specifically in that it [the Torah] is a great wisdom and more elevated wisdom than human wisdom which they [the Greeks] had.  For it is the Torah, and it is the wisdom of everything.   And this wisdom, which is upon everything, is not suitable to the nations, as is explained in the Midrash.  So it says in the Midrash (Lamentations Rabbah 2:13): \"\"Her king and her leaders are in exile, Torah is no more\": if a man should say to you: 'There is wisdom among the nations', believe it. See! It is written: \"I will make the wise vanish from Edom, understanding from Esau’s mount (Obadiah 1:8)\". If a man should say: 'There is Torah among the nations', do not believe it, as it is written: \"Her king and her leaders are in exile, Torah is no more\".\"  And thus the empire, which are the Greeks, did not oppose Yisrael except for regarding their Torah, as we will explain this idea.   And this is what Daniel saw, that this third empire was in the form of a leopard, for this is the animal which is the most fierce, as it says in (Pirke Avos 5,20): \"Be fierce like a leopard\".  This is the character attribute which is suitable to those are ready for wisdom, as the Rabbis said (Pirke Avos 2:5): \"The intrinsically shamefaced cannot learn\".  Therefore also, the character attribute of Yisrael is fierceness, as we said in the Tractate Beitzah", 
            "(52b) \"It is taught in a Baraita in the name of Rabbi Meir: For what reason was the Torah given to the Jewish people? It is because they are [intrinsically] fierce.  A Sage of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught [the following with regard to the verse:] “From His right hand went a fiery law for them” (Deuteronomy 33:2); The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: These ones [the Jews] are fit to be given a fiery law. There are those who say [a different version of this baraita]: The ways of these people [the Jews] are like fire, as, were it not for the fact that the Torah was given to the Jewish people, no nation or tongue could stand up to them. And behold this is the same as what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: There are three fierce ones: The Jewish people among the nations; [the dog among animals; and the rooster among birds.]\".  The explanation, that because they [the Jews] have the Torah, and for this reason their ways are fire, for fire is [definitionally] aggressive and fierce, therefore Yisrael are the fierce ones among the nations.  And know, that matter is acted upon, and therefore human beings who are material entities, are definitionally not fierce and strong, but Yisrael who were given the Torah are fierce and strong entirely, and this concept we have explained in many place.  [This is based in abstract philosophical tenet.  In the Maharal's works he speaks of a dichotomy between matter and form, which in short the matter is the acted upon entity (i.e. the clay) while the form would be the acting entity (i.e. the hands).].  Therefore Daniel sees this nation [Greece], which is exceedingly eager for wisdom compared to any other nation, he sees it like a leopard which is the fiercest of all.  ", 
            "Therefore, this nation [Greece] sought to have the Rabbis write for them a Greek Torah, as is explained in the Tractace Megillah (Megillah 9a) [This is a fascinating Gemara, so we must bring it for you to see:\"There was an incident involving King Ptolemy, who assembled seventy-two Elders from the Sages of Israel, and put them into seventy-two separate rooms, and did not reveal to them for what purpose he assembled them, so that they would not coordinate their responses. He entered and approached each and every one, and said to each of them: Write for me a translation of the Torah of Moses your teacher. The Holy One, Blessed be He, placed wisdom in the heart of each and every one, and they all agreed to one common understanding. Not only did they all translate the text correctly, they all introduced the same changes into the translated text.].  Even though this nation [Greece] certainly has no portion in the Torah, as we have said, in any event they sought to write for themselves a Torah in their own language [Greek], for this would express that wisdom is suitable for them more than any other nation.  This is what Chazal [the Rabbis of the Talmud] (Megillah 9b): \"Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: This is the reason [that we allow a Sefer Torah to be written in Greek], as it is written (Bereshit 9:27): \"יפת אלוק'ם ליפת\" “God shall enlarge/extend Japheth” [יפת is etymologically similar to the Hebrew term for beauty (יפה)]. The beauty of Japheth shall be in the tents of Shem.\"  Which is to say, from the beauty of the children of Japheth, which is the Greek language, which is exceedingly beautiful [see Rashi on this Gemara], and meanwhile the Torah dwells in the tents of Shem, for it is permissible to have the Torah in their language.  And all of this is because they [the Greeks] have exceeding wisdom compared to all other nations.  And this comparative closeness itself was the cause of them wanting to annihilate the Torah, for a man is does not become jealous except of a man who resembles himself.  Therefore, they [the Greeks] wanted to annihilate the Torah.", 
            "...And therefore it is said that the third empire is connected to the beast which is a leopard with four wings (Daniel 7:6), for wisdom expands to all directions and wide and far, and it has no borders whatsoever, rather it extends to every place.  And therefore it is compared to the leopard which has four wings, for wings illustrate [the concept] of expansion in all four directions, and we have already explained this in another place, and it's clear in all places.  And therefore it is said about this nation [in the first vision of Daniel] (Daniel 2:39 \"[then yet a third kingdom, of bronze,] will rule over the whole earth\".  For after this nation possess wisdom, behold the intellect (שכל) expands throughout the entire world, as this is the concept of the intellect (שכל).  And therefore corresponding to the attribute of the intellect, they ruled over the entire world, and all was according to this attribute (the שכל).  And therefore this empire did not oppose Yisrael except in line with the Torah שכלי, and the Mitzvot of the G-dly Torah. [The Greek nation decreed specifically upon Bris Milah, on Rosh Chodesh, and Shabbat].  And thus all aspects of this third empire was to nullify from Yisrael the influence of G-dly Torah, and G-dly matters [supra-rational mitzvot] specifically. ", 
            "...This nation wanted that there should not be, G-d Forbid, a G-dly influence/element to Yisrael.", 
            "   This is what is said in the Midrash (Vikyra Rabbah 13:5) {R' Hartman suggest Bereshit Rabbah 2:4} \"the Greeks darkened the eyes of the Jews with their decrees, that they said to them, 'write on the horn of an ox that you don't have a portion in the G-d of Yisrael'.\" For the third empire said to Yisrael 'write on the horn of an ox' specifically [the Maharal is highlighting the specific and odd detail in Midrash's telling of the Greek decree to the Jewish people].  The explanation of this can be found in the [Talmudic] chapter 'One doesn't stand' (Berachos, 32b) \"[The Gemara cites a Midrash on the following verse from Isaiah, relating to the sin of the Golden Calf and Moses’ supplication for forgiveness:] “But Zion said: The Lord has forsaken me and the Lord has forgotten me. [Can a woman forget her suckling baby, that she would not have compassion for the child of her womb? These may forget, but you I will not forget”] (Isaiah 49:14–15). The Gemara seeks to clarify: Forsaken is the same as forgotten. [They are synonymous; why repeat the same idea twice?] Reish Lakish said: The community of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even when a man marries a second wife after his first wife, he certainly recalls the deeds of his first wife. Yet You have not only forsaken me, but You have forgotten me as well. \"Can a woman forget her suckling child?\"(Isaiah 49:15) The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: My daughter, I created twelve constellations in the firmament, and for each and every constellation I have created thirty armies, and for each and every army I have created thirty legions [ligyon], and for each and every legion I have created thirty infantry division leaders [rahaton], and for each and every infantry division leader I have created thirty military camp leaders [karton], and for each and every military camp leader I have created thirty leaders of forts [gastera], and on each and every leader of a fort I have hung three hundred and sixty-five thousand stars corresponding to the days of the solar year. And all of them I have created only for your sake; and you said 'the Lord has forsaken me and the Lord has forgotten me'? [The verse goes on to say: “Can a woman forget her suckling baby\"] The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the community of Israel: Have I forgotten the ram offerings and firstborn animals that you offered before Me in the desert? The community of Israel replied to Him: Master of the Universe, since there is no forgetfulness before the Throne of Your Glory, perhaps you will not forget my sin of the Golden Calf? God responded to Israel: “These (אלה ) too shall be forgotten.” (Isiah 49:15).   [“These” is a reference to the sin of the Golden Calf, regarding which Israel said: “These [אלה ] are your g-ds.”].  The community of Israel said before Him: Master of the Universe, since there is forgetfulness before the Throne of Your Glory, perhaps You will also forget the events revolving around the revelation at Sinai? G-d said to Israel: \"I [ואנכי] will not forget you\"(Isiah 49:15). [the revelation at Sinai, which began with: “I [ואנכי] am the Lord your G-d.”]. End quote.  [The Maharal will now quote a line from this Gemara to explain in greater depth].  Let us note that the quote from the Gemara of the Jewish people to Hashem was: \"Have I forgotten the ram offerings and firstborn animals that you offered before Me in the desert?\" yet, the quote could very well have been \"All the Korbanot which we have offered to you\" [the Maharal is highlighting the odd specificity of the Jewish people's statement, in which they refer to only ram offerings and firstborn animals, rather than all sacrifices].  This odd specificity comes to teach us, that there is no deviation of the Jewish people from Hashem, because they were created by Hashem in essence and first, and therefore there is no removal or deviation at all such that forgetting would be relevant to them [the Jewish people relative to G-d].  And because in the desert was the first Korban, for the first Korban is the principal and essence of the matter, and because it is first - for all firsts are principal, which is the essential, which is to say not incidental/happenstance, and matters which are principal and essential are not forgotten.  For a matter which is not primary, but which is merely incidental is indeed forgotten, because it is happenstance; but a matter which is the essential, it isn't forgotten.  And therefore [G-d] says \"Have I forgotten\", the essential matter, i.e. that [the Jewish people] \"brought Korbonot in front of me in the desert\".  And this [the essential and unforgettable nature of the Jewish bringing that first sacrifice to Hashem in the desert] teaches that the Jewish people are Servants to Hashem in their essence.  [Can a woman] \"forget\" [her suckling baby?] - this statement [above in the Talmud] should be read as wonder, for the question comes from the incompatibility of this [both in the verse referring to a woman and child also in its application of the Jews and Hashem] to forgetting, for it is a matter which is definitionally essential.", 
            "The forgetfulness that is being mentioned here, it is not akin to the forgetfulness found by humans, for G-d forbid should one say that Hashem could possible forget.  Rather the forgetfulness being mentioned here alludes to a deviation or removal from Hashem, as the verse says (Isiah 49:14) \"Zion says, 'The L-RD has forsaken me, My Lord has forgotten me.'\"  Behold [forgetting] alludes to the deviation or removal from Hashem.", 
            "And it says there (Isiah 49:15) \"Can a woman forget her baby?\" for there is no deviation to the fruit of the womb of a mother from the mother, for there is tremendous joining and connection between a mother and her child, therefore there is no deviation or separation between Yisrael from Hashem, due to the tremendous joining and connection between Yisrael with Hashem, from the aspect that they [the Jews] are considered children [of Hashem].  This concept is seen by their offering sacrifices in front of Hashem in the desert, for it's not regular or common for bulls [for the sacrifices] to be found within the desert, and even still they [the Jewish people] sacrificed.  And all of this is because the essence of Yisrael is that they are created for this [a connected conjoining with Hashem], and it is impossible for them [the Jews] [to exist] without this, and specifically in such that in the beginning when Hashem took Yisrael as a nation, therefore at the beginning as soon as they leave, even if they were in the desert, so they brought sacrifices, and this connection illustrates the essential aspect of Yisrael.

            "And there is also a deviation in this matter, in such that Yisrael were separated from Hashem through the act of the [Golden] Calf, that immediately after [Hashem] took them out of Egypt, and gave them the Torah, they made the Calf.  And this illustrates that there is separation and deviation for Yisrael in a matter from Hashem, away from the essence of Yisrael; for if there was to Yisrael a complete connection to Hashem vis-a-vis their essence, they never would have made the Calf in the first place, and in such that Hashem took Yisrael as a nation, and immediately after he takes them from Egypt, and gives them the Torah, they make the Calf, and this concept teaches that certainly there is here [in the relationship between Yisrael and Hashem] deviation and separation.  And just as there is to them [the Jews] a connection and closeness to Hashem vis-a-vis their essence, so too there is also to them separation vis-a-vis their essence.  And this is because just like a father has a connection and relationship to his son which is bidirectional, for this one is the father, and this one the son, so too there is to them a distinction on these ground.  For a father and a son they are essentially different, for this one is the father and this one the son, and this is considered separation.  And therefore certainly there is separation and deviation vis-a-vis this, and therefore they [the Greeks] said to Yisrael (Vayikra Rabbah 13:5) \"'Write on the horn of an ox that you don't have a portion in the G-d of Yisrael'.\" For from the aspect of the Calf, which Yisrael made the Calf immediately after [Hashem] gave them the Torah, this matter teaches that there is deviation and separation with their [Yisrael's] essential makeup.  And on this it was said that (Isiah 49:15) \"Though she might forget\" [This is the latter half of the verse quoted above which said \"Can a mother forget her child?  While that phrase rhetorically suggests no, this latter half of the verse seems to suggest indeed it yes is possible.  Maharal explains].  The explanation of the word \"might\" is that it [is a word that expresses] a difficult language,   "

        "The reason for its establishment on 25 Kislev": [
            "And it was appropriate that it would be on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, since the light emerges at that time. Because it was on the twenty-fifth of Elul that the light was created in the world, since the world was created on the first of Tishrei, and on it was created the Man that was created in the six days of creation; and the light that was created on the first day, it was on this twenty-fifth day of Elul that the light was created. And light has four boundaries:  One boundary, [which is] that the light is at the end of its increasing and the darkness is at the end of its contraction, and from there the light begins to contract and the darkness to increase, and this is Tamuz [i.e., summer solstice]. And there is a [second] boundary where the light and the darkness are equal, and from there on the light begins to contract and the darkness to increase, and this is the month of Tishrei, since at that time the light and the darkness are equal and from there on the darkness increases and overcomes the light [i.e., autumnal equinox]. And there is a [third] boundary where the darkness overcomes the light completely, and this is in the Month of Tevet, and from then on the light begins to increase [i.e., winter solstice]. And there is a [fourth] boundary where the light and the darkness are equal and afterward the light proceeds to increase, and this is in the month of Nisan [i.e., vernal equinox], since at that time the light and the darkness are equal and afterward the light increasingly strengthens until the month of Tamuz, and thus it repeats. And behold, the beginning of the light that emerges from the darkness is on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, since the creation of the light of the world was at a time in which the day and night were equal, and this was on the twenty-fifth of Elul - or on the twenty-fifth of Adar according to the opinion (Rosh HaShanah 11a) that the world was created in Nisan - in which case the beginning of the light was on the twenty-fifth of Kislev since at that time the light began to increase. And therefore the miracle with the oil was made, and the light on the twenty-fifth was even if there was no oil to light, and the miracle was for all eight [days] when it was at that time which is singled out for the beginning of the light."

        "Aspect of the Sea and the Forest Connected to the Kingdoms": [
            "As such, it was said in Daniel (7:2-7)- “In my vision at night, I saw the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea. Four mighty beasts different from each other emerged from the sea.\"  And it is said these [specifically] four winds stirring up the sea as we explained, for these four are like the four directions which [represent] differentiation [in this world] as we have explained.  And these four winds beget these four animals from the sea, because each nation is considered next to Yisrael like the sea, for they are not from a settled domain, and Yisrael is compared to dry land [which is settled].  It says in the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah: 13,5) ' \"And four might beasts different from each other emerged from the sea\" - If you [the Jews] are meritorious, from the sea, and if not from the forest.  The beasts from the sea, for when they rise from the sea they already begin to die, whereas if they rise from the forest they aren't weak from the outset.'  This is the explanation, the sea is far from the dry land, and if Yisrael are meritorious, so the nations will lack true existence, like any entity within the sea which lacks true existence.  It's for this reason that fish, which are from the sea, do not require Shechita [any ritual slaughtering], and this is because they lack existence, for existence is found within being settled.  Therefore if Yisrael merit, the empires don't have strength, and they arise from the sea.  As it is said, if from their beginning of their existence they lacked strength and power, so it must be that they arose from the sea.  And if [Yisrael] do not merit, so they will arise from the forest, which is settled.  Even if the forest is separate from settlement as well, for within a forest one doesn't find human beings, only wild animals, but still in any event it [forest] is not entirely separate from settlement.  Therefore it says [in Daniel] \"And four winds stirring upon the sea\".  ", 
            "And it is such that when Daniel sees the empires, he sees four beasts, for in this manner it is appropriate that that the four empires possess dominion.  And this is, because Man has the power and dominion over beasts, as it is written in the Torah [Bereshit 1, 28, 2 19].  And therefore it is appropriate that the empires of the world should appear in image and depiction of man.  It's just that the dominion of these four empires are lacking the virtue of G-dliness which is distinct to Man, and from this aspect that they are lacking the virtue of G-dliness, their power is without G-dliness.  Therefore, they [the empires] appear in the depiction of animals, for beasts lack this power of transcendent G-dliness.  But power without transcendent G-dliness is actually stronger [in terms of brute force], which is something we also see within these empires.  Therefore Daniel sees these them in the image and depiction of beasts.  And when [Daniel] sees the Kingship of the King the Messiah, he sees him in the image and depiction of a human.  For after he sees the empires in the form of four beasts, he sees the Kingship of Yisrael in image and depiction of a human, as it is said (Daniel, 7,13) \"One like a human being came\" for the Kingship of the King the Messiah, will be entire G-dly, therefore it [Yisrael] is called \"The Son of Man\".

        "The Uniqueness of the Fourth Kingdom": [], 
        "Comparison of the Kingdoms to the Human Body": [
            "In truth, when one sees Nebuchadnezzar, the evil one, of the four empires, one sees him in the depiction and image of a person.  As Daniel sees in another dream, [and is called directly in from of Nebuchadnezzar to share this dream.  In it he shares a different vision of Nebuchadnezzar.  This occurs several chapters before the dream we have been analyzing, which is Chapter 7, - in Chapter 2 of Daniel].  (2:32-33) \"The head of that statue was of fine gold; its breast and arms were of silver; its belly and thighs, of bronze. its legs were of iron, and its feet part iron and part clay.\"  For by Nebuchadnezzar there was not the same lack as by the other [three] empires, and therefore he [Daniel] sees him in the image and representation of a Man, just in the same way that [in our dream] Daniel saw the King the Messiah.  This is a huge topic with a deep explanation, as we are about to explain.  Actually, it was appropriate that all four of these empires should appear as one man.  For a Man has four parts: the first - the שכלי capacity [intellectual/cerebral/spiritual].  Lower than the שכל - the נפשי [emotional] capacity.  Lower than the נפש  -- the גופני [bodily/physical] capacity - which is entirely intertwined in the body, and these are the three parts.  And there is here one other capacity which is connected, this is the the one that encompasses all these three together, as we are about to explain right now.  We have already explained this concept of these four aspects that make up a person in many place, for example in the Pirkei Avos (4, 23) in the Mishna that speaks about jealousy, lust, and honor.  There is not space here to elaborate on this topic, but these ideas are known to anybody with wisdom.  ", 
            "But each of these capacities are not an attribute essential to man in his essentially being Man, which is to say that he was created in the Image of G-d.  For a man has a further attribute which is essential to him being Man,  this is his G-dly Image, which encompasses everything about him, and this wasn't given to these four empires.  This idea is known, for as the Rabbis of the Gemara say (Yvamos, 61a) \"You [the Jewish people] are called Man, but the nations are not called Man\".  In truth this topic we explained in it's proper place, for the Image of G-d was not given only to Yisrael, yet neither was it given to the nations.  For these four empires correspond to the capacities of Man, and therefore when Nebuchadnezzar sees the dream [first dream of Daniel] he sees these four empires in the depiction of Man.  For the verse says (Yechezkiel 34:31) \"Men you are\" - which is to say you are called Man, but the nations are not called Man.  For in many places [in Torah] are we [Yisrael] called Man.  But rather the explanation is this, that by Yisrael the Image of G-d is essential/primary and everything else is ancillary/secondary with respect to the Image.  For the this (G-dly) Image is distinct from the body, and therefore everything is negligible next to it.  And Nebuchadnezzar did not see this Image without a body, rather he saw the Image standing in gold, and silver, and copper, and iron.  For the nations of the world do indeed have an Image, which is intertwined with the physical.  And therefore, he sees this Image, which has a head of gold, and of arms of silver.  And gold and silver and copper and iron are the essential/primary, and the Image is negligible next to them, for the Image isn't distinct as is with Yisrael.  But when Daniel sees the Kingship of Yisrael, he only sees the Image alone, no bodily component whatsoever, as it said \"One like a human being Came with the clouds of heaven\" and what came through here was nothing except the Image of G-d.  But when Nebuchadnezzar the Evil sees the four empires, he sees them in the Image of gold, and of silver, and of copper, and of iron, because the Image is not the essential/primary, rather it [the Image] is almost painted upon the gold and silver, and the form isn't the essential/primary whatsoever.  Here lies your explanation.   ", 
            "For with certainty that when [Daniel in first dream shared with Nebuchadnezzar] sees these four empires in the Image of Man, for these four empires are like the capacities within a person.  The first is the body.  The second - the נפש [emotional].  This capacity, even though it is very similar to the body of a person, it is not imprinted within the body, as the capacity of the body is.  The third - שכל [mind], which is entirely distinct from the body.  as is true with any true thought/abstraction which is definitionally transcendent/distinct.  And even if it seems clear that the capacity of the שכל within a person is incredibly lofty in its value, in any event it's not so dominant and power [for the נפש is the dominant force in the average person].  And therefore, this is the order of the empires, for the  נפשי capacity is the most active force within a person, as is known.  And below it is the bodily capacity which isn't so activated.  And the שכלי capacity, even though it certainly is higher, but the power of dominance must come through its connection with the נפשי capacity.", 
            "Therefore, one must give the נפשי capacity to the first empire, for the first empire possessed an importance and dominance that was superlative, as it was said about them [this empire] by Daniel (2, 37): \"You, O king—king of kings.\"  And therefore Daniel also said in his second vision (2, 38):  \"[and to whom He has given dominion over them all]—you are the head of gold.  Therefore it says:", 
            "(Daniel 7, 4): \"but had eagles’ wings\" for the eagle which flourishes in its height, as we shall explain, and this corresponds to the component of the נפש with a person, for it is the dominant capacity", 
            "The second empire was the Persian Empire, which is the bodily capacity within a person; a capacity which is actually lower than the first one.  The entire concept of the capacity of the body is that is perpetually and definitionally lacking, and that it is perpetually receiving.  This capacity corresponds to the second empire.  Therefore Daniel relays about this empire (Daniel 7:5): \"Then I saw a second, different beast, which was like a bear\"...And they said in the [Talmudic] Chapter \"Ten Classes\" (Kiddushin, 72a): \"And behold a second beast, similar to a bear” (Daniel 7:5). Rav Yosef taught: These are Persians, who eat and drink copious amounts like a bear, and are corpulent like a bear, and grow hair like a bear, and have no rest like a bear.  The explanation is that they [bears] seek always to swallow, this is their temperament.  And so was it written about this [Persian] empire in Megillas Ester (Ester 10,1): \"King Ahasuerus imposed tax on the mainland and the islands.\"  What in actuality did that verse come to teach us? That the king imposed a tax on the land? [All kings do this, why would the verse waste ink sharing this information?].  Rather, what it is coming to say, is that the entire power of Ahasuerus was derived from his sense of lacking, and he sought perpetually to fulfill his נפש from wealth, and this was the essence of the second empire.  And so Daniel about this beast (Daniel 7:5) \"it was told, ‘Arise, eat much meat!’\".  And so they said [in the Gemara] (Megillah 11a) on why he was called \"Ahasuerus\" אחשורוש: 'And Rabbi Ḥanina said: The name alludes to the fact that everyone became poor [rash] in his days, [as it is stated: “And the king Ahasuerus imposed a tax on the mainland” (Esther 10:1).]'.  And all of this was because he [Ahasuerus] wanted to fulfil his נפש from his bodily desires.  And such that Haman understood this aspect of Ahasuerus, he [Haman] wanted also that he [Ahasuerus] would sell him Yisrael for money [The following is a direct quote from Megillas Ester about Haman's proposition (Ester 3:9): \"If it please Your Majesty, let an edict be drawn for their destruction, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the stewards for deposit in the royal treasury.”].  For this is the concept of the power of Ahasuerus, for through this, G-d Forbid, Yisrael could have been swallowed up.  And because Ahasuerus is perpetually desiring to swallow up, therefore Haman says (Ester 3:11) \"[And the king said,] 'The money is given to you [and the people yours to do with as you see fit.”].  And he didn't say 'I don't want this money of yours', rather it must be that 'I [Ahasuerus] accepted the money from you [Haman] and I will return and give it to you.  But he didn't want to hold on to your money, because this would have certainly been an insult to him [Ahasuerus], to accept money, and to give another nation over to be killed simply because of money.  Rather [this whole money exchange] was because of the love of money, so he accepted and returned and gave the money to him [Haman].  And we already explained in its place this topic.  The general principle here is that the concept of the second empire is the desire to swallow everything.        "
