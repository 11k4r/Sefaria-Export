                "Great destruction comes to the structures of the soul when the inner light of 'the time for silence' appears, when the fullness of the beautiful glory and heavy burden of the highest holy muteness fills the soul, if one rebels against it and breaks out in speech. This rebellion against the sovereignty of silence destroys all its buildings, all the storehouse of simplicity and rectitude, of depth and transcendent communication - everything shatters in fragments. Afterwards, if one wants to rebuild that which was destroyed, they must establish everything anew, and in that moment a discerning person is silent. In truth when silence is honored in the moment of its appearance, then it asserts its rule, establishes its hall, penetrating to the deepest depths of its abyss and bringing out glorious ramifications and mighty branchings with a powerful and refreshing vital force - the shrubs (sichim) are filled with strength and new expressions of the lips (Is. 57:19) come. Then the time for speech begins, in its beautiful glory, and the spirit of silence serves as the mediating angel that works upon the flood of speech, flowing like a river in all its preciousness and abundant wealth. \"I will create new expressions of the lips: Peace, peace, both far and near, says the Lord. And I will heal him. (Is. 57:19) \"...Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.\" (Ezekiel 47:12) "

                "Once can know their spiritual standing by the clarity of their expression. The more that the neshama’s light lives within them, to that extent they will feel how each word shoots like an arrow, like a flood of living waters, and how it is drawn from the source of life, making its impact in the world. The particular quality of speech's affect is measured by the specific standard of the neshama’s elevation, each according to their level. "

                "When one speaks of sacred matters, but feels discomfort because of the holy manifestation pouring out within, know that the impure soul is gradually shrinking away. It is this soul which is pained by its reduction, and of its own accord goodness progressively overcomes. Through this very knowledge, through faithfulness to it and delving deeply in it, the pure soul awakens in joy and knows that it she becoming holy, rising up, spreading out more and more. “The LORD is their strength; He is a stronghold for the deliverance of His anointed,” (Psalms 28:8) “…and my heart exulted, so I will glorify Him with my song.” (Ps. 28:7)"
