                "Regarding the fourth question, you asked about the “Leshem yihud” (“For the sake of unification”) formula that has recently proliferated and has been printed in prayer book. My response is that before you ask me about the formula of its recitation, you should ask if one may pronounce “for it is good” over its recitation. In my opinion, this is a terrible sickness in our generation. Previous generation knew nothing of this formula and did not recite it. Rather, they toiled their whole lives in Torah and the commandments, all in accordance with the Torah and halakhic authorities, whose words spring from the source of living water, the sea of Talmud. It is said of them: “The innocence of the upright shall guide them.” It is they who bore fruit in heaven, and their kindness reaches above the heavens. But in the present generation, they have abandoned God’s Torah and the source of living water—the two Talmuds, Bavli and Yerushalmi—to dig broken wells. In their haughtiness, each deigns to say, “I am the visionary. The gates of heaven are open to me. The world exists on my behalf.” These are the destroyers of a generation.  Of this orphaned generation I say: “The ways of God are upright: the righteous will walk on them, and the Hasidim will stumble upon them.”  I have much to say about this, but just as it is a mitzva to say something that will be heeded, so too it is a mitzva not to say something that will not be heeded. May God have mercy on us.", 
                "As to the content of your words: “one must articulate that one’s intentions (kavanot) are in according with esoteric wisdom, bringing proof from the beginning of Zevahim, which states that it must be articulated explicitly that a bill of divorce is for the purpose of divorce, and from vows, which must be articulated explicitly, even if one has resolved in his heart.” I say that the prooftexts undermine your contention. For there a distinction is made between a woman and a sacrificial offering: since most women are not about to get divorced, the intent must be made explicit. Offerings, however, are presumed to be used for their intended purpose, so it is acceptable even if the purpose remains unarticulated. Our commandments are akin to sacrifices, and can be presumed to be done with the proper intent. The case of vows merely means that thought without action is meaningless. However, an action that can be presumed to be done for its own sake needs no assistance. I say that we may argue a fortiori. In the case of sacrificial offerings, even though it is a mitzva to explicitly state the purpose, as the Sages said in Zevahim ad loc.: “An offering is brought with six intentions….” Nevertheless, the Jewish court stipulated that he should not state his intention, lest he state the wrong intention. That is, he should not say nor think, even in his heart, as stated explicitly in Tosafot on Zevahim 2b s.v. “kiyemu beit din.” Rather, he should perform the act of worship and not think about it at all. Now, if in that case they instructed that one should not recite his intention out of concern that he will recite the wrong intention, and that he should not think about his intention lest he think about the wrong intention, even though it is a farfetched concern that one will confuse the correct intention from the incorrect intention, then certainly (kal va-homer) when it comes to intention for prayer and mitzvot, where there are many “narrow bays and shallow waters”  and many concerns for heresy, which we have seen empirically, then it is obvious that this should be abolished, and one should have no intention. It is sufficient that one perform a mitzva for the sake of performing a mitzva.", 
                "As for what your Excellency wrote, namely, that it is good for there to be a strong bond between one’s thought, speech, and actions—The Men of the Great Assembly instituted our blessings and prayers, and there is nothing that is not alluded to in the formula of the prayer or blessing. A blessing constitutes the awakening of one’s thought and speech, so any mitzva that is preceded by a blessing needs no recitation beforehand other than the blessing. And for anything that is not preceded by a blessing, it is my custom to say: “I hereby do this to uphold the commandment of my Creator.” This is sufficient, and there is no need for anything more. “Intention” is merely [awareness of] the meaning of the words. All of the supernal repairs (tikunim) happen on their own, by virtue of our actions.", 
                "Regarding your Excellency’s debate about whether the formula “To unify the name yud-hey with vav-hey” constitutes [forbidden] articulation of God’s name, in which you discuss Tosafot’s position on whether the prohibition on articulating God’s name applies to the first two letters—I recall that in my youth I heard those people saying the name yud-hey and vav-hey in full. It certainly does not constitute articulation of God’s name. However, I have already expressed my opinion that silence is preferable, so that the matter fades away. Even in thought, one should only think of the meaning of the words. In this way, one will walk securely and will not stumble over any matter. It is not necessary to write at greater length of such matters. I am succinct due to much preoccupation. The words of one who seeks peace. "
