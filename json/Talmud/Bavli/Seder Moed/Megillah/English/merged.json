            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Megilla is read on the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> eleventh </span>of Adar. The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From where do we</span> derive this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>? The Gemara expresses surprise at the question: What room is there to ask: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From where do we</span> derive this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>? The reason is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as we intend</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to say further on: The Sages were lenient with </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the villages </span>and allowed them <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to advance </span>their reading of the Megilla <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to the day of assembly, so that they</span> would be free to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">supply water and food to their</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> brethren in the cities </span>on the day of Purim. Accordingly, the Megilla is read on the eleventh due to a rabbinic enactment. ", 
            "The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is what we said, </span>i.e., this is what we meant when we asked the question: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Now, all of these </span>days when the Megilla may be read <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were enacted by the members of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Great Assembl</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">y</span> when they established the holiday of Purim itself. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As, if it enters your mind </span>to say <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> members of the Great Assembly enacted </span>only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the fourteenth and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> fifteenth </span>as days for reading the Megilla, is it possible that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span>later <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Sages came and uprooted an ordinance </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that was enacted by the members of the Great Assembly? </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class=\"it-text\">Eduyyot</span> 1:5) that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a rabbinical court cannot rescind the statements of another rabbinical </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">court, unless it is superior to it in wisdom and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in number</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?</span> No subsequent court was ever greater than the members of the Great Assembly, so it would be impossible for another court to rescind the enactments of the members of the Great Assembly.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is obvious </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all </span>these days <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were enacted by </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the members of the Great Assembly, </span>and the question is: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Where is the allusion </span>to this in the Bible? The Megilla itself, which was approved by the members of the Great Assembly, mentions only the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Shemen bar</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Abb</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>It is alluded to when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">To confirm these days of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Purim in their times</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Esther 9:31). The phrase “in their times” indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they enacted many times for them </span>and not only two days.", 
            "The Gemara objects: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This </span>verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> necessary for its own </span>purpose, to teach that the days of Purim must be observed at the proper times. The Gemara responds: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, let the verse say: </span>To confirm these days of Purim in its <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time. What is </span>the significance of the term <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their times,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>in the plural? It indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">many times </span>were established for the reading of the Megilla. ", 
            "The Gemara objects: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">still, </span>the plural term is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">necessary </span>to indicate that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time of this </span>walled city <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is not </span>the same as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the time of that </span>unwalled town, i.e., Purim is celebrated on different days in different places. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, let the verse say: Their time, </span>indicating that each place celebrates Purim on its respective day. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What </span>is the significance of the compound plural <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their times”? Learn </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from this </span>term that although the verse (Esther 9:21) specifies only two days, the Megilla may, at times, be read on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all of </span>the days enumerated in the mishna. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: If so, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>that the plural term indicates <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">many times</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> and the Megilla may be read even earlier than the eleventh of Adar. The Gemara rejects this argument: The compound plural <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their times,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>should be understood as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">similar to </span>the simple plural term, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their time. Just as </span>the term <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their time </span>can be understood to refer to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two </span>days, indicating that each location reads the Megilla in its respective time on the fourteenth or the fifteenth of Adar, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so too,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their times</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>should be understood as referring to only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two </span>additional days when the Megilla may be read.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Say </span>that these two added days are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the twelfth and the thirteenth </span>of Adar. How is it derived that the Megilla may be read on the eleventh as well? The Gemara answers: It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said </span>in a different context: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The thirteenth </span>of Adar <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is a time of assembly for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> as it was on that day that the Jews assembled to fight their enemies, and the main miracle was performed on that day. Consequently, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there is no need </span>for a special derivation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to include it </span>as a day that is fit for reading the Megilla. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Here too, </span>since <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the thirteenth </span>of Adar <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is a time of assembly for</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> all, there is no need </span>for a special derivation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> include it </span>among the days when the Megilla may be read.", 
            "The Gemara objects: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And say </span>that the two additional days are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the sixteenth and the seventeenth</span> of Adar. The Gemara responds: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it shall not pass</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Esther 9:27), indicating that the celebration of Purim is not delayed until a later date.", 
            "Having cited and discussed the opinion of Rav Shemen bar Abba, the Gemara cites another answer to the question of where the verses allude to the permissibility of reading the Megilla on the days enumerated in the mishna. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: </span>These dates are alluded to when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> days on which the Jews rested from their enemies</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Esther 9:22). The term <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">days</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>is referring to the two days that are explicitly mentioned in the previous verse, i.e., the fourteenth and the fifteenth. The term <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the days</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>comes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to include </span>two additional days, i.e., <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the eleventh and twelfth </span>of Adar.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And say </span>that the two additional days are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> twelfth and thirteenth </span>of Adar. How is it derived that the Megilla may be read on the eleventh as well? In answer to this question, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: The thirteenth </span>of Adar <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is a time of assembly </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for all, and there is no need </span>for a special derivation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to include it </span>as a day fit for reading. The Gemara objects: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Say </span>that these additional days are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sixteenth and seventeenth </span>of Adar. This suggestion is rejected: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it shall not pass.”</span>", 
            "Since two derivations were offered for the same matter, the Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the reason </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shmuel bar </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Naḥmani did not state </span>that the days enumerated in the mishna are fit for reading the Megilla <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">based upon </span>the term <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in their times,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rav Shemen bar Abba? The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He does </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not learn </span>anything from the distinction between the terms <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their time, </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their times. </span>Therefore, the verse indicates only that there are two days when the Megilla may be read. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what is the reason </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Shemen bar Abba did </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not state </span>that the days enumerated in the mishna are fit for reading the Megilla <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">based upon </span>the term <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the days,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani? The Gemara answers: He could have <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> you: That </span>verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is written </span>as a reference <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>future <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">generations, </span>and it indicates that just as the Jews rested on these days at that time, they shall rest and celebrate on these days for all generations.", 
            "§ With regard to the mishna’s ruling that the Megilla may be read on the day of assembly, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">unattributed</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> Most unattributed statements of <span class=\"it-text\">tanna’im</span> were formulated by Rabbi Akiva’s students and reflect his opinions. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he derives </span><span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> based on the distinction that he draws between the terms <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, their time, and their times. However, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Sages say: One may read </span>the Megilla <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">only in </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its </span>designated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, </span>i.e., the fourteenth of Adar.", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">objection </span>based upon the following <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda said: When </span>is one permitted to read the Megilla from the eleventh to the fifteenth of Adar? One may read on these dates <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at a time when the years are established </span>properly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and the Jewish people dwell </span>securely <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in their </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">land. </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, nowadays, since </span>people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">look </span>to the reading of the Megilla and use it to calculate when Passover begins, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may read </span>the Megilla <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">only in its </span>designated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, </span>so as not to cause confusion with regard to the date of Passover, which is exactly one month from the day after Purim. ", 
            "The Gemara analyzes this <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">In</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> accordance with whose </span>opinion did <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda </span>issue his ruling? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If we say that it is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Akiva, </span>whose opinion is expressed in the mishna, there is a difficulty, as Rabbi Akiva holds that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even nowaday</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> this ordinance applies. </span>According to Rabbi Akiva, it is permitted for residents of villages to read the Megilla on the day of assembly even nowadays, as he did not limit his ruling to times when the Jewish people dwell securely in their land.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, is it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Sages, </span>who disagreed with Rabbi Akiva? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And, </span>nevertheless, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at least when the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> years are established </span>properly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and the Jewish people dwell </span>securely <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in their land, </span>the Megilla <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is read </span>even prior to the fourteenth, as the Sages disagree only about the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> nowadays.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And they gave the sense,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these are </span>the divisions of the text into separate <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">verses.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And they caused them </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to understand the reading,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these are the cantillation notes, </span>through which the meaning of the text is further clarified. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">some say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these are the </span>Masoretic <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tradition</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span> with regard to the manner in which each word is to be written. This indicates that the Aramaic translation already existed at the beginning of the Second Temple period, well before the time of Onkelos. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The </span>ancient Aramaic translation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was forgotten and then </span>Onkelos came and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">reestablished it. </span>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is different </span>about the translation of Prophets? Why is it that when Onkelos revealed the translation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of the Torah, </span>Eretz Yisrael <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did not quake, and </span>when he revealed the translation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of the Prophets, it quaked? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The </span>meaning of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matters </span>discussed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the Torah is clear</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> and therefore its Aramaic translation did not reveal the meaning of passages that had not been understood previously. Conversely, in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Prophets, there are matters that are clear and there are</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> matters that are obscure, </span>and the Aramaic translation revealed the meaning of obscure passages. The Gemara cites an example of an obscure verse that is clarified by the Aramaic translation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it is written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">On that day shall </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Zechariah 12:11).", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>with regard to that verse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Yosef said: Were it not for the </span>Aramaic <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">translation of this verse, we would not have known what</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it is saying, </span>as the Bible does not mention any incident involving Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. The Aramaic translation reads as follows: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">On that day, the mourning in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Ahab</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, son of Omri, who was slain by Hadadrimmon, son of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Tavrimon, in Ramoth-Gilead, and like the mourning for Josiah</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, son of Amon, who was slain by Pharaoh the lame</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in the valley of Megiddon. </span>The translation clarifies that the verse is referring to two separate incidents of mourning, and thereby clarifies the meaning of this verse. ", 
            "§ The Gemara introduces another statement from the same line of tradition. The verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the men who were with me did not see the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">vision; but a great trembling fell upon them, so that </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they fled to hide themselves</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Daniel 10:7). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Who were these</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> men? </span>The term “men” in the Bible indicates important people; who were they? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say</span> that it was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba </span>who said: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">These</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> are </span>the prophets <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</span>", 
            "The Gemara comments: In certain ways <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they, </span>the prophets, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were greater than him, </span>Daniel, and in certain ways <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he, </span>Daniel, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was greater than</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> them. They were greater than him, as they were </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prophets and he was not a prophet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi were sent to convey the word of God to the Jewish people, while Daniel was not sent to reveal his visions to others. In another way, however, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was greater than them, as he saw </span>this vision, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they did not see </span>this vision, indicating that his ability to perceive obscure and cryptic visions was greater than theirs.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since they did not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">see </span>the vision, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what is the reason that they were </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">frightened? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Even though they did not see</span> the vision, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their guardian angels saw </span>it, and therefore they sensed that there was something fearful there and they fled.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ravina said: Learn from </span>this incident that with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one who is frightene</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> for no apparent reason, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although he does not see </span>anything menacing, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his guardian angel sees </span>it, and therefore he should take steps in order to escape the danger. The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is his remedy? He should recite </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Shema</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>which will afford him protection. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if he is standing </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in a place of filth, </span>where it is prohibited to recite verses from the Torah, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he should distance himself four </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">cubits from his </span>current <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">location </span>in order to escape the danger. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if </span>he is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>able to do so, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">let him say the following </span>incantation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The goat of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughterhouse is fatter than I am, </span>and if a calamity must fall upon something, it should fall upon it. ", 
            "§ After this digression, the Gemara returns to the exposition of a verse cited above. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Now </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you have said </span>that the phrases <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">every province</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">every city</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>appear <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span>the purposes of midrashic <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">exposition, for what </span>exposition do the words <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">every family</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>appear in that same verse (Esther 9:28)? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: </span>These words come <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to include the priestly and Levitical</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> families, </span>and indicate <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that they cancel their service </span>in the Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and come to hear the reading of the Megilla</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As Rav Yehuda</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav said: The priests at their </span>Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">service</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the Levites on their platform </span>in the Temple, where they sung the daily psalm, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and the Israelites at their</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> watches, </span>i.e., the group of Israelites, corresponding to the priestly watches, who would come to Jerusalem and gather in other locations as representatives of the entire nation to observe or pray for the success of the Temple service, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all cancel their service and come to hear the reading </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of the Megilla. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is also taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The priests at their service, the Levites on the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">platform, and the Israelites at their watches, all cancel their </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">service and come to hear the reading of the Megilla. </span>The Sages of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the house of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">relie</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> upon the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> stated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">here </span>and determined <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that one cancels</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> his Torah study and comes to hear the reading of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the Megilla. </span>They derived this principle by means of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">a</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">fortiori</span> inference <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from the </span>Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">service: Just as </span>one who is engaged in performing <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">service </span>in the Temple, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which is </span>very <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">important, cancels </span>his service in order to hear the Megilla, is it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not all the more so </span>obvious that one who is engaged in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Torah study </span>cancels his study to hear the Megilla? ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Is the </span>Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">service more important than </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Torah study? Isn’t it written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it came to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pass when Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood over </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">against him </span>with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went over to him and said to him: Are you for us, or for our adversaries? And he said, No, but I am captain of the host of the Lord, I have come now. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and bowed down</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Joshua 5:13–14). ", 
            "The Gemara first seeks to clarify the incident described in the verse. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">How did </span>Joshua <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> this, </span>i.e., how could he bow to a figure he did not recognize? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> say: It is prohibited for a person to greet his</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> fellow at nigh</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">t</span> if he does not recognize him, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we are concerned that perhaps it is a demon? </span>How did Joshua know that it was not a demon? The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">There it was different, as </span>the visitor <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: But I am captain of the host </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of the Lord.</span>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Perhaps </span>this was a demon <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and he lied? </span>The Gemara answers: It <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is learned </span>as a tradition that demons <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do not utter</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the name of Heaven for naught, </span>and therefore since the visitor had mentioned the name of God, Joshua was certain that this was indeed an angel.", 
            "As for the angel’s mission, the Gemara explains that the angel <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to </span>Joshua: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yesterday, </span>i.e., during the afternoon, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you neglected the afternoon daily offerin</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">g</span> due to the impending battle, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and now, </span>at night, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you have neglected Torah</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> study, </span>and I have come to rebuke you. Joshua <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to him: For which of these </span>sins <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">have you </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">come? He said to him: I have come now, </span>indicating that neglecting Torah study is more severe than neglecting to sacrifice the daily offering. Joshua <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immediately </span>determined to rectify the matter, as the verses states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Joshua lodged that night</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Joshua 8:9) <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the midst of the valley </span>[<span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ha’emek</span>]” (Joshua 8:13), and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>"

            "This <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches that he spent the night in the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">depths </span>[<span class=\"gemarra-italic\">be’umeka</span>] <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">halakha</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>i.e., that he spent the night studying Torah with the Jewish people. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Shmuel bar Unya said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Torah study is greater </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">than sacrificing the daily offerings, as it is stated: “I </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">have come now” </span>(Joshua 5:14), indicating that the angel came to rebuke Joshua for neglecting Torah study and not for neglecting the daily offering. Consequently, how did the Sages of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi determine that the Temple service is more important than Torah study?", 
            "The Gemara explains that it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not difficult. This </span>statement, with regard to the story of Joshua, is referring to Torah study <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> masses</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> which is greater than the Temple service. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">That</span> statement of the Sages of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring to Torah study <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by an individual, </span>which is less significant than the Temple service.

            "The Gemara asks: Is the Torah study <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of an individual a light </span>matter? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Didn</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">On </span>the intermediate days of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Festival, women may lamen</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">t</span> the demise of the deceased in unison, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but they may not clap </span>their hands in mourning? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yishmael says: Those that are</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> close to the bier may clap.

            "§ <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said: </span>It <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> obvious to me </span>that if one must choose between Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">service and reading the Megilla, reading the Megilla </span>takes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">precedence</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, based upon </span>the exposition of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina </span>with regard to the phrase “every family” (Esther 9:28). Similarly, if one must choose between <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Torah study and reading the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Megilla, reading the Megilla </span>takes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">precedence, based upon </span>the fact that the Sages of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the house of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">relied </span>on Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina’s exposition to rule that one interrupts Torah study to hear the reading of the Megilla.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it is taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> with regard to verses addressing the laws of a nazirite: “All the days that he consecrates himself to the Lord, he shall not come near to a dead body.

            "Having mentioned a teaching of Rabbi Abba in the name of Shmuel, the Gemara cites another of his statements: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Abba said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shmuel said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: From where </span>is it derived <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that one does not count</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> days to </span>make up <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">years, </span>i.e., a year is considered to be comprised of either twelve or thirteen lunar months, and not 365 days? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it is stated:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Of the months of the year</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Exodus 12:2), which indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you count months to </span>make up <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">years</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> but</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> you do not count days </span>to make up <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">years.</span>",

The Gemara explains the reason for this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with respect to each item mentioned in the mishna. The fast of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Ninth of Av </span>is not advanced because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does not advance calamity; </span>since the Ninth of Av is a tragic time, its observance is postponed as long as possible. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Festival </span>peace-offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and the </span>commandment of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">assembly [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">hakhel </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] </span>are not advanced <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because the time of their obligation </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">has not yet arrived, </span>and it is impossible to fulfill mitzvot before the designated time has arrived.

The Gemara attempts to clarify this statement: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Granted</span> that when the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> says that the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Festival </span>peace-offering is postponed, it means <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that if </span>a Festival <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">occurs on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Shabbat, </span>when the Festival peace-offering cannot be sacrificed, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> postpones it until after Shabbat </span>and sacrifices the offering on the intermediate days of the Festival. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, what is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The time </span>period <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of the Festival</span> peace-offering?

            "The Gemara adds: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Whose </span>opinion is reflected in the mishna according to Rav Oshaya’s explanation? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Shammai, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class=\"it-text\">Beitza</span> 19a) that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Shammai say: One may bring </span>peace-offerings <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on a Festival </span>day to be sacrificed in the Temple.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>burnt-offerings <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may not </span>be brought at all on the Festival.

Isn’t it written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the fortified cities were</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Ziddim-zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Joshua 19:35)<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and we maintain </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rakkath is Tiberias? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is the reason that he was uncertain: </span>Although Tiberias was surrounded by a wall in the time of Joshua, Hezekiah was uncertain about the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">due to </span>the fact <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one side, there was a wall of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sea, </span>i.e., there was no physical wall, but the city was protected due to the fact that it adjoined the sea. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, why was he uncertain? </span>The sea is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">certainly not a wall. As it is taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> with regard to the sale of houses in walled cities, the phrase: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Which has a wall</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Leviticus 25:30), indicates that the city has a bona fide wall <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>merely <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a wall of roofs</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> If a city is completely encircled by attached houses but there is no separate wall, it is not considered a walled city. The next verse, which is referring to cities that have no wall <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">round about </span>them” (Leviticus 25:31), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">excludes Tiberias </span>from being considered a walled city, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as the sea is its</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> wall </span>on one side and it is not fully encircled by a physical wall.

In this context, to be envious of sinners means to desire to be like them. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Dostai indicate that one is permitted to provoke the wicked, against the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak.", 
            "The Gemara explains: This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not difficult, </span>as it can be understood that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this, </span>Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement that one may not provoke the wicked, is referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to his </span>personal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matters, </span>while <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that, </span>the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Dostai that it is permitted to provoke them, is referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to matters of Heaven, </span>i.e., religious matters.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: However, if </span>that is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so, </span>i.e., that <span class=\"it-text\">vetaher</span> means that one is somewhat pure at the outset, then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with regard to a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, as it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And he shall wash his clothes, </span>and bathe his flesh in running water, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and he shall be clean [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">vetaher</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Leviticus 15:13), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there, what </span>sense <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of: And he shall </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be clean, at the outset is there </span>in that case?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span><span class=\"it-text\">vetaher</span> means that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he is now pure from</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> rendering earthenware vessels impure through movement</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> There is a <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> that a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> renders a vessel impure if he causes it to be moved, even though he did not come into direct contact with it, even if the opening of the vessel is smaller than a fingerbreadth. The verse teaches that once the <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> is purified through counting and immersion, he no longer renders vessels impure in that manner. The novelty here is that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even if he then experiences</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> another </span>emission, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he does not render </span>the vessels <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impure retroactively</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>This emission is unrelated to the previous emissions.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Here</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> too, </span>with regard to the leper, <span class=\"it-text\">vetaher</span> means that the quarantined leper <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is now pure from retroactively rendering </span>the contents of a house <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impure by </span>his <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">entrance </span>into the house. If someone with inconclusive symptoms of leprosy was quarantined and then declared ritually pure, and subsequently conclusive symptoms of leprosy developed, he is not considered to have been a leper from the time of the original quarantine, in which case the contents of any house he entered from that point would be rendered impure retroactively. Rather, once he was purified, he was absolutely pure. These subsequent conclusive symptoms are unrelated to the previous inconclusive symptoms. Therefore, the proof adduced by Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak is no proof.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, Rava said </span>that the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> that a quarantined leper is exempt from the obligation to let his hair grow and to rend his clothing is derived <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from here. </span>It is written: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the leper in whom [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">bo</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] the plague is, </span>his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall grow wild” (Leviticus 13:45), indicating that only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one whose </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">leprosy is dependent on </span>the state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his body, </span>in whom the plague is, is obligated to let his hair grow wild and to rend his garments.

            "§ The Gemara returns to the primary topic of this chapter, the book of Esther. The Gemara cites various aggadic interpretations of the verses of the Megilla. The opening verse of the Megilla states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And it came</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to pass [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">vayhi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] in the days of Ahasuerus” </span>(Esther 1:1). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Levi said, and some say </span>that it was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yonatan </span>who said: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This matter is a tradition </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we </span>received <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from the members of the Great Assembly. Anywhere</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that </span>the word <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">vayhi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is stated, it is </span>an ominous <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">term </span>indicating <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">nothing other </span>than impending <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">grief, </span>as if the word were a contraction of the words <span class=\"it-text\">vai</span> and <span class=\"it-text\">hi</span>, meaning woe and mourning.

            "Similarly, the verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it came to pass, when Samuel</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was old</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(I Samuel 8:1), and then it is written: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And his sons did not walk in his ways</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(I Samuel 8:3). Also, it states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it came</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to pass that David was successful in all his ways</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, and the Lord was with him</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(I Samuel 18:14), and only a few verses prior it is written: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Saul viewed David with suspicion</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(I Samuel 18:9).

            "After citing several verses where <span class=\"it-text\">vayhi</span> portends grief, the Gemara mentions a number of verses that seem to indicate otherwise. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">isn’t it written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it came to pass [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">vayhi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the eighth day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Leviticus 9:1), which was the day of the dedication of the Tabernacle? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> with regard to that day: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">On</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that day there was joy before the Holy One, Blessed</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be He, similar to </span>the joy that existed on the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day on which the heavens and earth were created. </span>The Gemara cites a verbal analogy in support of this statement. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is written here, </span>with regard to the dedication of the Tabernacle: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it came to pass [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">vayhi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the eighth day,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it is written there, </span>in the Creation story: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it was [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">vayhi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] </span>evening, and it was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">morning, one day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Genesis 1:5).

Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani interpreted the verse homiletically as referring to the righteous individuals who superseded the wicked ones in the book of Esther. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “Instead of the thorn”; </span>this means <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">instead of the wicked Haman. </span>He is referred to as a thorn <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because he turned himself into an</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> object of idol worship, </span>as he decreed that all must prostrate themselves before him.

            "After mentioning three kings who ruled over the world, the Gemara presents <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> mnemonic </span>for the names of other kings that will be discussed below: <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Shin</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>Solomon, i.e., Shlomo; <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">samekh</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>Sennacherib; <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">dalet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> Darius; <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">kaf</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>Cyrus, i.e., Koresh.

            "The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is </span>this calculation? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it is written </span>with regard to Jeremiah’s prophecy of a return to Eretz Yisrael: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">After seventy years</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> are accomplished for Babylonia I will remember you </span>and perform My good word toward you, enabling you to return to this place” (Jeremiah 29:10), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>elsewhere <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written </span>in a slightly different formulation: “In the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, meditated in the books, over the number of the years, which the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that He would accomplish for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the desolations of Jerusalem seventy years</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Daniel 9:2). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He, </span>Belshazzar, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">calculated </span>as follows: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Forty-five </span>years <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Nebuchadnezzar, and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">twenty-three of Evil-merodach, and two of his </span>own, for a total of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">seventy </span>years that had passed without redemption. He was therefore certain that Jeremiah’s prophecy would no longer be fulfilled, and he therefore said: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">I will </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">take out the vessels of the Holy Temple and use </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">them.</span>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From where do we </span>derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that Nebuchadnezzar reigned </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for forty-five years? As the Master said: They were </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">exiled in the seventh </span>year; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they were exiled in </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the eighth </span>year; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they were exiled in the eighteenth </span>year; and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they were exiled in the nineteenth </span>year. ", 
            "The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They were exiled in the seventh</span> year <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after </span>Nebuchadnezzar’s <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">subjugation of Jehoiakim, </span>in what was known as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the exile of Jehoiachin, which was </span>actually <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> eighth </span>year <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Nebuchadnezzar’s </span>reign.

            "The Gemara calculates: Since Evil-merodach acted in the first year of his reign, immediately after coming to power, it turns out that Nebuchadnezzar ruled for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eight </span>years before he sent Jehoiachin into exile, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and thirty-seven </span>years during which Jehoiachin was in prison. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This </span>equals <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">forty-five </span>years of the reign <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Nebuchadnezzar.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said </span>in response: The seventy years that “are accomplished for Babylonia” were <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">only for</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> being remembered [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">lifekida</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">], </span>as mentioned in the verse, allowing the Jews to return to Eretz Yisrael but not to build the Temple. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And this is as it is written </span>with regard to Cyrus’s proclamation permitting the Jewish people’s return to Eretz Yisrael, in the seventieth year of the Babylonian exile: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Lord, God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of the earth; and He has charged </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">[</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">pakad</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] me to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">build Him a house in Jerusalem</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Ezra 1:2).

            "The Gemara understands that all the names referred to in the verse as children of Pharaoh’s daughter refer to Moses, as it will soon explain.

Because manna came</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> down [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">yarad</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] for the Jewish people in his days. </span>He was also called <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Gedor</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because he fenced in [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">gadar</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] the breaches of the Jewish people. </span>He was called <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Heber</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because he connected [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥibber</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] the Jewish people </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to their Father in Heaven. </span>He was called <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Soco</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> he was for the Jewish people like a shelter [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">sukka</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] </span>and shield.

            "The Gemara notes that the words “father of” appear three times in that same verse: “And his wife Hajehudijah bore Jered the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">father</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of </span>Gedor, and Heber the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">father of </span>Soco, and Jekuthiel the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">father of </span>Zanoah.” This teaches that Moses was a father to all of the Jewish people in three respects: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A father in Torah, a father in wisdom, </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> father in prophecy.</span>",

            "Nabal, your husband, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is a rebel against the throne</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> as David had already been anointed as king by the prophet Samuel, and Nabal refused his orders. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is no need to try him, </span>as a rebel is not accorded the ordinary prescriptions governing judicial proceedings.

Abigail came to David in order to save her husband Nabal, but at the same time she indicates that if her husband dies, David should remember her and marry her. And indeed, after Nabal’s death David took Abigail for his wife. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Some say </span>that Rav Naḥman referred to a different saying: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The goose stoops </span>its head <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it goes</span> along, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but its eyes look on from afar </span>to find what it is looking for.

The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a conclusive</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> refutation.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Malachi is </span>in fact <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ezra. And the Rabbis say </span>otherwise: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Malachi was his </span>real <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">name, </span>and it was not merely another name for Ezra or another prophet. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Naḥman said: </span>It <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">stands to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">reason </span>that indeed, they are one and the same person, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">like </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the one who said that Malachi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is Ezra, </span>since there is a similarity between them, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is stated in Malachi’s prophecy:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Judah has dealt </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">treacherously, and a disgusting thing has been done in Israel </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctity of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Lord which he loved, and has married the daughter </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of a strange god</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Malachi 2:11).

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And who </span>was the one that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">removed the foreign women </span>who were married to Jews?

It therefore appears that Malachi was one of Ezra’s names, as the Bible describes them both as confronting an intermarriage epidemic.", 
            "To complete the discussion about the prophetesses, the Gemara cites a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> in which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Sages taught: There were four women of extraordinary beaut</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">y</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in the world: Sarah, and Abigail, Rahab, and Esther. And</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> according to the one who said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Esther was greenish</span> in color, lacking natural beauty, only that a cord of divine grace was strung around her, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">remove Esther </span>from the list <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and insert Vashti </span>in her place, for she was indeed beautiful.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rahab aroused impure thoughts by her name</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> i.e., the mere mention of her name would inspire lust for her; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yael, by her voice; Abigail, by remembering </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">her; Michal, the daughter of Saul, by her appearance. </span>Similarly, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who says Rahab, Rahab, immediately experiences </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a seminal emission </span>due to the arousal of desire caused by Rahab’s great beauty. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Naḥman said to him: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">I say: Rahab, Rahab, and it does not affect me.</span> Rabbi Yitzchak <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When I said </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this, </span>I was specifically referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to one who knows her </span>personally <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and recognizes her </span>beauty.

            "§ The Gemara returns to its explanation of the verses of the book of Esther. The verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When Mordecai perceived all that was</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> done</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and bitter cry” (Esther 4:1). The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What did </span>Mordecai <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>when he cried out? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav said: </span>He said that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Haman has </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">risen above Ahasuerus, </span>for he saw that Haman had become even stronger than Ahasuerus himself, and that he controlled all affairs of the empire. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Shmuel said: The upper King</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> has prevailed over the lower king, </span>saying this euphemistically and insinuating just the opposite. In other words, it would appear that Ahasuerus, the lower king, has prevailed over the higher King, God in Heaven, Who desires good for the Jewish people.", 
            "The verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Then the queen was exceedingly distressed</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">[</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">vatitḥal</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] </span>(Esther 4:4). The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is </span>the meaning of <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">vatitḥalḥal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">? Rav said: </span>This means <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> she began to menstruat</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span> out of fear, as the cavities, <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalalim</span>, of her body opened. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Her bowels were loosened, </span>also understanding the verse as referring to her bodily cavities.", 
            "The verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Then Esther called for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Hathach, </span>one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her” (Esther 4:5). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: Hathach is </span>in fact the prophet <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Daniel</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">why was he called Hathach? Because he was cut down [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥatakh</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] from his greatness </span>during Ahasuerus’s reign, as he was demoted from his high position. Previously he had served as a senior minister, and now he had become Esther’s steward. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Shmuel </span>expounded the name Hathach as derived from <span class=\"it-text\">ḥatakh</span> in the opposite sense, as he <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: </span>Daniel was called Hathach <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because all the affairs of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">kingdom were decided [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">neḥtakhin</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] by his word.</span>",

The Gemara explains that when Ahasuerus said to Haman: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And do so to Mordecai,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>Haman <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him </span>in an attempt to evade the order: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Who is Mordecai? </span>Ahasuerus <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Jew.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>Haman then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> him: There are several </span>men named <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Mordecai among the Jews</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>Ahasuerus then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: </span>I refer to the one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who sits at the king’s gate.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>",

Go away from him so that you </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">should not get burnt from his coals, </span>i.e., that you should not suffer harm as well. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">At that moment </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Mordecai wrapped himself </span>in his prayer shawl <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and stood up </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to pray.

The Gemara proves its assertion about Shmuel: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class=\"it-text\">Yevamot</span> 41a) with regard to a different matter, the case of a widow whose husband died childless and who was waiting for one of his surviving brothers to perform the required levirate marriage with her or, alternatively, to release her with the <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalitza</span> ceremony: In a case where <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a woman </span>was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">waiting for her brother-in-la</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">w</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and </span>in the meantime one of her deceased husband’s <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">brothers betrothed </span>this woman’s <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sister</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> they said in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira: We say to</span> this brother: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Wait </span>before marrying your betrothed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">until your older</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> brother acts, </span>performing the levirate marriage or <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalitza</span>.", 
            "The reason for this is that before levirate marriage or <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalitza</span> is performed, all the brothers are considered, by rabbinic decree, to have a quasi-marital connection with the widow. Consequently, just as one may not marry his wife’s sister, he may not marry the sister of a woman who is waiting for him to perform levirate marriage. The Sages, however, disagree with Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and maintain that only the oldest of the brothers is considered bound to the widow, as he is the primary candidate to perform these acts. Consequently, the widow has no connection at all with the other brothers. And <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shmuel </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: The </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">halakha</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira. </span>This demonstrates that Shmuel takes into consideration the opinion of a single Sage against the majority when that minority opinion is more stringent than the majority opinion.

This </span>second <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, which says that a Megilla with blurred or torn letters is unfit, is referring to a case where this is so throughout <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the whole of </span>the Megilla; whereas <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>first <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, which says that a Megilla is fit even if whole verses are missing, is referring to a case where the missing material is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">part </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of it.</span>",

            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>this is a case in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which a </span>complete <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Megilla is lying before </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">him </span>and he is copying from it, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and he was </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">reading from </span>that complete Megilla <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">verse by verse and </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">writing </span>each verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>his new copy.

            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is </span>nevertheless <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">necessary </span>to mention separately the case of a woman who observes a day for a day. As, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it might enter your mind to say that </span>this woman’s bleeding <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">should be treated like the first emission </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like secretion, in that just as a man attains the status of a full-fledged <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> once he has three such emissions, so too, a woman attains the status of a full-fledged <span class=\"it-text\">zava</span> once she experiences three days of bleeding. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the first emission of a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is likened to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> one who experienced a seminal discharge, as it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">halakha</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of him that has an </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">issue and of him whose semen goes from him</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Leviticus 15:32). From this it is learned: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Just as one who</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> experienced a seminal discharge immerses on the </span>same <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day </span>that he had the discharge, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so too, that one, </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may immerse himself on the </span>same <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day </span>that he had the emission.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>although <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this one, </span>i.e., a woman who observes a day for a day, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">cannot immerse on the</span> same <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day </span>that she experienced the bleeding, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> written:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">All the days of her issue shall be to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> her as the bed of her menstruation</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Leviticus 15:26), which teaches that she remains the entire day of her issue in her impure state and must wait until the day is over before she can immerse herself, nevertheless, one might have said that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at least during the night </span>following the day of her issue <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">she should </span>be able to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">perform a partial observation, </span>i.e., she should verify that part of the night has gone by without bleeding, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immerse herself </span>at night, without waiting until morning. Therefore, the mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches us </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since she is required to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">count </span>one day of purity after her day of impurity, "

        [

            "§ The mishna concludes: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all these</span> things, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if one did them after daybreak they are valid</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From where is this matter </span>derived, that from daybreak it is already considered daytime? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As the verse states:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And God called the light </span>[or] <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Genesis 1:5), meaning: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">To that which was becoming</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> lighter and lighter he called day. </span>The Hebrew word <span class=\"it-text\">or</span> is not to be understood in its usual sense of light, but as a verbal noun: that which is becoming lighter and lighter. It teaches that as soon as light begins to appear in the sky it is called daytime. ", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with this interpretation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, if </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so </span>that Rava’s interpretation of this phrase is correct, the following phrase: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the darkness</span> [<span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥoshekh</span>] <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He called night</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Genesis 1:5), should be interpreted in a similar fashion: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">That which was becoming darker </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and darker He called night, </span>so that immediately after sunset it would be considered nighttime.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, Rabbi Zeira </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: </span>We derive this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from here, </span>as it is stated: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">So we labored in the work; and half</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of them held the spears from the rising of the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> morning till the stars appeared</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Nehemiah 4:15), where “rising of the morning” means daybreak, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>the next verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">states:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">So that in the night they may be a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guard to us; </span>and labor in the day” (Nehemiah 4:16). This demonstrates that the day begins with the dawn.", 
            "The Gemara clarifies Rabbi Zeira’s statement: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What </span>need is there for the additional verse introduced by the words <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it states”? </span>Why does the first proof-text not suffice? The Gemara explains: The second verse comes to deflect the following possible objection: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">You might say that </span>even <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the rising of the morning</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is not </span>yet considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day, and that from </span>the time <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when the sun sets</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it is </span>already considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">night, and </span>in this particular incident it happened that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they began </span>their work <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">early, </span>before the official beginning of daytime, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and remained </span>working <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">late, </span>after the official end of daytime.

            "The Gemara answers: In fact, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shmuel </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was also subordinate to Rav, </span>as Rav was indeed the leading authority in Babylonia, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it was Rav who showed </span>Shmuel <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">honor </span>of his own volition, in order to appease him for having cursed him. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And he did this </span>only when Shmuel was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in his presence, </span>but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when he was </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not in his presence, </span>Rav <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did not do this, </span>and therefore Rav would read first from the Torah when Shmuel was not present.", 
            "The Gemara comments: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">So too, it is reasonable </span>to assume that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav read </span>first <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the portion that is generally designated for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">priests,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> because if it enters your mind to say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> read </span>third, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the portion designated for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an </span>ordinary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Israelite</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, what is the reason he recited a blessing before </span>reading his portion? Only the first reader recites a blessing before reading from the Torah.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, he should also have recited a blessing after</span> his reading, as the rabbinic enactment requires those who read from the Torah to recite blessings both before and after their reading. The Gemara answers: The reason that the Sages required all the readers to recite blessings both before and after their readings was to prevent misunderstandings on the part of both those who enter the synagogue in the middle of the reading and those who leave early. But <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was different where Rav was present, as </span>people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">would enter</span> the synagogue in the middle of the reading, "

However</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>in the case of one who recites: Just as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Your</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> mercy is extended to a bird’s nest, what is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the reason </span>that they silence him?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Two </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">amora’im</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disagree </span>about <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>question, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei bar Avin and Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yosei bar Zevida.

            "The Gemara relates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a particular </span>individual <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">descended </span>before the ark as prayer leader <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the presence of Rabba</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said </span>in his prayers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">You have shown mercy</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to birds, </span>as expressed through the mitzva to chase away the mother bird before taking eggs from its <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">nest; </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">have mercy and pity upon us. You have shown mercy </span>to animals, as expressed through the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and its offspring </span>on the same day; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">have mercy </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and pity upon us. Rabba said: How much does this </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">rabbi know to appease </span>the Lord, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his Master! Abay</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to him: Didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they silence him?</span>", 
            "The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabba, </span>too, held in accordance with this mishna but merely acted this way because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he wanted to hone Abaye’s </span>intellect. Rabba did not make his statement to praise the rabbi, but simply to test his nephew and student, Abaye, and to encourage him to articulate what he knows about the mishna.", 
            "With regard to additions to prayers formulated by the Sages, the Gemara relates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> particular </span>individual <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">descended </span>before the ark as prayer leader <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the presence of Rabbi Ḥanina. </span>He extended his prayer and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome, the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> powerful, and the strong, and the fearless. </span>", 
            "When he finished, Rabbi Ḥanina <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: Have you concluded </span>all of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the praises of your Master? Even these three </span>praises <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that we recite: </span>The great, the mighty, and the awesome, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">had Moses our teacher not written them in the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Torah </span>(Deuteronomy 10:17), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and had the members of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Great Assembly not come and incorporated them </span>into the <span class=\"it-text\">Amida</span> prayer (see Nehemiah 9:32), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we would not </span>be permitted to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">recite them. And you went on and recited all of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these. It is comparable to a man who possessed many </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">thousands of golden dinars, yet they were praising him for </span>owning <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a thousand silver </span>ones. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Isn’t that deprecatory toward </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">him? </span>All of the praises one can lavish upon the Lord are nothing but a few silver dinars relative to many thousands of gold dinars. Reciting a litany of praise does not enhance God’s honor.", 
            "Tangentially, the Gemara cites an additional statement by Rabbi Ḥanina, concerning principles of faith. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Ḥanina said: Everything is in the hands of Heaven</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, except for fear of Heaven</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> Man has free will to serve God or not, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is stated:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> now, Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> you other than to fear </span>the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 10:12). The fact that God asks man to fear Him indicates that it is in man’s ability to do so.", 
            "The Gemara notes: This proves <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by inference that fear </span>of Heaven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is a minor</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> matter, </span>as the verse is formulated as though God is not asking anything significant. Can it in fact be maintained that fear of Heaven is a minor matter? The Gemara responds: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Indeed, for Moses our teacher, </span>fear of Heaven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a minor matter. It is comparable to one who is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> asked for a large vessel and he has </span>one; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> seems to him like a small vessel </span>because he owns it. However, one who is asked for just <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a small</span> vessel and he does not have one, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it seems to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> him like a large vessel. </span>Therefore, Moses could say: What does the Lord your God ask of you other than to fear, because in his eyes it was a minor matter.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Zeira said: One who </span>repeats himself while reciting <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span> and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">says: Listen </span>Israel, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">listen </span>Israel, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is like one who says: We give thanks, we give</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> thanks.</span>", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection: </span>It was taught in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">One who recites </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Shema</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and repeats it, it is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> reprehensible. </span>One may infer: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is reprehensible, </span>but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they do</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not silence him. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This </span>is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">difficult. This </span>case, where one repeats <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span> and it is reprehensible but they do not silence him, is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one who recites and repeats each individual word. </span>In so doing, he ruins the recitation of <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>. However, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>case, where Rabbi Zeira holds that they silence one who repeats <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span>, is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one who recites and repeats an</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> entire verse, </span>as it appears that he is worshipping separate authorities.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Pappa said to Rava</span> with regard to this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And perhaps initially he did</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not focus his attention </span>on the recitation of <span class=\"it-text\">Shema</span> and therefore had to repeat it, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and now he focused his</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> attention. </span>Rava <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: Can one have </span>that degree of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">familiarity with Heaven, </span>to the extent that he can take his words lightly and say them however he likes? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If he did not focus his attention, we beat </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">him with a blacksmith’s hammer until he focuses his </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">attention, </span>as conduct of that sort is unacceptable.", 
            "We learned in the mishna: If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one modifies </span>the text while reading the laws of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">forbidden sexual relations, they silence him. Rav </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yosef taught </span>that this is referring to one who says: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The shame of his father and the shame of his</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> mother</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> instead of: “The nakedness of your father and the nakedness of your mother you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:7).",

While she herself did not suffer, the curse was apparently fulfilled in the blindness of her son, Isaac.", 
            "According to Rabbi Yitzḥak, Abimelech’s curse was the cause of Isaac’s blindness, and it was not, as Rabbi Elazar suggested, the fact he gazed at Esau. The Gemara explains: Both <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that </span>jointly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">caused it. Rava said: </span>The prohibition against gazing at the likeness of a wicked person is derived <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> here:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is not good to raise the face</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of the wicked</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Proverbs 18:5).",

As such, they will never achieve greatness in Torah, and it will be as if they just tended cattle throughout their lives.
