            "[Mishnah] ON THE EVENING [אור].  OF THE FOURTEENTH [OF NISAN]  A SEARCH IS MADE FOR LEAVENBY THE LIGHT OF A LAMP. ", 
            "EVERY PLACE WHEREIN LEAVENED BREAD IS NOT TAKEN DOES NOT REQUIRE SEARCHING, THEN IN WHAT CASE DID THEY RULE, TWO ROWS OF THE WINE CELLAR [MUST BE SEARCHED]?[CONCERNING] A PLACE WHEREIN LEAVEN MIGHT BE TAKEN, BETH SHAMMAI MAINTAIN: TWO ROWS OVER THE FRONT OF THE WHOLE CELLAR; BUT BETH HILLEL MAINTAIN: THE TWO OUTER ROWS, WHICH ARE THE UPPERMOST.

            "[Gemara] What is OR? ", 
            "— R. Huna said: ", 
            "Light [נגהי]; while Rab Judah said: ", 
            "Night [לילי]. ", 
            "Now it was assumed [that] he who says light means literally light;(I.e., daybreak or morning.) while he who says night means literally night. ", 
            "An objection is raised: ", 
            "As soon as the morning was light [or], the men were sent away,(Gen. XLIV, 3.) ", 
            "which proves that ‘or’ is day? ", 
            "— Is it then written, The ‘or’ was morning: ", 
            "[Surely] ‘the morning was or’ is written, as one says, ", 
            "Morning has broken forth. ", 
            "And [this verse is] in accordance with what Rab Judah said in Rab's name. For Rab Judah said in Rab's name: ", 
            "A man should always enter [a town] by day, and set out by day.  ", 
            "An objection is raised: As the light of [or] the morning, when the sun riseth,(II Sam. XXIII, 4.) ", 
            "which proves that ‘or’ means the daytime? ", 
            "— Is it then written, ‘or is morning’: ", 
            "surely it is written, ", 
            "‘as the light of [or] the morning’, and this is its meaning: ‘and as the light of the morning’ in this world so shall the rising of the sun be unto the righteous in the world to come.", 
            " An objection is raised: ", 
            "And God called the light [or] Day(Gen. I, 5.) which proves that or is daytime? ", 
            "— This is its meaning: ", 
            "the advancing of light He called Day.  ", 
            "If so, ‘and the darkness He called Night’ means [similarly], the advancing of darkness He called Night: ", 
            "but surely it is an established principle that it is day until the appearance of the stars? ", 
            "Rather this is its meaning: ", 
            "The Merciful One summoned the light ", 
            "and appointed it for duty by day, and He summoned the darkness and appointed it for duty by night.  ", 
            "An objection is raised: ", 
            "Praise him all ye stars of light [or],(Ps. CXLVIII, 3.) which proves that ‘or’ is evening? ", 
            "— This is its meaning: ", 
            "praise him all ye stars which give light. ", 
            "If so, are only the stars that give light to praise [Him], while those which do not give light need not praise ", 
            "— yet surely It is written, Praise ye him, all his host?(Ibid. 2.) ", 
            "Rather he [the Psalmist] tells us this: ", 
            "the light of the stars too is [designated] light. ", 
            "What is its practical bearing? In respect of one who vows [not to benefit] from light. (For it was taught:) ", 
            "If one vows [not to benefit] from light, he is prohibited the light of stars. ", 
            "An objection is raised: ", 
            "The murderer riseth with the light [or], he killeth the poor and needy, and in the night he is as a thief.(Job. XXIV, 14.)"
