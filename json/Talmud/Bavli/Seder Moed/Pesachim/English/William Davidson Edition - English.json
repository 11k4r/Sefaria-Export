Any place </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">into which one does not </span>typically <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">take leavened bread does </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not require a search, </span>as it is unlikely that there is any leavened bread there. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And with regard to what </span>the Sages of previous generations meant when they <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said </span>that one must search <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two rows </span>of wine barrels <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">cellar, </span>i.e., <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a place into which one </span>typically <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">takes </span>some <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">leavened bread, </span>the early <span class=\"it-text\">tanna’im</span> are in dispute. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Shammai say </span>that this is referring to searching the first <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two rows across the entire cellar, and Beit Hillel </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say: </span>There is no need to search that extensively, as it is sufficient to search <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the two external rows, which </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are the upper ones. </span>This dispute will be explained and illustrated in the Gemara.", 
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is </span>the meaning of the term <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>translated as: The evening of? The Gemara provides two answers. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Huna said: </span>It means <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">light, and Rav Yehuda </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: </span>In this context, it means <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">evening. </span>At first glance, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it </span>could <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">enter your mind </span>to suggest that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the one </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who said light </span>means that one searches for leaven by the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">actual light </span>of day, on the morning of the fourteenth of Nisan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and the one who said evening </span>is referring to the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">actual evening </span>of the fourteenth.", 
            "To clarify the meaning of the word <span class=\"it-text\">or</span>, the Gemara analyzes biblical verses and rabbinic statements. The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection </span>from a verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“As soon as the morning was </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> men were sent away, </span>they and their donkeys” (Genesis 44:3). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently, </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is day. </span>The Gemara rejects this contention. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Is it written: The light was morning? “The morning was</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> light” is written. </span>In this context, <span class=\"it-text\">or</span> is a verb not a noun, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as the one who said: </span>The <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">morning</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> lightened. And </span>this is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>that which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Yehuda said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav said, as Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav said: A person </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">always enter </span>an unfamiliar city <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with “it is good” </span>(Genesis 1:4), i.e., before sunset, while it is light, as the Torah uses the expression “it is good” with regard to light upon its creation. This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>likewise, when one leaves a city <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">leave with “it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">good,” </span>meaning after sunrise the next morning.", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection </span>from another verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> as the light [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] of the morning, when the sun</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> rises, </span>a morning without clouds; when through clear shining after rain the tender grass springs out of the earth” (II Samuel 23:4). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently, </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is day. </span>The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Is it written </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the light</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was morning? “As the light of the morning” is written</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, and this is </span>what the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is saying: And as</span> brightly as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the morning light of this world </span>shines at its peak, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so will be the rising of the sun</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for the righteou</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in the World-to-Come, </span>as in those days the light of the sun will be seven times stronger than at present (see Isaiah 30:26).", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection: “And God called the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Day, </span>and the darkness He called Night” (Genesis 1:5). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently,</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is day. </span>The Gemara rejects this proof as well. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is </span>what the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is saying: </span>God <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">called</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the advancing light Day. </span>As stated previously, the word <span class=\"it-text\">or</span> can also be a verb; in this context, God called the beginning of that which eventually brightens, Day. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, if </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is so, </span>the continuation of the verse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“and the darkness He called Night</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,” </span>should be understood to mean: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He called the advancing darkness</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Night, </span>even before it is actually dark. However, this cannot be the correct interpretation of the verse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as we maintain</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it is day until the emergence of the stars. </span>Since the stars emerge only after the sky begins to darken, the advancing evening cannot be defined as part of the night.", 
            "The Gemara rejects the previous explanation. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, this</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is what </span>the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is saying: God called the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">light </span>to come <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and commanded it </span>to perform <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the mitzva </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of the day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and God called the night and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">commanded it </span>to perform <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the mitzva of the night. </span>Called, in this context, does not connote the giving of a name. It means that He instructed the day and night to carry out their characteristic functions.", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection: </span>“Praise Him, sun and moon; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">praise </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Him, all the stars of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Psalms 148:3). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently, </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">evening, </span>as the stars of light appear at night. The Gemara rejects this contention. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is </span>what the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is saying: Praise Him, all the stars that </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">radiate, </span>as in this context <span class=\"it-text\">or</span> is not a noun but rather a verb that describes the activity of the stars. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, if </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so, </span>does the verse mean that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">stars </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that radiate that are required to praise </span>God, whereas those <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that do not radiat</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span> light<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> are not required to praise </span>Him? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But isn’t it written </span>in the previous verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Praise Him, all His legions,” </span>indicating that all stars should praise God?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, this</span> phrase, the stars of light, comes to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teach us</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that the light of stars is also </span>considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">light. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What </span>is the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">practical difference </span>that emerges from the fact that the light of the stars is classified as light? The Gemara answers: It is significant with regard <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to one who vows </span>that he will derive no benefit <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from light. </span>It is necessary to define precisely what is included in the term light. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As we learned </span>in a mishna: For <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one who vows </span>that he will derive no benefit <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from light</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it is prohibited to </span>benefit even from <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the light of </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">stars.</span>", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “A murderer rises with the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to kill the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">poor and needy; and in the night he is as </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a thief” </span>(Job 24:14).

        [
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From </span>the fact <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>the end of the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">states: “And in the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">night he is as a thief,” apparently </span>the word <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span> at the beginning of the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>a reference to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day, </span>as the verse contrasts between night and <span class=\"it-text\">or</span>. The Gemara rejects this contention. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">There, this is </span>what the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is saying: If </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matter is as clear to you </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as light, that </span>the thief has <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">come </span>into the house prepared to take <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a life, </span>he <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is a murderer; and </span>the owner of the house <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may save himself by </span>taking the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">life </span>of the intruder. In that case, one may protect himself from a thief who breaks into his house, even by killing the intruder if necessary. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> matter is as unclear to you as the night, he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> should be </span>nothing more <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">than a thief in your eyes</span> and not a murderer; and therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one may not save</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> himself by </span>taking the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">life </span>of the thief. This verse is not referring to actual day and night; rather, it uses these terms as metaphors for certainty and uncertainty.", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection </span>to the opinion that <span class=\"it-text\">or</span> means evening: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Let the stars of the twilight be</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> dark; let it look for </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> but have none; neither</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> let it see the eyelids of the morning” </span>(Job 3:9). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From </span>the fact <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">states: “Let it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">look for </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> but have none,” apparently </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is day. </span>The Gemara rejects this contention. Actually, it is possible that <span class=\"it-text\">or</span>, in this context, means light in general, not specifically day. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">There, Job is cursing his fortune. He said: Let </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it be </span>His <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">will that this man, </span>referring to himself, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">will seek light and not find it.</span>", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection: “And I say, yet the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> darkness shall envelop me, and the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> about me shall</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be night” </span>(Psalms 139:11). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently, </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is day. </span>The Gemara rejects this proof. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is </span>what <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">David is saying </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there: I said </span>after I sinned that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">darkness shall envelop </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">me in the World-to-Come, which is like day. </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Now </span>that I know that I have been forgiven, even <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this world, which is like darkness, </span>is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">light for me. </span>That being the case, it cannot be derived from here that the word <span class=\"it-text\">or</span> describes the day.", 
            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection </span>from a mishna. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> says: One searches </span>on <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of the fourteenth </span>of Nisan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the fourteenth </span>in the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">morning, and at the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time of </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">removal </span>of leavened bread.

            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection </span>from a different source: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From when </span>on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the fourteenth </span>of Nisan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prohibited to perform labor, </span>for those who are accustomed not to work of Passover eve? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: From the time of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda says: From sunrise.</span>",

The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Merciful One states the time of </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter </span>of the Paschal lamb, which begins at the end of the sixth hour.

When the end of the fig season arrives, and those <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">remaining figs </span>on the trees are few and of inferior quality, there is room to assume that the owner has renounced his ownership over them. However, he continues to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guard his field due to the grapes, </span>which are harvested at that time. Similarly, when the end of the grape season arrives, those few <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">remaining grape</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span> are of inferior quality and the owner <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guards his field due</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to the cucumbers and due to the gourds, </span>which have not yet been harvested.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When the owner is particular about </span>the figs and the grapes respectively, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is prohibited </span>to take them, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">due to </span>the prohibition against <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">robbery, and </span>one with permission to eat them is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obligated due to </span>the mitzva to separate the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tithe </span>from them, as they are considered like any other fruit. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When the owner is not particular about </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">them, </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted </span>to eat them <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">due to </span>the fact that the prohibition against <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">robbery </span>does not apply, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and</span> one who eats them is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">exempt due to </span>the fact that the obligation to separate the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tithe </span>does not apply, as they are ownerless property. This indicates that if one is not particular about an object, even if it is located in property that he is guarding for another purpose, that object is not thereby rendered significant. The same reasoning applies to breadcrumbs that remain in one’s house.",

            "The Gemara returns to the issue of the nullification of leaven.

The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since </span>there is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a rabbinic prohibition </span>that takes effect <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on </span>the leaven, as it is prohibited to derive benefit from it after the fifth hour, its legal status <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is like </span>that of leaven prohibited <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by Torah law, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is not in his possession and he </span>is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">unable to nullify </span>it.", 
            "The Gemara continues: There is proof that the Sages were stringent with regard to leaven prohibited by rabbinic law, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a man who betroths </span>a woman on the fourteenth of Nisan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the beginning of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the sixth hour </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and onward</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> even </span>if he does so <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with wheat </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from the mountains [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">kurdanaita</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> which is particularly hard and there is no certainty that it will ferment even if water falls on it, nevertheless, as it is possible that the wheat leavened, its legal status is that of leaven.

Therefore, if a man gives the wheat to a woman for the purpose of betrothal, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>need <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">concerned that </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a betrothal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> The reason is that a betrothal is effective only if the man gives the woman an object worth at least a <span class=\"it-text\">peruta</span>. In this case the Sages disqualify the betrothal and allow the woman to marry another man, despite the fact that by Torah law she is betrothed to the first man, as the leaven with which he betrothed her is prohibited only by rabbinic law.", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>is it indeed the case that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after the </span>leaven has become <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prohibited </span>one is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">unable to render it null and void?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: Here we are dealing with a student sitting before</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> his teacher, and he remembers that there is kneaded dough</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in his house</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and he is afraid lest it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> leaven </span>before he can return home to warn the members of his household.

However, if it had already become leavened, rendering it null and void will not remedy the situation even if he were home. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">learn from this </span>proof that Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov’s interpretation is correct.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba bar Rav Huna said</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav said: </span>With regard to a vessel that contains several loaves in which there was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bread that became moldy</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> and it is not evident whether it is leaven or <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">once there was more </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span> than leaven in the vessel, it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted. </span>The Gemara first analyzes the case itself: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What are the circumstances? If you say that</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> he knows that </span>this loaf <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is leavened bread, </span>even if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there were more </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, what of </span>it? What difference does it make that most of the food is <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, if it is clear that this loaf is leaven?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>Rav must be speaking of a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where we </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do not know whether it is leavened bread </span>or <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">whether </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>However, in that case, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">why </span>discuss <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">specifically</span> a situation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where there was more </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span> in the vessel? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Even </span>in a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where there was not more </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span> in the vessel <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as well, </span>the questionable loaf is likely to be <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">let us follow the last</span> item placed in the vessel, which even on the first day of Passover would be <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">coins that were found before animal merchants </span>in Jerusalem, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they are always </span>assumed to be money of the second <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tithe</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> as most of the animals purchased in Jerusalem were bought with that money. This <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> applies both during a Festival and throughout the year, as people would purchase animals for meat with their second-tithe money, and it can therefore be assumed that these coins have the status of second tithe. However, if the money was found <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the Temple Mount </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">non-sacred </span>money, even during a Festival. It can be assumed that one who enters the Temple Mount has already purchased all the animals that he required beforehand. Any coins in his possession are non-sacred money, not tithes.", 
            "If the money was found elsewhere <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in Jerusalem during the Festival, </span>when many people came to Jerusalem with their second-tithe money, the coins are presumed to be second-<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tithe </span>money. However, if the coins were found <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">during the rest of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">year, </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">non-sacred </span>money.", 
            "The Gemara explains the proof. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rav </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shemaya bar Zeira said: What is the reason </span>that during the rest of the year the coins are considered non-sacred money, even on the day after the Festival? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the markets of Jerusalem tend to be cleaned every day, </span>any money left there would already have been found by the street cleaners. Consequently, any coins found there were left there recently. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently, we say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the first ones are</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> gone and these </span>objects <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are later ones. Here too, </span>with regard to moldy bread, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">let us say: The first ones</span> have been eaten and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are gone, and this </span>food <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from now </span>and is undoubtedly <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">different</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> here, as the mold proves about </span>the loaf that it is leaven, as food does not become moldy unless it has been sitting for a long time. The Gemara retorts: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If its mold proves about </span>the loaf that it is leaven, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if there was more </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span> in the vessel, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of </span>it?

In other words, several days of the Festival, during which <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> is consumed, have passed. Therefore, it is more likely that the moldy loaf is <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obvious </span>that the moldy loaf is <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, not leaven. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">No, it is necessary</span> to teach this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to a situation where <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its mold is extensive. Lest you say: Since its mold</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is extensive the matter is revealed that it is certainly</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> leavened bread, </span>therefore Rav <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches us </span>that one cannot be entirely sure that this is the case.", 
            "The Gemara explains the reason for the uncertainty. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since several days of </span>eating <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> have</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> passed over </span>the vessel, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we say: Each and every </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day he baked warm loaves, which he placed upon </span>the previous days’ <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, causing <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it to grow moldier. </span>Therefore, it is possible that even though only a brief time has passed, the <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> has grown very moldy, due to the moisture and heat inside the vessel.",

The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is different there, as at the time when he lifts</span> the <span class=\"it-text\">lulav</span> before he recites the blessing, he already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfilled</span> his obligation by Torah law.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The reason </span>that one need not search again <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is that we did not see </span>the marten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">drag </span>the leaven from the house; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">however, if</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> we saw </span>the marten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">drag </span>leaven from the house, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we</span> are indeed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">concerned </span>that it dragged the leaven into the second house, and it therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">requires searching </span>for leaven.", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> why </span>is this so? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let us say </span>that the marten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ate </span>the bread it took. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The residences of gentile</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> are ritually impure</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>as their wives may have miscarried, and due to the fact that gentiles would bury their stillborn babies in their houses, all their residences are deemed ritually impure due to the possibility of impurity imparted by a corpse. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And how</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> long </span>must a gentile have <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">stayed in a residence </span>for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the residence to require searching? </span>He must have lived there for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">forty days. </span>The reason is that until forty days after conception the miscarried fetus is not classified as a stillborn, as it is not sufficiently developed before that stage.",

In light of this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> it is possible that the fruit of the <span class=\"it-text\">ḥaver</span> in the storehouse might not have been tithed. Consequently, the aforementioned case involving produce is a conflict between two uncertain factors, as it is uncertain whether or not the owner was obligated to tithe the produce in the first place, and even if he was required to do so, it is uncertain whether or not the <span class=\"it-text\">ḥaver</span> tithed it.",

            "The Gemara elaborates. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As we </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">learned </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">nine stores </span>in a city, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all of which sell </span>kosher <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">meat </span>from <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughtered </span>animal, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and one </span>other store that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sells meat </span>from unslaughtered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">animal carcasses, and </span>a person <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">took </span>meat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from one</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of them and he does not know from which one</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> he took </span>the meat, in this case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">uncertainty,</span> the meat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is prohibited. </span>This ruling is based on the principle: The legal status of an item fixed in its place is that of an uncertainty that is equally balanced. In this case, when it comes to determining whether or not this meat comes from a kosher store, the two types of stores are regarded as though they were equal in number.", 
            "This <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> continues: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And in </span>the case of meat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">found </span>outside, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">follow</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the majority. </span>If most stores in the city sell kosher meat one can assume that the meat he found is kosher, based on the principle: Any item separated, i.e., not fixed in its place, is presumed to have been separated from the majority. By the same token, if most stores in that city sell non-kosher meat, the meat found is presumed to be non-kosher. These two principles can be applied to the cases involving piles of <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> and leaven: If the morsel was separated from the piles when taken by the mouse, follow the majority. However, if the mouse took the morsel from one of the piles, the legal status of the morsel is that of an equally balanced uncertainty concerning whether it was taken from a pile of <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> or a pile of leaven, and the owner is required to conduct an additional search.", 
            "The Gemara discusses another case: There are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two piles</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> one of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and one of leavened bread, and before them </span>there are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two houses, one </span>which was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">searched and one </span>which was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not searched, and two mice came, </span>and in our presence <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one took </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and one took leavened bread. </span>Each mouse went into a different house, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and we do not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">know which </span>mouse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">entered this </span>house <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and which </span>mouse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">entered </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>house.

Nevertheless, the contents of the <span class=\"it-text\">se’a</span> vessel containing the non-sacred produce <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is permitted, as I sa</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">y</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the non-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sacred produce fell into the non-sacred produce and the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> fell into the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>Likewise, with regard to leaven, presumably the mouse took the leaven into the house that had not been searched, and there is no need to conduct an additional search of the house that was already searched.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this comparison: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Say that we state </span>and apply the principle: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As I say, </span>and assume that everything occurred in a way that preserves the produce in its permitted state"

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda says: One searches </span>for leaven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the evening of the fourteenth </span>of Nisan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and on the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> fourteenth </span>in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the morning, and at the time of </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">removal </span>of leaven. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the Rabbis say: </span>that is not the case; however, if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one did not search on </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the evening of the fourteenth he </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">search on the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fourteenth </span>during the day.",

The Gemara answers: It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Huna who both say: </span>The requirement to conduct three searches <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">corresponds to </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">three </span>times that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the removal </span>of leaven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>mentioned <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the Torah. </span>One verse says: “<span class=\"it-text\">Matzot</span> shall be eaten for seven days, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">no leavened bread shall </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with you, </span>in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7), and another verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Seven days shall there be no leaven found</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in your houses” </span>(Exodus 12:19), while a third verse says: “Seven days shall you eat <span class=\"it-text\">matzot</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">yet on the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first day you shall remove leaven from your houses” </span>(Exodus 12:15).",

Why, then, is there no concern lest one eat the grain at that stage? The Gemara responds: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not difficult, </span>as one also performs <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">grinding </span>in an atypical manner.

            "The above conclusion was that Rabbi Yehuda distinguishes between prohibitions involving substances from which people regularly separate themselves and prohibitions involving substances from which people are not used to keeping their distance.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>did <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Rabbis issue a decree </span>prohibiting the rope <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> weaver due to a standard rope </span>but they did not issue a decree prohibiting a bow due to a knot? The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yes, </span>the Rabbis indeed issued a decree prohibiting the rope of a weaver, as one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">rope may</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be interchanged with </span>another <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">rope, </span>leading one to mistakenly tie a knot with a different rope.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">According to Abaye’s </span>explanation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Rabbi Meir, that he said a person </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does not err </span>about the time <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at all, let him </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat </span>leaven for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the entire sixth </span>hour, as by Torah law it is permitted to eat until the end of the sixth hour, i.e., midday. The Sages issued a decree prohibiting the consumption of leaven from the beginning of the sixth hour, lest one unwittingly come to eat after midday. However, according to Rabbi Meir, people do not err in this regard at all and that concern is unfounded. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And according to that version </span>of Rabbi Meir’s opinion, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>he <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said a person errs a bit, let </span>him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat </span>leaven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">until </span>just before <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the end of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sixth </span>hour.",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, Abaye said: </span>There is a difference between the issues of testimony and leaven, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">testimony is entrusted to the vigilant</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> One comes to testify only if he thoroughly scrutinized the subject of his testimony.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ravina raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava </span>from a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda said: When </span>is it that the elimination of leaven can be performed only by burning it? It is only when one removes the leaven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not at the time </span>designated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its removal. </span>Then, one should seek out the preferred method of removal and implement it in the ideal manner. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>when one removes the leaven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at the time </span>designated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its removal, </span>at the end of the sixth hour when he must remove the leaven immediately, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the removal of </span>leaven may be performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in any manner, </span>and one need not seek wood for burning. Why, then, was it necessary for the Sages to provide him with an hour to gather wood?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, Rava </span>reconsidered the previous explanation and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said:</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> It is a </span>rabbinic <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">decree due to a cloudy day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> when one is unable to observe the precise position of the sun, increasing the likelihood of confusion.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obvious </span>that one may not bring this offering on Passover, as it contains leaven. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Adda </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bar Ahava said: Here </span>this <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> is not referring to the prohibition against bringing the offering on Passover itself.

The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">let us slaughter </span>the thanks-offering to render the loaves permitted.

            "The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And let us bring another</span> animal to replace the first one for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sacrifice and let</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> them slaughter </span>it.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And in accordance with</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> whose </span>opinion is this statement that the slaughter of the animal consecrates the loaves and from that point they can no longer be redeemed?

Rabbi Yosei interprets the end of the verse as: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shall render impure [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">yetamme</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">], </span>indicating that liquid also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">transmits impurity to foods. </span>The Gemara discusses this derivation: Do <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you say </span>that this expression teaches that liquid <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">transmits ritual </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity to foods, or perhaps </span>the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>teaching <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">only </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it transmits impurity to </span>other <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">liquids, </span>but not to food? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">You said </span>in response: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">That was not </span>the correct interpretation.",

Since the vessels were certainly impure when brought to the ritual bath, and it is uncertain whether or not they were immersed, they retain the presumptive status of impurity. However, in cases where the uncertainty is whether or not the vessels were impure at all, then where the impurity is by rabbinic decree, that decree is not in effect in Jerusalem, and the vessels are ritually pure.",

Since it is not prohibited by Torah law, no verse is necessary.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa raised an objection: And </span>yet there is still the prohibition of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the sciatic nerve</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as the Merciful One says: “Therefore the children of Israel may </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not eat the sciatic nerve” </span>(Genesis 32:33), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and we</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> learned </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A person </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">send the thigh</span> of an animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to a gentile </span>as a gift <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the sciatic nerve inside it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> he is not required to remove it.

Therefore, there is no concern that another Jew will assume that the first Jew removed this portion of the animal, which might cause him to accidentally eat the sciatic nerve. Apparently, one may benefit from this prohibited portion of the animal even though the verse says that one may not eat it.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Abbahu holds </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when it was permitted</span> by the Torah to derive benefit from <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an animal carcass</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, it, its fats, and its sinews, </span>such as the sciatic nerve, were all <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted. </span>Therefore, the sciatic nerve is included in this exception and one may benefit from it.

In addition, one violates the prohibition of eating from a non-kosher animal only when it has the flavor of meat. ", 
            "And it indeed follows logically that just as Rabbi Shimon exempts one who eats the sciatic nerve in that particular case, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so too here, Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shimon prohibits </span>deriving <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">benefit </span>from the sciatic nerve. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is permitted to </span>derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">benefit from the sciatic nerve</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">;</span> this is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the statement</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Shimon prohibits </span>it.

Therefore, from the verse that prohibits eating the sciatic nerve he learns that one may not benefit from it either, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Abbahu. Rabbi Abbahu’s position fits according to both opinions.

Therefore, it is possible to say that when the Torah states: “You shall not eat” with regard to this issue, it is teaching that there is a particular prohibition here and that one is flogged for violating it. If so, the verse cannot indicate a general prohibition against deriving benefit.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>this suggestion should be rejected, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Pappa said </span>that one derives this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from here: “And the flesh that touches any </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impure thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with fire. </span>And as for the flesh, every one that is pure may eat of it” (Leviticus 7:19). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As </span>there is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">no </span>need for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse to state: “It shall</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not be eaten,” what </span>does it mean when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> states: “It shall not be eaten”?</span>",

As it is possible to say: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If </span>with regard to the second <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tithe, which is </span>more <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lenient </span>because it does not have the status of an offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Torah said </span>that when one recites the confession over the tithes, when destroying the tithes remaining in one’s possession that had not yet been given to the appropriate recipient, he says: “I have not eaten from it in my mourning, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">neither have I removed it while </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impure” </span>(Deuteronomy 26:14), indicating that it is prohibited for one to remove tithes while impure, then with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">consecrated</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> meat, </span>which is more <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">stringent, all the more so </span>is it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>clear that it may not be eaten while a person is impure?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you say </span>that there is a general principle that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we do not warn, </span>i.e., we may not deduce a prohibition, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">through logical derivatio</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">n</span> alone, then one could respond that his issue is not only derived through an <span class=\"it-text\">a</span> <span class=\"it-text\">fortiori</span> inference; rather, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>also derived from an analogy based on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a juxtaposition. </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it is written: “You may not eat within your </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd </span>or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you have vowed, nor your voluntary offerings, nor the offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17). Since the verse itself juxtaposes tithes to offerings, it indicates that there is a prohibition with regard to offerings just as there is with regard to tithes.", 
            "The Gemara continues explaining Rav Pappa’s opinion: For <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what purpose </span>then does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">state: “It shall not be eaten” </span>with regard to impure consecrated meat? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If it does not </span>apply to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span>subject <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matter </span>of this verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">itself, </span>as that prohibition is derived from the second tithe, then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">apply it to the matter</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of all prohibited </span>items <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the Torah. And if it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> does not </span>apply to the prohibition against <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eating, </span>since that is clear, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">apply it to the prohibition of </span>deriving <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">benefit</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span>", 
            "And if you say: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Lest </span>one say that the verse indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">just as here, </span>the meat that became impure in the Temple is disposed of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> burning, so too, all the prohibited </span>items <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the Torah</span> must be disposed of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with burning, </span>therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: “The leftover,” </span>indicating <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that the leftover </span>sacrificial meat must be disposed of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with burning; however, all </span>other <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prohibited </span>items <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the Torah </span>need <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>be disposed of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with burning.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ravina said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to Rav Ashi: And say </span>that this expression: “It shall not be eaten,” comes to teach not the prohibition against deriving benefit, but rather that one who transgresses this negative mitzva <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">violates two prohibitions. </span>And there is precedent for such an explanation, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">didn’t Abaye say </span>with regard to a parallel case: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If one ate a small water creature</span> [<span class=\"gemarra-italic\">putita</span>], <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he is flogged </span>with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">four </span>sets of lashes because one violates four prohibitions when eating such a creature? Two of these prohibitions are found in the verse that discusses all types of creeping animals: “You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms, neither shall you make yourselves impure with them, that you should be defiled by them” (Leviticus 11:43). A third prohibition applies to creeping animals that live in the water, as the verses say: “And all that have neither fins nor scales…They shall be a detestable thing unto you; you shall not eat of their flesh” (Leviticus 11:10–11). A fourth prohibition is cited in the verse: “And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is impure unto you” (Deuteronomy 14:10). ", 
            "Similarly, if one ate <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an ant</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, he is flogged </span>with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">five </span>sets of lashes, two sets for the previously mentioned prohibitions of eating a creeping animal, a third based on the verse: “And every creeping thing that swarms upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41), and a fourth based on the verse: “All creeping things that swarm upon the earth, them you shall not eat; for they are a detestable thing” (Leviticus 11:42). A fifth prohibition is stated in the verse: “You shall not make yourselves impure through every creeping thing that swarms upon the earth” (Leviticus 11:44). "

        [
            "If one ate <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hornet, he is flogged </span>with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">six </span>sets of lashes. Since a hornet creeps along the ground, all of the previously mentioned prohibitions with regard to an ant apply to it as well. An additional prohibition is stated in the following verse: “And all flying insects are impure to you; they shall not be eaten” (Deuteronomy 14:19). Based on this precedent, it is possible to say that the addition of the phrase “It shall not be eaten” with regard to impure meat indicates merely an additional negative mitzva for which one would be punished; however, it does not necessarily indicate a prohibition to derive benefit. Rav Ashi <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: Anywhere </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that it is possible to expound </span>a new <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">expound, and we do not establish </span>the verse as containing <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">additional negative </span>mitzvot with regard to that same prohibition.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Why do I </span>need <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the beginning </span>of the verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And the flesh that touches any impure thing shall </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not be eaten” </span>(Leviticus 7:19)? The Gemara explains: This comes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to include wood and incense</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">;</span> although they are not eaten, they are susceptible to ritual impurity of foods. The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Why do I </span>need <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the end </span>of this verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And as for the flesh, every one that is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> pure may eat of it” </span>(Leviticus 7:19)? The Gemara answers: This comes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to include </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sacrificial parts </span>of the animal offered on the altar, such as the fats; they, too, have the legal status of meat and are susceptible to ritual impurity of foods.

            "The Gemara answers: This case does not prove a principle, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because the </span><span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">removal of ashes</span> from the altar <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the priestly garments </span>worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are two verses that</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> come as one. </span>The principle is that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two verses </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that come as one do not teach </span>a principle.

            "The Gemara comments: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It works out well</span> that there are two cases <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">according to </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Rabbis, who say </span>that this verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches that </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they require burial. However, according to </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Dosa, who disagrees with them </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">says: </span>These priestly clothes may no longer be used by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but they are fit </span>for use <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">common priest, </span>since these garments are similar to those worn by common priests every day. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And what </span>is the meaning of: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And he shall leave them there”? </span>This indicates <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that</span> the High Priest <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may not use them on another Yom</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Kippur. </span>According to this opinion, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what can be said? </span>According to the opinion of Rabbi Dosa, there is only one verse that teaches about misuse of consecrated property with an item that has already been used for performing its mitzva. Therefore, it should be possible to derive a principle from the verse dealing with the removal of ashes. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: A principle cannot be based on this verse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because removal of ashes and the heifer</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> whose neck is broken</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> from which one may not derive benefit after the ceremony, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are two verses that come</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> as one.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It works out well according</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to the one who said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they do not teach</span> a principle, i.e., according to the Rabbis. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, according</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to the one who said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they do teach </span>a principle, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Sanhedrin</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what can</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be said? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Two </span>phrases indicating <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">exclusions </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are written </span>with regard to these <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span>, limiting this rule to them.

With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written: “The</span> heifer <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which had its neck broken” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:6). The word “the” indicates that this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> applies only to this type of heifer and not to any other similar case.", 
            "After this tangential discussion of the laws of misuse of consecrated property, the Gemara returns to Abaye and Rava’s dispute about the status of unintended benefit, seeking to prove one side or the other. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Come </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hear </span>a proof based on what was taught: If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one brought </span>the heifer whose neck is to be broken or the red heifer <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">into</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a cow pen</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and it threshes </span>grain while walking with other cows, then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is valid. </span>Under normal circumstances, had one used the heifer for work, it would be disqualified from use in its ceremony. However, in this case, the red heifer may still be burned, and the heifer is still fit to have its neck broken in the ritual. Apparently, the verses “Upon which a yoke has not been placed” (Numbers 19:2) and “Which has not been used for work” (Deuteronomy 21:3) still apply to it, because the owner did not intend for it to work. If he brought it in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so that it may nurse </span>from its mother <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and so it will thresh </span>grain, then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> disqualified </span>from use in these rituals.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And here, isn’t it </span>a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was not possible </span>to act differently, as the heifer needs to nurse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and he intended </span>that it thresh the grain? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And it is teaching that </span>the heifer <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is disqualified </span>from use. This proves that when one intends to derive benefit, even if there is no other way to act, it is prohibited to derive benefit. The Gemara rejects this: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is different there, as it is written: “Which has not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> been used for work” in any case. </span>Therefore, while the heifer is disqualified from use even if the situation was unavoidable, no general conclusion can be drawn from this case.", 
            "The Gemara challenges: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> so, </span>that this verse means that it has not performed any work at all, then it should apply <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the first clause. </span>Even when it threshes the grain against the will of the owner, it has still done work and should be rendered disqualified. "
        ], 
        [
            "The Gemara answers. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This </span>case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is comparable only to that </span>other case: If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a bird landed on </span>the red heifer <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it </span>remains <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">valid, </span>since this is not considered to be like bearing a yoke. If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a male </span>animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">mounted i</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">t</span> to mate with it, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is unfit </span>and may not be used for the ritual. The same applies in this case: When the owner moves the heifer into a pen and it threshes, since the owner is uninterested in this action, it is like the case of the bird and the heifer remains valid. The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the reason </span>for the difference between the case where a bird lands on it and where a male animal attempts to mate with it?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Pappa said </span>that the verse says: “And the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not been used for work, and which has not drawn in the yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it were written: “He worked [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">avad</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">],” and we read: “He</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> worked [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">avad</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">],” </span>this word choice would indicate that the heifer could still be used <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">until he, </span>the owner of the heifer himself, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">used it </span>willingly for labor. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were written: “It was worked [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ubbad</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">],” and we read: “It </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was worked [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ubbad</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">],” </span>it would indicate that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even </span>if it performed labor <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on its own it is also </span>prohibited to use it, since some form of labor had been done with it.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Now that it is written: “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He worked [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">avad</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">],” but we read </span>this word as: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It was worked [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ubbad</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">],</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">”</span> both meanings are intended: It is prohibited if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is worked in a similar </span>manner to the way <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he works. </span>In other words, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">just as </span>the owner <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">works </span>the animal in a way <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">beneficial to him, so too, </span>the animal becomes prohibited only when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is worked </span>in a way <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that causes him </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">benefit </span>from this labor. Therefore, it still may be used if a bird lands on it, because the owner does not derive benefit from this in any way. However, if a male bull mates with this heifer it is rendered unfit, since the owner generally has an interest in this occurring. ", 
            "The Gemara cites an additional proof. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Come </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hear </span>from that which is taught: If one finds <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a lost item, he </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not spread it out over a bed or over </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a fram</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for his </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purposes, </span>since this is deriving benefit from an object that does not belong to him. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, he </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">spread it out over a bed or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a frame for its </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sake </span>if it requires airing. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If guests happen </span>to come <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to him, he may not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> spread it out, neither for its sake nor for his</span> own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purpose. </span>Apparently, the benefit is unavoidable and intended, as there is no other way for him to care for the lost object, and he benefits from having his guests see the item; nonetheless, it is still prohibited. This seems to prove that Rava’s opinion is correct. ", 
            "The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> different there, as </span>he risks <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">damaging it, either due to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the evil eye </span>that he casts upon it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">or due</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to the thieves </span>who will now know that this valuable item is in his possession and will attempt to steal it. It is not prohibited because of the benefit; rather, it is prohibited due to the concern that he may damage the item. ", 
            "The Gemara offers a final proof. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Come </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hear </span>a proof based on the following mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Clothing merchants </span>who sell garments made of diverse kinds, a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sell</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> them as they normally would </span>to gentiles. A merchant may place the garments he is selling on his shoulders and need not be concerned about the prohibition against wearing diverse kinds, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">provided he does not intend </span>to benefit from the garments <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the sun </span>as protection <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from the sun, or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in the rain </span>as protection <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from the rain. However, the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> modest </span>people, those who are meticulous in their performance of mitzvot, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">suspend </span>the wool and linen garments <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> stick behind them. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And here, isn’t </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it </span>a case where <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is possible </span>for all clothing merchants <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to act like the modest </span>people and not derive benefit from the mixture of wool and linen? Nonetheless, the mishna states that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when one does not intend </span>to benefit from the prohibited item, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is permitted </span>to do so. This presents <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a conclusive refutation to he who taught the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first version </span>of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava’s </span>statement. According to this version, one is prohibited from deriving benefit when it is possible to avoid doing so and he does not intend to derive benefit. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a conclusive </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">refutation.</span>",

According to this explanation, the connection between the prohibition against deriving benefit from leavened bread that was owned by a Jew during Passover and the verse prohibiting seeing leaven during Passover is clear.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since </span>the statement of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava bar Ahilai was refuted, why </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did Rav say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pots </span>that were used for leavened bread <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on Passover </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be broken? </span>Presumably, their status could be remedied in the same way as was that of this oven, by heating them on a fire until the flavor of the leavened bread absorbed in them was removed. Rav Ashi <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: </span>There is a distinction between these two cases. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">There, </span>it is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a metal </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">oven, </span>which can be cleansed through an additional kindling, while <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">here, </span>it is referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to an earthenware pot, </span>where additional kindling is insufficient, as the earthenware has the capacity to absorb more of the flavor of the leavened bread and it cannot be purged by fire. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you wish, say </span>instead that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">both this, </span>the oven, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that, </span>the pot, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are earthenware, </span>but that the following distinction applies. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This, </span>the oven, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is kindled from the inside, </span>and as the fire is kindled inside the oven itself, it consumes the absorbed flavor of the leavened bread. While <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that, </span>the pot, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is kindled from the outside, </span>such that the flavor of the prohibited material absorbed in the pot is not purged by the fire. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you say, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so too </span>here, in the case of the pot, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> should perform the kindling </span>procedure on the pots from the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">inside </span>to remove that which has been absorbed, this is not reasonable. Presumably, the owner of the pot will <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> concerned lest it burst </span>if he makes the pot too hot. Therefore, he will not use sufficient heat to ensure that the leavened bread that has been absorbed will be completely purged. ",

But if he fills it with </span>burning <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">coals, </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> seems well </span>and it can be used afterward.

            "Before bringing proofs for either side of this dispute, the Gemara attempts to clarify Rava’s position. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Did Rava </span>actually <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say this? </span>A statement he makes in a different context appears to contradict the one made in his name here. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But didn’t Rami bar Ḥama say</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: Reuven sold a fiel</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to Shimon with a guarantee </span>that if the field is repossessed, Reuven will compensate Shimon for his loss. Shimon did not pay for the purchase, and instead <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">set up </span>the value of the field <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as a loan. </span>In the meantime, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Reuven died and a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> creditor of Reuven’s came </span>to collect for a loan that Reuven had taken before he sold the field, as Reuven had no other land remaining, and he <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">seized </span>the land <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from Shimon, </span>since it was mortgaged to this loan. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Shimon went and appeased </span>the creditor <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with money </span>so the creditor would allow him to keep this field.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">By right, Reuven’s sons </span>can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">come and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say to Shimon </span>that he must pay them the money that he owes for the field. And they are not required to pay Shimon if he demands compensation for the repossession of his field. They can say that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">our father </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">left us movable property in your hands, </span>i.e., the money you owe us for the field, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and, </span>as a general rule, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">movable property that has been left to orphans</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is not mortgaged to a creditor</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> The orphans can claim that the field belongs to Shimon, and as there is no land left for the orphans, there is no way for Shimon to recover the compensation that he is owed. The money he owes Reuven is considered movable property, and therefore he cannot recover his losses from these funds. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rava said</span> with regard to this case: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If Shimon is cleve</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">r</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he will pay them </span>what he owes with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">real estate </span>and not with money. Since they now have real estate received from their father’s estate, Shimon <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">can then collect </span>the field <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from them </span>as compensation for the original field that Reuven sold to Shimon. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As Rav Naḥman said: </span>When <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">orphans collect real estat</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for a debt owed to their</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> father </span>from one person, another <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">creditor can come and seize</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> this </span>land <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from them </span>in order to repay the father’s debt. ", 
            "The Gemara applies this discussion to our original case. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Granted, if you say</span> that a creditor <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">collects retroactively, </span>and the field is considered as though it belonged to the creditor from the time of the loan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">due to this </span>reason, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he can then</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> collect </span>the money <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from them, because it is considered as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> though he collected it during their father’s lifetime. </span>Because the field given by Shimon to repay his debt retroactively belonged to Reuven from the time that Shimon agreed to pay for the field, therefore Shimon can now claim this land from Reuven’s heirs. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, if you say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he collects </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from this point forward, why can </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he then collect </span>this land <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from them? It is as </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">though the orphans purchased this property. And if orphans buy </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">property, does </span>it become <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">indebted to a creditor </span>of their father? Only property that belonged to the father can be seized in order to pay back his debt, and therefore Rava’s statement in the case appears to contradict his statement with regard to the transfer of ownership of collateral. ", 
            "The Gemara resolves this contradiction: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is different there, </span>in this case, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span>Shimon could have <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to </span>Reuven’s children that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">just as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> I am indebted to your father, so too, I am</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> indebted to your father’s creditor. </span>And this principle can be learned <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the statement <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Rabbi Natan </span>that one who lends to one person and borrows from another can be considered as a middleman between his creditor and his borrower. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Natan</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> says: From where </span>is it derived <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that when one lends</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> one hundred </span>dinar <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">[</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">maneh</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] to his fellow, and that fellow</span> lends a similar sum <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>a third <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fellow, that we</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> take </span>the money <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from this one, </span>the second debtor, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and give it to that one, </span>the first creditor, without going through the middleman, who is both the first debtor and the second creditor? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The verse states: “And he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shall give it to him whom he has wronged” </span>(Numbers 5:7), which indicates that the loan should be repaid to the creditor to whom the money is ultimately owed. Therefore, payment is made to the original creditor regardless of the issue of retroactive acquisition of the collateral. ", 
            "The Gemara proceeds to bring proofs for the two sides of the question of retroactive acquisition. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">We learned</span> in the mishna: If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a gentile lent money to a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Jew, </span>and the Jew gave him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">leavened bread as </span>collateral during Passover, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after Passover </span>the gentile attained this leavened bread in lieu of payment, then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one is permitted </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">benefit from </span>the leavened bread. The Gemara attempts to clarify this position: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Granted, if you say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> retroactively collects </span>this property, and the leavened bread was acquired retroactively by the gentile, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is due to this </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one is permitted to </span>derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">benefit from it </span>after Passover. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But if you say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he collects </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it from this point forward, </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">why </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one be </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted to </span>derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">benefit from </span>this leavened bread? The leavened bread <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was in the possession of a Jew </span>during Passover, and therefore it should be forbidden. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">With</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> what are we dealing here? </span>With a case where <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> deposited [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">hirhin</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span> the leavened bread <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with </span>the gentile in his home, and since the leavened bread was in the gentile’s possession during Passover, it is considered as if it belonged to the gentile, provided the gentile ultimately retains ownership of the leavened bread when the Jew defaults on the loan. ", 
            "The Gemara suggests: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let us say </span>that this dispute is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">tanna’im</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>As it was taught: If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Jew lends money to a gentile </span>and the gentile gives him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">leavened bread as </span>collateral, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">then </span>the Jew <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not commit any transgression after Passover. They said in the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> name of Rabbi Meir that he commits a transgression</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> What, isn’t it that they disagree about this, that</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> one Sage, </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">holds </span>that the Jew transgresses by owning leavened bread <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because he retroactively collects </span>the leavened bread and has therefore owned it during Passover, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and one Sage</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>who states that the Jew does not commit a transgression, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">holds </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he collects it from this point forward, </span>and therefore it was not considered to be in his possession during Passover? ", 
            "The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>how can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you understand</span> it that way? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Say the latter clause </span>of that <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, if a gentile lends </span>money <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to a Jew </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with leavened bread </span>as collateral, then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after Passover everyone agrees</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that he commits a transgression. However, </span>if the preceding explanation is correct, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it needed </span>to state <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the opposite </span>of what it said in the first clause, as the case in the latter clause is the reverse of that in the first clause. Namely, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">according to the one who </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said there, </span>in the first clause of the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he does not commit a transgression, </span>he should say that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">here, </span>in this case, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he does commit a transgression. </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And according to the one who said there, </span>in the first clause of the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he does commit a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">transgression, </span>he should say that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">here, </span>in the latter clause, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he does not commit a transgression. </span>For if the creditor retroactively acquires the collateral, then it is as though it belonged to a gentile during Passover, and therefore the Jew would not have committed a transgression by owning it.

            "The Gemara applies this principle to the explanation of the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The first</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">tanna</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> holds </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this applies only when a Jew </span>takes collateral <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from a </span>fellow <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Jew, such that I would read</span> and apply the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“It shall be righteousness for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you” </span>and establish that the collateral becomes the property of the lender. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>the verse does not speak about the case where <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Jew </span>takes collateral <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from a gentile, </span>and therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he does not acquire </span>the collateral; it still belongs to the gentile. Therefore, when a Jew has leavened bread as collateral from a gentile to whom he lent money on Passover, he does not violate any prohibition, as the collateral still belongs to the gentile. ", 
            "However, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that one can derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">a</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">fortiori</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> inference: </span>If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Jew acquires </span>collateral <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from</span> another <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Jew, all the more so </span>is it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>clear that he will he acquire collateral <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from a gentile?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Abaye said: Actually </span>one can explain that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he </span>must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">repay according to the monetary </span>value of the <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and why </span>is it stated that a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">blessing </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">rest upon him? </span>This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because he ate an </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">item that buyers don’t jump at, </span>i.e., it is undesirable to buyers, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but paid with an item </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that buyers jump at</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> Consequently, although the produce he gives is worth no more than the produce he ate, the priest still prefers this type of payment, as he can more easily resell this produce.

            "The Gemara seeks proof with regard to this dispute: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">One who unwittingly eats </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of leavened bread on Passover </span>must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pay the principal and an </span>additional <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fifth.

Certainly it is not worth anything, given that it is forbidden to benefit from this food. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yes, </span>this leavened bread does indeed have monetary value.

            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He holds in accordance </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana, as it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana rendered </span>the status of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yom Kippur the same as </span>that of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shabbat with regard to payment. </span>In his opinion, not only a person who committed a transgression punishable by a court-administered capital punishment, like one who desecrated Shabbat, is exempt from monetary payment incurred at the time of the transgression. Even one who is deserving of a divinely administered capital punishment, such as one who desecrates Yom Kippur and is punished with <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>, is exempt from monetary payment for property he damaged in the course of such an act.

This must be the explanation, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if you do not say so, </span>it is difficult to reconcile this mishna with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that which was taught </span>in the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> cited above: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">To what </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>case of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> of leavened bread <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be compared? </span>It may be compared <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of berries, olives, and grape</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that became impure, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which can neither be eaten nor burned. </span>However, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they may even be eaten, as </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if one wishes he may tread less than an egg-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bulk </span>at a time.

It means that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they are prohibited</span> to be eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by non-priests, </span>but a priest may eat them. Once these saplings are planted, they lose their ritual impurity but retain their status as <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>. Rava bar Mattana challenged this answer: If this is the case, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is </span>the mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaching us </span>with this statement? Is it teaching us that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">growths of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span> are considered <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">? </span>It is unnecessary to teach this principle, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we </span>already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">learned</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: Growths of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>i.e., produce that grows from <span class=\"it-text\">terum</span><span class=\"it-text\">a</span> that was planted in the ground, are considered <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> Why, then, is it necessary to teach this principle again?

While most seeds will disintegrate, other plants, such as onions and garlic, merely continue growing when planted.

There would be no need for the mishna to teach us this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> a second time. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They were silent </span>and did not have an answer to this question.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They said to</span> Rava bar Mattana: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Have you heard something in this </span>regard? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He said to them: This is what Rav Sheshet </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: What </span>is the meaning of the word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prohibited </span>in this context?

Therefore, these <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> saplings are treated as though they have become impure once the priest diverts attention from them, and they remain prohibited to him even after another generation grows from them. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Granted</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, according to the one who says </span>that a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diversion </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of attention constitutes an inherent disqualification</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it works out </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">well. </span>According to this opinion, a diversion of attention does not disqualify <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> due to a concern that it became impure. Instead, there is an independent rabbinic decree rendering <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> that has not been watched impure even when this <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> could not possibly have become impure. According to this opinion, one can understand why this growth may not be eaten by a priest. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But according to the one who says</span> that a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diversion of attention is a disqualification due to</span> a concern about <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity, what is there to say</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">? </span>It is stated in the mishna that by planting these saplings they become pure, even if they were certainly ritually impure prior to being planted. If this is the case with regard to <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> that is certainly impure, all the more so should it apply to a case where there is only a chance that the <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> is ritually impure.", 
            "Apropos the discussion of diversion of attention, the Gemara cites a dispute between <span class=\"it-text\">amora’im</span> with regard to this issue, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was stated: </span>What is the nature of the disqualification of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diversion of attention? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disqualification </span>due to a concern about <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity </span>that may have been contracted while one’s attention was diverted. And <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: It is an inherent disqualification. </span>", 
            "The Gemara discusses the ramifications of this dispute: According to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said it is a disqualification </span>due to a concern about <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity, if Elijah comes and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">renders it ritually pure </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we will listen to him, </span>because it was treated as impure only due to a doubt with regard to its actual status. However, according to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, </span>who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is an </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">inherent disqualification, </span>even <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if Elijah comes and renders it pure </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we will not listen to him. </span>The reason for this is that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish believes that this decree is unrelated to the question of whether the object actually became impure.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">objection to </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish </span>based on what is taught in the <span class=\"it-text\">Tosefta</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yishmael, son </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: There was a small gap</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> between the ramp and the altar on the western</span> side <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of the ramp, where they would throw disqualified birds</span> that had been designated as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sin-offerings. </span>If birds became disqualified for any reason, such as a diversion of attention, they were left there <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">until their form decayed, </span>i.e., until the next morning, at which point they would be definitively disqualified due to remaining in the Temple overnight and could be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taken out to the place </span>designated for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">burning. Granted, if you say </span>that a diversion of attention <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is a disqualification </span>due to a concern for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for this reason it requires decay of for</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">m</span> to ensure that the bird is certainly disqualified. Currently the bird is disqualified only due to uncertainty, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and Elijah may come and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> render it ritually pure. However, if you say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is an inherent disqualification, </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">why do I </span>need to leave it until <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it has decay of form? </span>It should be definitively disqualified once there has been a diversion of attention. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this is the principle: </span>"

As Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">grapes that became ritually impure</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, if one trod on them and afterward consecrated them, they</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> are pure</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> According to this opinion, the wine inside the grape does not become impure from the grape itself. However, if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he consecrated </span>the grapes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and afterward pressed them</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, they are impure, </span>because the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is especially stringent with regard consecrated items. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And yet </span>with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">grapes </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which are </span>only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">consecrated through speech, </span>as the wine/grapes offered on the altar are not brought in a sacred vessel, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even so, the Sages imposed a higher </span>standard such that these grapes become impure after they have been consecrated.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Yosef said: </span>This case does not serve as a proof since <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">spoke of grapes, and here we are dealing with grapes </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, whose consecration through speech is comparable to consecration</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in a </span>sacred <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">vessel, </span>as <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> cannot be consecrated by being placed in a sacred vessel. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">those </span>items <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that require a </span>sacred <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">vessel </span>in order to be fully consecrated, such as water used for a libation, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Sages did not impose a higher </span>standard in a case where one consecrated it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">through speech. </span>Therefore, this case cannot be used to resolve Abaye’s question. ", 
            "The Gemara asks about Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement with regard to wine pressed from impure grapes: The phrase <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if one tread upon them </span>is stated without qualification, indicating that the wine is ritually pure <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even </span>if he pressed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">many </span>grapes at once. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say this? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">grapes that became ritually impure grapes, one </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tread </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on them less than an egg-bulk at a time. </span>When there is less than an egg-bulk of grapes, they do not impart ritual impurity.

            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If you wish, say </span>this answer: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Here, too, </span>it is to be understood that one must tread on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">less than an egg-bulk at </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a time. And if you wish, say </span>this answer instead: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">There, </span>where the Gemara requires less than an egg-bulk, it is a case where the grapes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">came into contact</span> with an item that was impure with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first-</span>degree ritual impurity, such <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that they became </span>impure with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second-</span>degree ritual impurity. When a liquid touches an object that is impure with second-degree ritual impurity, it becomes impure by rabbinic decree with first-degree ritual impurity.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said: We, too, have learned </span>that the Sages created higher standards with regard to consecrated items.

On the other hand, the verse says <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“and he shall put,” </span>meaning that the water should be poured into the vessel. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently </span>the water <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is detached</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> but it is </span>clearly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">attached </span>to the spring, as it was previously stated that the water must flow directly into the vessel.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>this is merely <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a higher standard, </span>as by Torah law the water may be drawn with one vessel and sanctified in another vessel. The Sages added that this water must be sanctified in the same vessel in which it was drawn from the spring, and they found support for their opinion in the Torah. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Here too, </span>the Sages established <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a higher standard</span> for a consecrated object that became ritually impure, as they decreed that it cannot be ritually purified through insertion in the ground.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Shimi bar</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Ashi said: We, too, learned </span>a similar statement in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: When the period of ritual impurity of a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> or leper has been completed, and he <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed </span>during the day <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and emerged, </span>he may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat tithes </span>immediately.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ashi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: We, too, learned </span>another case where the Sages established a higher standard.

The mishna taught that one can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill </span>his obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with doubtfully tithed produc</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and </span>with produce <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first tithe, </span>from which <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> has been separated. The Gemara asks: Can one really fulfill his obligation with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">doubtfully tithed produce? </span>It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not suitable</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for him </span>to eat. The Sages prohibited the eating of doubtfully tithed produce that has not been tithed. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since, if one </span>so <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">desires </span>he may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">renounce </span>all <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his property, </span>thereby becoming a poor person who is permitted to eat doubtfully tithed produce, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">now too it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">suitable for him, </span>even though he did not declare his property ownerless. Consequently, if he used doubtfully tithed produce as <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, he has fulfilled the mitzva after the fact. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">One </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">feed the poor doubtfully tithed produce</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, and </span>he may also feed Jewish <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">soldiers [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">akhsanya</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span> who lodge with him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">doubtfully tithed produce</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> And Rav Huna</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said </span>that it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was taught </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Shammai say: One</span> may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">neither feed the poor doubtfully tithed produce, nor </span>feed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">soldiers doubtfully tithed produce. And Beit Hillel say: One </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">feed </span>these groups doubtfully tithed produce. This mishna indicates that doubtfully tithed produce is not prohibited to the same extent as entirely untithed produce, as in certain situations the prohibition pertaining to doubtfully tithed produce does not take effect.

            "The mishna taught that one can fulfill the obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> with produce of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first tithe from </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which its </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> of the tithe, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was taken </span>and given to a priest. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obvious, as, since its </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> has been taken, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is non-sacred </span>food? What novel element is taught by this statement? ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">No, </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">necessary </span>to teach the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> in a case where a Levite <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">preceded </span>the priest while the grain was still <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on </span>its <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">stalks</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> Ordinarily, the Levite would be given his first tithe only after the priest had taken the <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> <span class=\"it-text\">gedola</span>; however, in this case the Levite took his portion before the priest. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of the tithe was </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taken </span>by the Levite from his tithe so that he would be permitted to eat the tithe; however, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">gedola</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was not taken from </span>the produce at all. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And</span> the novel element of the mishna is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Abbahu. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As Rabbi Abbahu said</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: First tithe </span>in which the Levite <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">preceded </span>the priest while the grain was still <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the stalks is exempt from </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">gedola</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>even though the Levite thereby reduces the amount of grain the priest receives. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it is stated: </span>“Moreover you shall speak to the Levites and say to them: When you take from the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them as your inheritance, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and you </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shall set apart from it a gift for the Lord, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a tithe from the tithe” </span>(Numbers 18:26). This verse teaches that the Levite is obligated to set apart <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a tithe</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from the tithe, </span>i.e., the <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> of the tithe, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and not </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">gedola</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of the tithe</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from the tithe. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Pappa said to Abaye: However, if </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is so, even</span> if the Levite <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">preceded </span>the priest after the kernels of grain were removed from the stalks and placed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> pile, </span>the Levite should not have to separate <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> <span class=\"it-text\">gedola</span> in this case either. Abaye <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: With regard</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to your </span>claim, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: “From all that is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> given to you, you shall set apart all of that</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> which is the Lord’s </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>of all the best of it, even its consecrated portion” (Numbers 18:29). This verse teaches that the Levites must designate a portion of the gifts they receive and give it to the priests. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And what did you see </span>to lead you to require the separation of <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> <span class=\"it-text\">gedola</span> from first tithe that was taken from grain in piles and not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This </span>produce, after being threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">has become grain</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">;</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and that </span>produce on the stalk <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did not </span>yet <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">become </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">grain, </span>and the Levite is therefore exempt from separating <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> <span class=\"it-text\">gedola</span> from it. Produce that has been arranged in a pile is called grain by the Torah and is given to the priest. Once it is classified as grain, the right of the priest takes effect and the Levite is required to separate <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> <span class=\"it-text\">gedola</span> from it.", 
            "The mishna taught that one can fulfill his obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second-tithe </span>grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">consecrated </span>grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that was redeemed. </span>The Gemara asks: It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obvious </span>that this is the case, as consecrated grain that has been redeemed is non-sacred produce. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case where the consecrated property was not completely redeemed, i.e., <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where one gave </span>payment for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the principal, </span>the value of the tithe, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but he did not give </span>payment for the additional <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fifth </span>due when redeeming consecrated items. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches us </span>that failure to add <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fifth does not invalidate </span>the redemption. Although there is an obligation to pay this additional fifth, the neglect of this duty does not prevent the grain from becoming non-sacred.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the mishna further taught that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">priests </span>can fulfill their obligation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with </span><span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> of <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥalla</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and with </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> The Gemara again asks: It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obvious </span>that this is the case. Since a priest is permitted to eat <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span> and <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, he can fulfill his obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> with them. The Gemara responds: This ruling is nevertheless necessary, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lest you say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we require </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span> that may be eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">equally by anyone, </span>which would mean that <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> that may not be eaten by regular Israelites is prohibited to priests as well. The mishna therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">us </span>that the repetition of the words <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matzot</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,” “</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matzot</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Deuteronomy 16:3, 8) comes to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">amplify, </span>i.e., one can fulfill one’s obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> even with foods that may be eaten only by specific people.", 
            "We learned in the mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>one may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>fulfill this obligation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with untithed produce</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> The Gemara asks: It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obvious </span>that this is the case, as it is always prohibited to eat <span class=\"it-text\">tevel</span>. The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">No, it is necessary </span>to teach this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> in a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where </span>it is considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">untithed produce </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by rabbinic </span>law, and by Torah law the produce is permitted. For instance, this is the case with regard to grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that one sowed in an unperforated flowerpot. </span>Anything grown disconnected from the ground is not defined as produce of the ground, and its owner is exempt by Torah law from tithing it. However, by rabbinic law, grain sowed in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an unperforated flowerpot </span>is considered untithed. ", 
            "It was also taught in the mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>one does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>fulfill his obligation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with </span><span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> from produce <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first tithe</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, whose </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span><span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> of the tithe, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was not taken. </span>The Gemara asks: It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obvious </span>that this is the case, as this produce may not be eaten. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">No, </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">necessary </span>for the mishna to teach this with regard to a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where </span>the Levite <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">preceded </span>the priest after the kernels of grain were placed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> pile </span>but before <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> <span class=\"it-text\">gedola</span> was separated from the produce.

Therefore, one may not eat this produce before separating <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> <span class=\"it-text\">gedola</span> from it.", 
            "It was further taught in the mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>one does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>fulfill his obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with second-tithe </span>produce <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">or</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> consecrated </span>grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that was not redeemed. </span>The Gemara asks: Isn’t that, too, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obvious, </span>as it is prohibited to eat these foods?", 
            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Actually, </span>this is speaking of a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where they were redeemed, and what </span>is the meaning of the expression: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They were not redeemed? </span>It means <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that they </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were not redeemed properly, </span>e.g., <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second-tithe </span>grain that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was redeemed with an unminted coin [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">asimon</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> As the Merciful One</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> says </span>with regard to the redemption of the second tithe: “And you shall turn it into money, and bind up the money in your hand, and go to the place which the Lord your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 14:25). The phrase <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“and bind up [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ve’tzarta</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] the money” </span>indicates that the produce must be exchanged for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an object </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that has a form [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">tzura</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">], </span>not unminted metal.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Yosei </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">HaGelili </span>could respond: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Do we vocalize </span>the word as <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ani</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> as would be appropriate for a phrase meaning a poor man’s bread? In fact, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we vocalize </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">oni</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>which means oppression, affliction, or mourning. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Akiva </span>could retort: The fact <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that we vocalize </span>the word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">oni</span> is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>a statement of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shmuel.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Akiva maintain</span> with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">dough that was kneaded with wine, oil</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, or honey, </span>that it may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>be used for <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">One </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not knead dough on Passover with wine, oil, or honey</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?

            "The <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> continues: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And although one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not knead </span>dough with these ingredients, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">spread </span>these substances on the surface of the dough. The Gemara comments: With regard to this latter statement, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we have come </span>back <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> first </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">tanna</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>who said that one may not knead bread with wine, oil, or honey. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the Rabbis say: </span>With regard to dough <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">into which one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">knead </span>wine, oil, or honey, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>may likewise <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">spread </span>them on the dough, whereas concerning dough <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">into which one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not knead </span>these ingredients, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not sprea</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> them on the dough either. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And everyone agrees that one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not knead the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">dough with warm </span>water, as this will cause it to be leavened quickly. In any case, it is evident from here that Rabbi Akiva himself prepared <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> with wine, oil, and honey. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not difficult, </span>as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>statement of Rabbi Akiva’s, which maintains that one does not fulfill his obligation with <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> prepared with wine, oil, and honey, is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the first day of the Festival, </span>during which there is a special commandment to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>. However, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>second <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, in which Rabbi Akiva states that he prepared this type of dough himself, pertains to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second day </span>of Passover, when no special requirement to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> is in effect. On the second day, there is no mitzva to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>. It is only forbidden to own or eat leavened bread; consequently so-called rich, or enhanced <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, prepared from fruit juices, is permitted. ", 
            "The Gemara adds that this is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as Rabbi Yehoshua said to his sons: </span>On <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> first night </span>of Passover, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do not knead for me </span>dough <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with milk, </span>but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the first night <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">onward, knead </span>my dough for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">me with milk. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: Throughout the whole year <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not knead dough with milk, and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> if he kneaded </span>dough with milk, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the entire bread is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> prohibited, due to </span>the fact that one will become <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">accustomed</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to sin, </span>by unwittingly eating it with meat? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, this is what he is saying: </span>On <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the first </span>night of Passover <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do not knead me </span>dough <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with honey; </span>however, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from then onward, knead me </span>dough <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with honey. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you wish</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, say </span>instead that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">actually, </span>Rabbi Yehoshua said: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">With milk, as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Ravina said: </span>If this bread, kneaded with milk, is prepared in the shape <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of an ox’s eye, it is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> permitted. </span>In other words, if one forms this dough in a unique shape, e.g., the eye of an ox, one may eat it, as it is clearly distinguishable from ordinary bread. Therefore, there is no concern that it will be eaten with meat. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Here too, </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> is speaking about a case where he told them to prepare this <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> in the shape <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of an ox’s eye.</span>", 
            "It was incidentally mentioned in the previous <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And everyone </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">agrees that one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not knead dough with warm </span>water. The Gemara asks: In <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what </span>way <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>this case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">different</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from </span>that of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">meal-offerings</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">All meal-offerings are kneaded with warm wate</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">r</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and are watched so that they will not be </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">leavened. </span>The Gemara explains that there is a distinction between these two cases: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If they say </span>it is permitted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diligent </span>priests to bake with warm water, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shall they </span>also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>the same with regard <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to those who are not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diligent? </span>The priests are diligent and expert in the Temple service and are able to take extreme care, but not everyone can be relied upon to guard the dough unfailingly. ", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, </span>if we rely on the diligence of the priests, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">let them also soak </span>the grains in water to help them remove the husks. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Why</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> did Rabbi Zeira say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba bar Yirmeya said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">wheat </span>used <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> meal-offerings, one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not soak it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?</span> The Gemara answers: The <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">kneading </span>of the dough <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by diligent</span> priests; however, the act of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">soaking is not </span>performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> diligent </span>priests.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">kneading, is it</span> performed only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by diligent </span>priests? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But isn’t it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> written: </span>“And when any one brings a meal-offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and he shall pour oil upon it, </span>and place frankincense upon it. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And he shall bring it to </span>Aaron’s sons <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the priests; </span>and he shall take from it his handful of its fine flour, and of its oil, together with all its frankincense” (Leviticus 2:1–2).

            "The Gemara answers: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">kneading, although </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is not </span>performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diligent </span>priests, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is </span>nevertheless performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">place of </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diligent. </span>Kneading may be carried out by a non-priest, but it must still be performed in the Temple courtyard. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As the Master said: Mixing is valid </span>if performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by a non-priest; </span>however, if it is conducted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">outside </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the walls of the courtyard</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it, </span>the meal offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is disqualified. </span>This serves <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to exclude soaking, which is neither</span> performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diligent nor </span>performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">place of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the diligent. </span>",

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And what did you see </span>that led you <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">include second-tithe </span>produce due to the words <span class=\"it-text\">matzot</span> <span class=\"it-text\">matzot</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but to exclude first fruits? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">I include </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second tithe, which has </span>a means by which it may be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted </span>to be eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in all habitations, </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>as will be explained. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And I exclude first fruits, which do not have, </span>under any circumstances, a manner by which it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted</span> to eat them <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in all habitations. </span>",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>it is derived by means of a verbal analogy that this <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">carrying [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">se’et</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] is nothing other </span>than <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eating</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> as it is stated: “And portions [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">masot</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] were taken</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to them from before him” </span>(Genesis 43:34). In light of this parallel language, the Gemara understands the phrase “so that you are not able <span class=\"it-text\">se’eto</span>” to mean: So that you are not able to eat it. Like second-tithe produce that has not yet been taken into Jerusalem, second-tithe produce in the capital that cannot be eaten due to ritual impurity can be redeemed and taken out of the city.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Shimon </span>says in response to this contention: First fruits <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are called </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> by the Merciful One </span>and therefore their status is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">like </span>that of <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: Just </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is permitted to an acute mourner, so too </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first fruits </span>are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted to an acute mourner. </span>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Shimon, although he does not</span> accept this <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">juxtaposition </span>of first fruits and second tithe, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> any case </span>the word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">joy is written with regard to</span> first fruits, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is written: “And you shall rejoice</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in all the good </span>that the Lord has given you and your household” (Deuteronomy 26:11).

            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon does not learn from <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that</span> verse that one must eat first fruits while he is personally happy; rather, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it comes </span>to teach us <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>first fruits should be eaten during the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">period of rejoicing.

            "The Gemara explains: Unlike Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Akiva does not interpret the phrase “poor man’s bread [<span class=\"it-text\">leḥem</span> <span class=\"it-text\">oni</span>]” as though it were written with an <span class=\"it-text\">alef</span>, which indicates that it is referring to the bread of acute mourning [<span class=\"it-text\">aninut</span>], i.e., the period of mourning on the day of the death of a close relative. Consequently, the following dilemma arises: It can be suggested that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is with </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">non-sacred</span> portion of the second-tithe produce <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that one </span>can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill</span> his obligation, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for if </span>the produce <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">becomes ritually impure </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">can be permitted </span>to be eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>any <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">habitation </span>in Israel after it has been redeemed. Rabbi Akiva agrees that any food that can be eaten in an unrestricted manner in certain circumstances can also be used for the obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥalla</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, which</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, if becomes ritually impure, cannot be permitted </span>to be eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>any <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">habitation, but goes, </span>i.e., it is slated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for burning, </span>this <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">cannot </span>be used to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill </span>one’s obligation. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Or perhaps we say: Since</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> if</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> one had not designated </span>the produce as <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> had become ritually impure, </span>it could be redeemed and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> permitted </span>to be eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>any <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">habitation, </span>and one could <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill </span>the obligation of <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with it, now too,</span> one can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill </span>his obligation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with it, </span>despite the fact that it has been designated as <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span>. Since the sanctity is not inherent in the dough itself, it does not undermine its status as fit for <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Some say </span>a different version of this analysis: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>case, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">certainly do not raise the dilemma, as </span>here <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we certainly </span>apply the principle of: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since, </span>as stated above. In other words, there is no doubt that <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span> taken from second-tithe produce can be used for <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, as its sanctity is not inherent. Rather, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when you raise the dilemma, </span>it is with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥalla</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that was purchased with</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> second-tithe money, </span>as this type of food can be ritually purified if it becomes ritually impure. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>furthermore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Rabbis, do not raise </span>this <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">dilemma, since they say</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">can be redeemed </span>for a second time; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this</span> case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>identical to the case of second-<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tithe </span>produce itself. In this regard, the Rabbis do not distinguish between the money with which the second tithe was redeemed and the second-tithe produce itself. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, when you raise the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> dilemma, </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda, who said </span>that an object that was purchased with second-tithe money and that became ritually impure must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be buried. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As we learned </span>in a mishna with regard to food <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that was purchased with second-tithe </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">money that became ritually impure</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> this ritually impure food should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be redeemed </span>for money, with which one must purchase other food. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>It should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be buried. </span>Since this food was merely purchased with second-tithe money, it does not have the same degree of sanctity as the tithe itself. Therefore, its status as a second-tithe object cannot be transferred to yet a third object. Consequently, if it becomes impure, it cannot be redeemed for money but must be buried as an item for which there is no use. ", 
            "The Gemara clarifies the aforementioned dilemma: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Do </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we say </span>the following: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since, if it were not purchased </span>with second-tithe money, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>furthermore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since, if one had </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not designated it </span>as <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it became ritually impure, </span>this produce would be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted </span>to be eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>any <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">habitation, </span>one can therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill </span>his obligation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with it </span>even after its status has changed by being purchased with second-tithe money and designated as <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span>? ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Or perhaps we say </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>of these logical arguments starting with: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since, but we </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do not say two </span>arguments of: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since. </span>If so, one cannot fulfill his obligation with <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> of <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span> separated from second tithe. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said: It stands to reason </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">category of tithe is a single </span>designation. In other words, provided that the food is included in the general framework of second tithe, it can be used for <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, and this applies even to the <span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span> separated from second tithe. ", 
            "We learned in the mishna that if one prepared the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">loaves </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers </span>for himself, he cannot use them to fulfill his obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> on Passover.

The Gemara answers: It must be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">similar to </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">; just as </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span> is prepared from plants <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>are fit for human consumption and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">can be </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purchased with </span>second-<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tithe money, so too, bitter herbs </span>must be from a species <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that can be purchased with </span>second-<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tithe money. </span>",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava raised an objection </span>from a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Ḥazeret</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥazeret gallin</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">; endive and wild </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">endive; leek and wild leek; coriander and wild coriander; mustard </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and Egyptian mustard; and Egyptian gourd and </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">harmutza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>a type of gourd, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are not </span>considered a mixture of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">diverse kind</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span> when planted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">together. </span>This indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥazeret</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥazeret gallin</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> yes, </span>they may be planted together; however, <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥazeret</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and endives, no, </span>they may not be planted together.

Now </span>that it has been mentioned that in the case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>where the obligation applies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by Torah </span>law, one can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill </span>his <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obligation </span>with second tithe in this manner, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">necessary </span>to mention that one can use second tithe for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bitter herbs, which</span> nowadays applies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by rabbinic </span>law, as there is no Paschal lamb? ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When you raise the dilemma, </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, </span>who maintains that one cannot fulfill his obligation with <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> of second-tithe produce. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to bitter herbs? The Gemara explains the two sides of this dilemma: Does Rabbi Yosei HaGelili say <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is </span>only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with regard to </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span> of second-tithe produce, where the obligation applies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by Torah </span>law, that one does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not fulfill </span>the mitzva; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">however, </span>with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bitter herbs, </span>a mitzva that applies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by rabbinic </span>la<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">w, </span>one can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill </span>his obligation with this second-tithe produce? ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Or perhaps, everything</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that the Sages instituted, they instituted </span>in a manner <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">similar</span> to the model provided <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by Torah </span>law. If this principle is accepted, it would mean the following: Just as one may not use second-tithe produce for <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, so too, one may not use second tithe as bitter herbs, despite the fact that the obligation to eat them is rabbinic. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said: It stands to reason </span>that since the verse juxtaposes <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and bitter herbs, </span>similar restrictions apply to both mitzvot. Consequently, just as according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili one cannot use second-tithe produce for <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>, so too, one cannot use this produce for bitter herbs. ",

            "As for flour <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in villages, what is the reason </span>that it is ritually pure?

            "Rava answered: You should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">interpret </span>the distinction of the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> as referring only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>ordinary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">flour, </span>not refined flour, which is invariably susceptible to ritual impurity due to the soaking. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">After </span>Rava <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">left, </span>Rav Pappa <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: What is the reason </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he did not say </span>a proof <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from this </span>statement <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Yirmeya said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">wheat </span>that will be used <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for meal-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offerings, one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not soak it, </span>and yet it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>nonetheless <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">called refined flour? </span>The Torah insists that the flour used for meal-offerings be prepared from refined flour.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava </span>reconsidered and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">then said: </span>It is not only permitted to soak the grains; it is actually <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a mitzva </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to soak </span>them, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is stated: “And you </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shall guard the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matzot</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Exodus 12:17). The Gemara explains this statement: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>the case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">requires</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> soaking, for what </span>purpose is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guarding </span>necessary? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If </span>you claim that this verse is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guarding when kneading, </span>that cannot be the case, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guarding </span>grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">while kneading </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is not </span>considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guarding. </span>If one failed to protect the wheat from becoming leavened up to that point, it is of no use to be careful while kneading it. Consequently, this mitzva to guard the dough cannot be referring to the kneading stage. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As Rav Huna said: </span>In the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">dough </span>prepared <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by gentiles, </span>if one knows that it has not become leavened, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a person </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fill his stomach</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> with them </span>on Passover night, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">provided that he eats an</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> olive-bulk of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in the end</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> to fulfill the obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>. The Gemara infers from this statement: With regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> that he eats <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the end, yes, </span>he fulfills his obligation with this <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>. But with regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> he ate <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the beginning, no, </span>he does not fulfill the mitzva with dough prepared by gentiles.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the reason </span>that one cannot fulfill his obligation to eat <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span> with dough prepared by gentiles? It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because </span>he <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did not perform </span>his duty to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guard </span>this dough. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But one </span>can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">perform </span>his duty to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guard </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it from </span>the time of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">baking and onward. Rather, isn’</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">t it </span>correct to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">conclude from </span>this <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>the grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">must </span>be guarded <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from the beginning, </span>i.e., from the time it is soaked, which proves that soaking the grain is part of the process of preparing <span class=\"it-text\">matza</span>?", 
            "The Gemara rejects this: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And from where </span>do we know that this conclusion is correct? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Perhaps it is different </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there, as at the time when guarding is required, </span>i.e., when water was added to the flour, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he did</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not perform </span>his duty to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guard it </span>properly. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>in a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where at the time when guarding is required</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>when water is added the flour, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he </span>properly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">performed </span>his duty to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guard it, so too, </span>it is possible that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guarding </span>flour at the time <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of kneading is </span>considered proper <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guarding. </span>Therefore, this question cannot be resolved based on the case of dough prepared by gentiles.

            "After discussing leaven in a mixture, the Gemara states a more general principle. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: With regard to all prohibitions of the Torah, a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> permitted </span>substance <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does not join together with a prohibited </span>substance. If one eats a permitted food with a prohibited food, and together they constitute the minimum prohibited measure, he is exempt from punishment for this act of consumption. This principle applies to all <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">except for the prohibitions of a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> nazirite, </span>who is liable for eating a mixture of that kind, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as the Torah said </span>with regard to a nazirite: “He shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink anything <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">soaked </span>in grapes” (Numbers 6:3). This verse indicates that a nazirite is prohibited from consuming not only wine and vinegar, but also any food that was soaked in these liquids. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Ze’eiri said: </span>Permitted and prohibited substances <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">also </span>combine with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the prohibition against</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> offering leaven </span>on the altar, as it states: “For no [<span class=\"it-text\">kol </span>] leaven and no [<span class=\"it-text\">kol </span>] honey shall be offered as a burnt-offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11).

            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yes, indeed it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is so, and </span>the prohibition mentioned by Ze’eiri against sacrificing leaven in offerings was only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to exclude </span>the statement <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Abaye, who said: There is </span>significance to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering less </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">than an olive-bulk </span>of leaven on the altar, and one is flogged for sacrificing an offering of that kind.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the Rabbis, </span>as they maintain that the principle that the legal status of the taste of a prohibited substance is like that of the substance itself is not limited to these two cases, they would <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say to you </span>that both sources <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">necessary. </span>The case of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sin-offering </span>is necessary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to</span> derive the principle <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that a permitted </span>substance <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">joins together with</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a prohibited </span>substance, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one cannot derive </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">non-sacred </span>food <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from consecrated </span>property. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the term <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">soaked, </span>which appears in the context of the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of a nazirite, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches </span>the principle that the legal status of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taste is like </span>that of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">substance. </span>Since both examples are necessary, they are not considered two verses that come as one, and it is therefore possible to derive a principle from them. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>consequently, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from here you derive </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to all of the Torah in its </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">entirety. </span>",

            "As the mishna discusses the requirement to observe local customs, the Gemara relates: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The residents of Beit She’an were accustomed not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to travel from Tyre to </span>market day in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Sido</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">n</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Shabbat eve. </span>In deference to Shabbat, they adopted a stringency and would not interrupt their Shabbat preparations even for a short sea voyage. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Their children came before Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>to request that he repeal this custom. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They said to him</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: </span>Due to their wealth, it was possible for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">our fathers</span> to earn a living without traveling to the market on Friday; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">however, it is not possible for u</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span> to do so. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He said to them: Your fathers already accepted </span>this virtuous custom <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">upon themselves</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> and it remains in effect for you, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is stated: “My son, hear </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">your father’s rebuke and do not abandon your mother’</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s teaching” </span>(Proverbs 1:8). In addition to adhering to one’s father’s rebuke, i.e., <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, one is also required to preserve his mother’s teaching, i.e., ancestral customs. ", 
            "The Gemara relates additional customs: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The residents </span>of the city of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ḥoza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">i</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> were accustomed to separate </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥalla</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from rice </span>dough. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They came and told Rav Yosef </span>about this custom. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said to them: Let a non-priest eat </span>this dough <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in their presence </span>to show them unequivocally that this custom has no legal basis. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Abaye raised an objection to him</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matters </span>that are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted, but others </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were accustomed to </span>treat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">them </span>as a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prohibition</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> "

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, Rav Ashi said: We see, if the majority</span> of people in that place <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat rice, </span>do <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not let</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a non-priest eat </span><span class=\"it-text\">ḥalla</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in their presence, lest the</span> halakhic <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">category </span>of <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥalla</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be forgotten from them.

            "After mentioning <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> relating to customs, the Gemara returns to discuss the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matter itself. </span>If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matters </span>are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitte</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> but others</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> were accustomed to </span>treat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">them </span>as a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prohibition, you are</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not allowed to permit </span>these actions in their presence. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ḥisda said: We are dealing with Samaritans, </span>not with Jews. The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And doesn’t </span>this apply <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to everyone? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> to the contrary? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Two brothers may bathe together</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> and there is no concern that doing so is immodest or will lead to sinful thoughts. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>the custom was that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two brothers do not bathe together in </span>the city of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Kabul </span>(see I Kings 9:13). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>there was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an incident involving Yehuda and Hillel</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> sons of Rabban</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Gamliel, who bathed together in Kabul, and the entire city</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> denounced them </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: In all our days we have</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> never seen that </span>type of conduct. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Hillel stole </span>away <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> went out to the outer chamber and did not want</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to tell them: You are permitted </span>to do so. He preferred to obey the city residents rather than rule it permitted for two brothers to bathe together. ", 
            "Similarly, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">go out with wide </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shoe</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span> that resemble slippers <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on Shabbat; however, one does not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> go out with wide shoes </span>in the city of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Birei</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. And </span>there was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an incident involving Yehuda and Hillel, sons</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of Rabban Gamliel, who went out with wide shoes in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Birei, and the </span>people of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">city denounced them and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: In all our days we have never seen that</span> type of conduct. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>Yehuda and Hillel <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">removed </span>their shoes, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and gave them to their </span>gentile <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">servants</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> did not want to tell </span>the residents of the city: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">You are permitted </span>to go out with wide shoes on Shabbat.", 
            "Similarly, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one may sit on gentiles’ stool</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> on Shabbat, </span>even though these stools are typically used for displaying merchandise. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>there was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an incident involving Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sat on gentiles’ stools in </span>the city of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Akko, and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the entire city denounced him.

Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">moved onto the ground and did not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> want to tell them: You are permitted </span>to sit on the stools. The Gemara answers: The legal status of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">people in the cities</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> since Sages are not found </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">among them, is like </span>that of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Samaritans. </span>Therefore, it is prohibited to tell them that these activities are permitted. ", 
            "The Gemara proceeds to clarify the reasons for the stringent customs in those communities. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Granted, </span>sitting on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">gentiles’ stools </span>is prohibited <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because it appears like </span>one is engaged <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in buying and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> selling </span>on Shabbat. In the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">wide shoes as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> well, </span>the Sages prohibited wearing them due to the concern <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lest they fall off </span>one’s feet <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and he come</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to carry them </span>in his hand <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">four cubits in the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> public domain, </span>thereby violating a Torah prohibition. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, what is the reason that </span>two brothers <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not bathe </span>together? The Gemara answers: The custom to prohibit doing so is based on that which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was taught</span> in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A person </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bathe with anyone except</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for his father, and his father-in-law, and his</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> mother’s husband, and his sister’s husband. </span>Due to the nature of their relation, one might come to ponder how they came to be related and have prohibited thoughts about intimacy between men and women. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permits </span>one to bathe <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with his father, due to the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">honor </span>that he can accord <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his father </span>by assisting his father while bathing. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The same is true for one’s </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">mother’s husband. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the people of Kabul <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">came and issued a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">decree </span>to prohibit bathing together <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for two brothers, due to </span>their concern that it is similar to bathing with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one’</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s sister’s husband. It was taught </span>in the <span class=\"it-text\">Tosefta</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A student may not bathe with his teacher</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> since it is disrespectful to see one’s teacher naked. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if his teacher requires his </span>help when bathing, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted.</span>", 
            "The Gemara relates: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When Rabba bar bar Ḥan</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he ate </span>the fat found <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">over the straight </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">part </span>of an animal’s stomach. The fat along the stomach consists of two parts: The inner, straight portion, which is shaped like a bowstring, and the outer, rounded portion, which is shaped like a bow. With regard to the fat surrounding the inner, straight portion, the custom in Eretz Yisrael was lenient, whereas in Babylonia it was stringent. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Avira the Elder and Rabba, son </span>of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Huna, entered </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>see Rabba bar bar Ḥana. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When he saw them</span> coming, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he concealed from them </span>what he was eating. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They came and told Abaye </span>what had happened, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to them: </span>Through his conduct, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he rendered you Samaritans, </span>as he could have told you that it is permitted but did not do so.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And is Rabba bar bar Ḥana</span>, who was lenient with regard to a matter that is prohibited, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>in agreement with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that which we learned </span>in the mishna: When one travels from one place to another, the Sages <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impose </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">upon him the stringencies of the place from which he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">left and the stringencies of the place to which he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">went? Abaye said: That applies </span>when one travels <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>one place <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in Babylonia to </span>another place <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in Babylonia, or from </span>one place <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in Eretz Yisrael to </span>another place <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in Eretz </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yisrael, or alternatively, from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Shimi of Neharde</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">’a strongly objects to this: Do the Rabbis disagree with</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Rabbi Yosei with regard to </span>the fruits <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of all other</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> trees </span>besides grapes, that even in the very first stage of ripening, they are considered fruit? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Didn’t we learn</span> in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From when may one no </span>longer <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">chop</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> down trees during the Sabbatical </span>Year, as he thereby damages the fruit? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Shammai say: </span>In the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all the trees, from when </span>the blossoms fall and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fruit</span> begins to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">emerge </span>in its earliest stage. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Beit Hillel</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> say: </span>There is a distinction between different types of trees. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The carob trees </span>may not be chopped down <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from when</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> they </span>form <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">chains </span>of carobs; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and the vines, </span>"

        [
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when </span>the grapes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">form kernels </span>and grow slightly; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">olive </span>trees, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from when they blossom; and all other trees</span> may not be chopped down <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from when they produce </span>fruit. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rav Asi said: It is an unripe grape, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is a grape kernel, it is a white bean, </span>i.e., their legal status is the same. Before this is explained, the Gemara expresses astonishment: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Does it enter your </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">mind </span>that the grape is at any stage <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a white </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bean? Rather, say: </span>The <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">size </span>of an unripe grape is equivalent to the size <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of a white bean. </span>", 
            "In any case, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">whom did you hear that said: An unripe grape</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, yes, </span>is considered fruit, while <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a grape bud, no, </span>it is not considered fruit?

This indicates that unripe dates have the same status as ordinary dates. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>the Gemara retracts its previous answer and explains that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Elai chopped </span>down a palm tree <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with stunted dates</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> which never ripen on the tree. It was permitted to chop down the tree because the dates can be ripened only after they are removed from the tree.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Sages taught: One </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat grape</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span> during the Sabbatical Year <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">until the </span>grapes on the vine <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">branches in </span>the place called <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Okhel have ceased.

            "Similarly, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one may </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat olives until the final </span>olives <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">have ceased </span>on the trees <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in Tekoa.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises a contradiction </span>from that which was taught in a different <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">One may eat</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from the grapes until Passover; from the olives, until </span>the festival of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Assembly, </span>i.e., <span class=\"it-text\">Shavuot</span>; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from the dried</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> figs, until Hanukkah; and from the dates, until Purim. And</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Rav Beivai said: Rabbi Yoḥanan transposes the last two. </span>According to his version of the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, one may eat dried figs until Purim and dates until Hanukkah. This is inconsistent with the previous statement that dates may be eaten until those in Tzoar have ceased. The Gemara resolves this contradiction: Both <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>time <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and that </span>time <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are one period. </span>The first Sage designated the deadline in terms of the place where dates grow, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel designated the deadline in terms of the dates. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you wish</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, say </span>instead that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is taught explicitly: And if there</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> are </span>fruits elsewhere <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">later than those, one may </span>continue <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eating on their </span>basis. This indicates that the places and the times mentioned are merely indicators, but that the prohibition depends on actual conditions in the field. ", 
            "The Gemara continues: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>A good <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sign for mountains </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">gallnut </span>oaks, used in the preparation of ink, grow there. A good <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sign for valleys is palm </span>trees. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A </span>good <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sign for streams is reeds. </span>A good <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sign for the plain is a sycamore </span>tree. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although there is no proof </span>for these indicators, there is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an allusion to the matter </span>in the verse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is stated: “And the king made silver to be in </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Jerusalem like stones, and he made cedars to be as </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the sycamore trees in the plain” </span>(I Kings 10:27). ", 
            "The Gemara elaborates on this <span class=\"it-text\">Tosefta</span>: A good <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sign for mountains</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is gallnut </span>oaks, a good <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sign for valleys is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">palm </span>trees. What purpose is served by these signs? The <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">practical difference </span>of these signs pertains to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first fruits</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">One may bring first fruits only from the seven specie</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span> and only from the highest quality fruit. Therefore, one may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>bring first fruits <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from palm trees that </span>grow <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the mountains. </span>Since the mountains are not a suitable location for palm trees, the dates grown there are inferior. Similarly, one does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>bring first fruits <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from fruits that </span>grow on palm trees <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the valleys, </span>because mountain fruits do not grow there properly. ", 
            "A good <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sign for streams is reeds. </span>The case where this sign makes a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">practical </span>halakhic <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">difference </span>is with regard <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">rough </span>dried-up <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">stream </span>mentioned in the Torah. When a corpse is found between two towns and the murderer cannot be identified, the Torah states that a calf’s neck is broken in a rough stream. The <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> teaches that growing reeds identify the spot as a stream. A good <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sign for the plain is a sycamore </span>tree. The Gemara explains that the case where this sign makes a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">practical</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> difference </span>is with regard <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to buying and selling. </span>If one stipulates that he is buying land in the plains, it is defined as an area where sycamore trees grow. The Gemara notes: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Now that you have arrived at this </span>practical halakhic difference with regard <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>assessing the quality of land for the purpose of transactions, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all </span>the signs can be understood as pertaining <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to buying and selling as well, </span>to identify valleys and mountainous regions.", 
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Apropos different local customs discussed in the first mishna in this chapter, this mishna discusses various <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> with regard to which there are different customs. In <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a place where </span>the people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were accustomed to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sell small livestock to gentiles, one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sell </span>them. In <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a place where </span>the people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were not accustomed to sell </span>them due to certain concerns and decrees, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sell </span>them. However, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in every place, one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sell </span>to gentiles <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">neither large </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">livestock</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> e.g., cows and camels, nor <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">calves or </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">foals</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> whether these animals are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">whole</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> or damaged. </span>The Sages prohibited those sales due to the concern lest the transaction be voided or one side reconsider, creating retroactively a situation where a Jew’s animal performed labor for the gentile on Shabbat in violation of an explicit Torah prohibition. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda permits </span>the sale of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> damaged </span>animal because it is incapable of performing labor. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ben</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Beteira permits </span>the sale of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hors</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span> for riding, because riding a horse on Shabbat is not prohibited by Torah law.

            "The mishna cites another custom related to Passover.

In that case, it is clear that one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is saying</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that </span>the flour <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be watched for Passover. </span>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">meat </span>is that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>the case? Is it really prohibited to say that meat is for Passover? The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection. Rabbi Yosei said: Theodosius [</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Todos</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of Rome, </span>leader of the Jewish community there, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">instituted the custom for the Roman </span>Jews <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to eat </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">kids roasted [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">mekulas</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> whole </span>with their entrails over their heads <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the evenings of Passover, </span>as was the custom in the Temple. The Sages <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sent </span>a message <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to him</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: If you were not Theodosius, </span>an important person, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">I would</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> have decreed ostracism upon you, as </span>it appears as if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you are feeding Israel consecrated food, </span>which may be eaten only in and around the Temple itself, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">outside </span>the permitted area. The Gemara asks about the terminology used here: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Could</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it enter your mind </span>that this meat was actually <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">consecrated</span> meat? That was certainly not the case. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, say </span>instead: "

        [
            "Doing so <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is akin to feeding Jews </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">consecrated </span>meat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">outside </span>the permitted area, as due to its resemblance to the Paschal lamb it could be misleading. The Gemara analyzes this statement: A goat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted whole, yes, </span>it is prohibited; a goat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not roasted whole, no, </span>it is not prohibited. This contradicts Rav, who prohibited roasting even ordinary meat. The Sages <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>that this is the distinction: With regard to a goat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted whole, there is no </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">difference </span>if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one said </span>it is for Passover, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is no difference </span>if one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did not say </span>it is for Passover.

With regard to a goat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted whole, </span>if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one specified </span>that it is for Passover, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">yes, </span>it is prohibited because it appears that he is consecrating it as a sacrifice. However, if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one did not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">specify</span> that it is for Passover, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">no, </span>it is not prohibited, as there is no need for concern.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Aḥa teaches this </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">baraita</span> about Theodosius <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon. </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Sheshet strongly objected to this: Granted, </span>according <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one who learns it in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei, </span>it works out <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">well.

Didn’t </span>we <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">learn </span>in a mishna about a dispute with regard to one who consecrated an item for a purpose for which it was unsuited, e.g., a case where one sought to bring a meal-offering of barley, although meal-offerings may be brought only from wheat? In that case, the Rabbis say he is required to bring a meal-offering of wheat because in the first part of his statement he vowed to bring a meal-offering. ",

Since no meal-offering of that kind exists, one is not required to bring an offering at all. Similarly, with regard to Passover, since one can consecrate only a living animal as a sacrifice and cannot consecrate meat as a sacrifice, if one declares: This meat is for Passover, it is in no way similar to consecrating an animal, and the meat has no sanctity.

According to Rabbi Meir, one is held accountable for the beginning of his statement. Since he mentioned the burnt-offering first, the animal assumes the status of a burnt-offering. However, Rabbi Yosei says that the one’s entire statement is significant, and that the animal is consecrated for two sacrifices. The owner must wait until the animal becomes blemished, redeem it, and use the money to purchase a burnt-offering and a peace-offering. Rabbi Shimon holds in accordance with Rabbi Yosei’s opinion concerning a barley meal-offering. He maintains that one is held accountable not only for his first expression, i.e., that it is a meal-offering, but also for his second expression, i.e., that it is of barley. In that case, the second part of his statement negates the first part. ",

Those who said that one kindles a lamp believe that because people do not engage in relations while a lamp is lit, the lamp will discourage intimacy.

", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And does Rabbi Yehuda hold that performance of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">labor on the fourteenth is permitted </span>everywhere other than the Galilee? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one who is weeding </span>a field on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the thirteenth </span>of Nisan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>a stalk of grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was uprooted in his hand, he plants it in </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a muddy place </span>so that it will take root before the <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> offering is brought on the sixteenth of Nisan?

However, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not plant</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it in a dry place, </span>as it will not take root there immediately. If it begins to sprout only after the <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> offering is brought, that grain will remain prohibited until after the following year’s <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> offering is brought.

            "From Rabbi Yehuda’s statement it can be inferred that if a person was weeding <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the thirteenth </span>of Nisan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">yes, </span>this is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>; however, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the fourteenth </span>of Nisan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">no, </span>one may not replant the stalk of grain. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Now, we learned </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda said: Any graft that does not take </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hold in three days will no longer take hold. If </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it could enter your mind </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">performing labor on the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fourteenth is permitted, why </span>do <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">I </span>need this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> to be taught specifically with regard to the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">thirteenth? </span>It would have been a greater novelty had he taught the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to a case that occurs on the fourteenth. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Aren’t there </span>three days remaining for grain planted on the fourteenth to take root before the <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> offering, i.e., <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the fourteenth </span>of Nisan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the fifteenth </span>of Nisan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> part of the sixteenth </span>of Nisan? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said: They </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught </span>this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> of replanting a stalk of wheat with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Galilee; </span>as mentioned in the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, Rabbi Yehuda says that in the Galilee they do not perform labor at all.

Rabbi Yehuda could have taught the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to weeding on the night before the fourteenth. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Sheshet said: </span>Rabbi Yehuda said this <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Shammai,</span> who prohibit performing labor that night. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ashi said: </span>There is no reason to suggest implausibly that Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, contrary to the accepted <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Actually, </span>Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Beit Hillel. </span>However, he did not teach the case about the night before the fourteenth of Nisan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because it is not the </span>typical <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">manner of people</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to weed at night. </span>It is virtually impossible to identify weeds in the dark.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From where are these matters </span>derived, i.e., that the daily afternoon offering is sacrificed between eight and a half hours of the day and nine and a half hours? ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: </span>As <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse </span>concerning the daily offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">says: “The one lamb you shall offer in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the morning and the second lamb you shall offer in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the afternoon [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">bein</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ha’arbayim</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]” </span>(Numbers 28:4). He understands this as follows: The term for afternoon in the verse is a Hebrew phrase, the literal meaning of which is “between [<span class=\"it-text\">bein</span>] the evenings [<span class=\"it-text\">arbayim</span>].” In this context, it is referring to the period lasting from when the day begins progressing toward the evening, just after midday, until sunset. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Divide </span>this period <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">between two evenings</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span>How? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Two and a half</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> hours here </span>constitute one evening, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and two and a half</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> hours there </span>constitute another evening, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>there is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hour </span>in between <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to perform </span>the ritual of sacrificing the daily offering. Consequently, the time of the daily offering must be during the hour that begins two and a half hours after midday and ends two and a half hours before sunset. That is the time determined in the mishna.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava raised an objection: </span>We learned in our mishna that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the eves of Passover </span>the daily offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is slaughtered at seven and a half </span>hours <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and sacrificed at eight and a half </span>hours, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">both during</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the week and on Shabbat. And if it could enter</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> your mind </span>to say <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>the daily offering must be slaughtered at <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eight and a half hours by Torah law</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, how can we do it earlier </span>merely for convenience?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s source is rejected, and instead <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: The mitzva of the daily offering </span>is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from when</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the </span>sun begins to descend westward so that the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">evening</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> shadows slant </span>eastward, shortly after midday. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> reason </span>for this? It is because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">In the afternoon [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">bein</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ha’arbayim</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">], </span>which we understand to mean <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from the time that the sun begins to </span>descend <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">westward [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ma’arav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">].</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Therefore, on the rest of the days of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the year, when there are </span>many voluntary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">vow </span>offerings <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">free-will </span>offerings that must be sacrificed, these offerings are brought after the daily morning offering. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As the Merciful One says </span>with regard to the daily offering: “The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; he shall prepare the burnt-offering upon it and shall cause <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the fats of the peace-offerings </span>to go up in smoke <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">upon it” </span>(Leviticus 6:5).", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the Master said </span>that the phrase: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“The fats of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the peace-offerings upon it” </span>should be interpreted in the following manner: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Upon it,” </span>i.e., after this daily morning burnt-offering; only then should the priest <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">complete all</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the </span>other<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> offerings. </span>This teaches that all the other offerings must be sacrificed after the daily morning offering and prior to the daily afternoon offering. Since many offerings must be sacrificed prior to the daily afternoon offering, rather than sacrificing the latter at six and a half hours, as soon as it is permitted to do so, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we postpone </span>the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for two hours, and sacrifice </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it at eight and a half </span>hours of the day.", 
            "On the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eves </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Passover, </span>on the other hand, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when there is the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Paschal lamb </span>that must be brought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after </span>the daily afternoon offering, and sufficient time must be left for the slaughter of the numerous Paschal lambs, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we advance </span>the daily afternoon offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one hour and sacrifice it at seven and a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">half </span>hours. When <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Passover eve occurs on Shabbat eve, when </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there is also the roasting </span>of the Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does not override </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shabbat </span>prohibitions and therefore must be completed before Shabbat, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we establish </span>its sacrifice at the earliest time that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">halakha</span> allows, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at six and a half</span> hours.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Sages taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: With regard to the daily offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">like its arrangement during the week, so is its</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> arrangement on Shabbat; </span>this is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.

            "The Gemara seeks to clarify: According to this explanation, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with regard to what </span>principle <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do </span>these <span class=\"it-text\">tanna’im</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disagree? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> disagree about </span>whether or not <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the additional offerings </span>of Shabbat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">precede the bowls </span>of frankincense. On Shabbat, in addition to the regular daily rite, additional Shabbat offerings were sacrificed, and the frankincense that had been placed in bowls on the showbread the previous Shabbat and remained there throughout the week was burned on the altar. The dispute is as follows: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yishmael holds that the additional offerings precede the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> bowls. </span>Therefore, the priest <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sacrificed the additional offerings at </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">six </span>hours, as everyone agrees that the time to sacrifice the additional offerings is at six hours; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>he offered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the bowls at seven </span>hours; and then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he sacrificed the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">daily offering at seven and a half </span>hours. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Akiva </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">holds </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the bowls precede the additional offerings. </span>Therefore, the priest offered the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bowls at five </span>hours, sacrificed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">additional offerings at six </span>hours, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and sacrificed the daily offering</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> at six and a half </span>hours.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If that is so, </span>that the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> that the Paschal lamb is offered after the daily afternoon offering is derived from these verses, then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span>burning of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">incense and the </span>lighting of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lamps </span>of the candelabrum <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">should also precede the </span>offering of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Paschal lamb.

", 
            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is different there, </span>in the case of lamps, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as the Merciful One </span>explicitly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">excludes </span>in the Torah the possibility that the lamps will be kindled first by means of the word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">oto</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">], </span>which emphasizes that the lamps are kindled later. The Gemara clarifies: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> concerning the verse pertaining to the lamps: “In the tent of meeting, outside of the veil, which is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall set it in order <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from evening to morning </span>before the Lord; it shall be a statute forever to their generations on behalf of the children of Israel” (Exodus 27:21). The phrase <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“from evening</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to morning” </span>indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you shall allocate </span>the candelabrum <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its measur</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span> of oil, so that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it will burn from</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> evening until morning. </span>", 
            "The <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> continues: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Alternatively</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>the same verse can be interpreted as follows: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">There is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> no rite that is valid from evening until morning but</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> this one alone, </span>since all the other rites are performed only during the day. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the reason </span>that this verse is interpreted to mean that lighting the lamps is the only rite valid from evening until morning? It is because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse said </span>with regard to the candelabrum: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Aaron</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and his sons shall set [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ya’arokh</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] it [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">oto</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> order, </span>to burn <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from evening to morning.” </span>The verse uses the separate word it [<span class=\"it-text\">oto</span>], rather than a pronominal suffix attached to the word <span class=\"it-text\">ya’arokh</span> to form the word <span class=\"it-text\">ya’arkhenu</span>, in order to emphasize that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it, </span>the lighting of the candelabrum, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is from evening until morning, but no</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> other </span>rite is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from evening until morning.</span>", 
            "And the Torah <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">juxtaposes the </span>burning of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">incense to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the </span>kindling of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lamps, </span>as it explicitly states that the incense is burned at the time the lamps are kindled: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense” (Exodus 30:8). From this it is derived that no other rite is performed in the Temple after burning the incense and lighting the lamps, not even the Paschal lamb. ", 
            "That explains the opinion cited in the previous <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> and its sources. It should, however, be noted that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it was </span>explicitly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with our difficulty </span>and contrary to the opinion cited in the previous <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">daily </span>afternoon <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering precedes </span>the afternoon burning of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the incense</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> the burning of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the incense precedes </span>the lighting of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the lamps, and </span>the lighting of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the lamps precedes the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Paschal lamb. </span>This is proof that this is the correct order: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">An item, </span>the Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">about which it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is stated “in the evening” and “in the afternoon” should</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be delayed until after an item, </span>i.e., the incense and lamps, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">about which it is stated only “in the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> afternoon.” </span>", 
            "The Gemara asks: As already stated, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">isn’t “it” written </span>in the verse, from which it is derived that lighting the lamps is the final Temple rite of the day? The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This </span>word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“it” is necessary, </span>in order <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to exclude</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a rite that is </span>performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">inside </span>the sanctuary, as opposed to the Paschal lamb, which is sacrificed outside, in the courtyard. The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And what is </span>this rite? The Gemara answers: The burning of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">incense. It could have</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> entered your mind to say that since it is written</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> shall burn it” </span>(Exodus 30:8), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>that perhaps <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">should light the lamps first and then we should burn </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the incense, </span>as the verse does not clearly state which of the two comes first. Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Merciful One excludes </span>this possibility by use of the word “<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it,” </span>from which it is derived that no other rite is performed inside the sanctuary after the lamps are kindled.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>if that is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">why do I </span>need the phrase <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“in the afternoon he shall burn it,” </span>which seems to add nothing? The Gemara answers that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this is </span>what <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Merciful One is saying: </span>This verse does not come to establish the time for lighting the lamps; it comes to teach that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at the time when you light the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lamps, the incense should </span>already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be burning. </span>",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He said to him: Since it is impossible</span> to complete the offering any other way, due to the positive <span class=\"it-text\">mitzva</span> of completion, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they rendered </span>these sacrificial parts <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> ones that became ritually impure or were lost. </span>In those cases, it is permitted for priests to eat their portions. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: I <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if the sacrificial parts became ritually impure </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">or were lost, the priests would not be entitled to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the breast and thigh, </span>the eating of which ordinarily depends upon burning the sacrificial parts on the altar.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Kahana raised</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a contradiction: It is written </span>in one verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Neither </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may the fat of My festive-offering remain overnight until </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">morning” </span>(Exodus 23:18), which indicates <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>the fat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> remain overnight </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">into the morning </span>hours, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may remain all through the night. </span>However, in another verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written: “And he shall burn upon it the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> fat of the peace-offerings” </span>(Leviticus 6:5), and it is interpreted: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Upon it you shall complete all the offerings,</span> which indicates that the fats of all the offerings brought during the day must be burned before the daily afternoon offering.", 
            "Rav Kahana <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raised the objection and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> he resolved it: </span>The verse which indicates that the fat may remain all through the night is referring to fats that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were left over </span>after the blood was sprinkled during the day, after the daily morning offering, and there was no opportunity to offer them on the altar before the daily afternoon offering. Although ideally they should be offered on the altar before the daily afternoon offering, if they were left over, they may be offered until morning. ", 
            "Similarly, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Safra raised a contradiction before Rav: </span>In one verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written: “Neither shall the sacrifice of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">feast of Passover be left over until morning” </span>(Exodus 34:25), from which it can be inferred that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it may not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> remain overnight </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">into the morning </span>hours, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may remain all through the night. </span>Accordingly, the fats of a Paschal lamb that was slaughtered on a weekday Passover eve may be offered on the altar on the night of the Festival. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, </span>elsewhere <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written: “The </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">burnt-offering of each Shabbat on its own Shabbat </span>in addition to the continual burnt-offering and its libation” (Numbers 28:10), from which it is derived that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the burnt-offering </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of a weekday is not offered on Shabbat, and the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">burnt-offering of a weekday is not offered on a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Festival. </span>Therefore, it should be prohibited to burn the fats of the Paschal lamb on the altar on the Festival, as it is a weekday offering and consequently may not be offered on a Festival. ", 
            "Rav <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: Rav Abba bar Ḥiyya already raised </span>this <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">contradiction before Rabbi Abbahu, and he answered him: Here, </span>in the verse that says that the fat may not remain overnight and into the morning hours but it may remain on the altar all through the night, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we are dealing</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> with </span>a case where <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the fourteenth </span>of Nisan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">occurs on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Shabbat, as the fats of a Shabbat </span>offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may be</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> sacrificed </span>on the altar <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on a Festival</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> It is only in that specific case that the fats of the Paschal lamb may be burned on the night of the Festival.",

Rabbi Yosei says that not only the beginning but also the conclusion of his statement is significant, and the animal has been consecrated as both a burnt-offering and a peace-offering. It is therefore unfit to be offered on the altar; rather, it must be sold when it develops a defect and the money used to purchase animals for both a burnt-offering and a peace-offering. And similarly in the case of our mishna, where the priest says that his intent is for the purpose of a Paschal lamb and for the purpose of a peace-offering, Rabbi Yosei would say that the animal has been slaughtered for both a Paschal lamb and a peace-offering, and is therefore disqualified.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">For if </span>our mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Meir, </span>surely <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he said: Hold </span>one accountable for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the first expression, </span>and what he says after that is of no consequence. Rabbi Meir disagrees with Rabbi Yosei about the case of one who says: This animal is a burnt-offering and a peace-offering, for he maintains that the sacrifice has the status of a burnt-offering. Since the first term that he uttered was burnt-offering, the animal is consecrated as a burnt-offering, and it can no longer become a peace-offering.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When Rav Dimi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> cam</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he said: I </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raised this question in the presence of Rabbi Yirmeya </span>and expressed my opinion: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since </span>intent to offer the sacrifice <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its own purpose validates it at its proper time, </span>i.e., on the eve of Passover, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>intent to offer the sacrifice <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for a different purpose validates it not at</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> its proper time, </span>i.e., the rest of the year, there is room to equate the two situations. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Just </span>as intent <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its own purpose, which validates it at its</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> proper time, does not nullify </span>the intent to offer the sacrifice <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for a different purpose, </span>i.e., if one intends to offer the sacrifice both for its own purpose and for a different purpose it is disqualified, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so too, </span>intent to offer the sacrifice <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for a different purpose, which </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">validates it not at its proper time, does not nullify </span>the intent to offer the sacrifice <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its own purpose, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it is disqualified. </span>It can be concluded from here that whenever one’s thoughts concerning an offering are a combination of validating and disqualifying intentions, the offering is disqualified.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>Rabbi Yirmeya <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to me: No, </span>this reasoning is not to be relied upon. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If you say </span>this rule concerning the intent to offer a Paschal lamb applies when it is sacrificed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for a different purpose, </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because </span>this disqualification <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">applies to all offerings, </span>as slaughtering an offering for a purpose other than its own disqualifies all offerings to one extent or another. Therefore, intent for the sacrifice’s own purpose does not nullify intent for a different purpose.

            "Rav Dimi’s argument having been refuted, the Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What </span>conclusion was reached <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">about </span>Rav Dimi’s question? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said: A Paschal lamb</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that one slaughtered on the rest of the days of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the year </span>with the intent that it be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> own purpose and for a different purpose is valid. </span>The reason for this is as follows: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">In an </span>otherwise <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">undetermined </span>situation, the animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">stands </span>to be offered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">own purpose, </span>for one did not rescind its status as a Paschal lamb either verbally or by intent. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But nevertheless, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when he slaughters it for a different purpose, it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">valid.</span>",

The proof of this is that if one slaughtered the Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for those who can eat it and those </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who cannot eat it, it is valid, but wherever he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughters it only for the sake of those who cannot </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat it, it is disqualified.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let us see to which it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is similar, </span>i.e., which comparison seems more reasonable: Do <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we derive a matter, </span>namely, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to uncircumcised males, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that does not apply to all offerings</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, from </span>another <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matter, </span>namely, the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to the ritually impure, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that does not apply to all offerings, </span>as when it comes to other offerings, one who is ritually impure may send his offering with a proxy and thereby achieve atonement? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to intent to eat the offering beyond the allotted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, which applies </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to all </span>other <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offerings, should not </span>be used to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prove </span>anything about our case.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Or, </span>perhaps, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">go this way: We </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">derive a matter, </span>namely, the law with regard to uncircumcised males, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for which no allowance </span>is made <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from its rule</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from a matter, </span>namely improper intent with regard to the time, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for which no allowance </span>is made <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from its </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">rule, </span>as there are no exceptions for either of these two disqualifications. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the law with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">should not </span>be used to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prove </span>anything, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span>there are circumstances in which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an allowance </span>is made <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from its rule. </span>Under certain circumstances it is permitted to offer the Paschal lamb while ritually impure, such as when the entire Jewish people is ritually impure.

            "In order to resolve this issue, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: “This,” </span>as it says: “And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the ordinance of the Passover: No stranger shall eat of it; but every man’s servant that is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it” (Exodus 12:43–44). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What </span>is implied from the emphasis of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“this”?

The amplification indicated by the word all teaches that the offering is invalidated only if all members of the group are uncircumcised.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, is this not what it is teaching</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: The verse states: “And all uncircumcised </span>males,” to teach that only if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all </span>members of the group are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">uncircumcised is</span> the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disqualified, </span>but if only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">part </span>of the group is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">uncircumcised it is not disqualified.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you say: What </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is the leniency of sprinkling </span>such that this intent for a group whose members are all uncircumcised disqualifies the offering only during the slaughter but not during the sprinkling?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rav Ḥisda </span>is of the opinion that, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the contrary, </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> should be understood <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the opposite direction.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you say: What </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is the stringency of sprinkling </span>such that part of the group being uncircumcised disqualifies the offering during the sprinkling, but not during slaughter? The answer is that <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">piggul</span> status <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">established only during sprinkling</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> The status of <span class=\"it-text\">piggul</span> applies to an offering when one performs at least one of the rites with the intent that the offering be consumed outside the allotted time, but only if no rite was performed with some other invalid intent, such as intending that the offering be eaten outside its designated place. This can only be confirmed at the time of the sprinkling, which is the last of the four essential rites. Consequently, sprinkling is the rite most likely to disqualify an offering due to improper intent.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ashi strongly objects to this </span>method of interpretation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From where </span>do you derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that this </span>expression <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> all uncircumcised </span>males” <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">means that all </span>the members of the group are uncircumcised? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Perhaps this </span>expression <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“and all [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">kol</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] uncircumcised </span>males” <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">means that any </span>of its members <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> uncircumcised. </span>Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Merciful One says</span> in the Torah:<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> “This,” </span>to teach that the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is not disqualified unless all of it</span>s members are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">uncircumcised, </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there is no difference between slaughtering and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sprinkling. </span>Therefore, the dispute between Rabba and Rav Ḥisda must be based on some other proof text and issue. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ashi said: Rav Ḥisda and Rabba</span>"

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disagree with regard to this verse, </span>which is stated with regard to a different offering: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">him” </span>(Leviticus 1:4). It is inferred: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">For him and not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for his fellow. </span>One cannot achieve atonement through an offering that has been designated for someone else. Rabba and Rav Ḥisda disagree with regard to the halakhic conclusions that should be drawn from this law. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba holds </span>that the law applies to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">another </span>who is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">similar to him: Just as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> he is eligible for atonement </span>through the sprinkling of the blood of this offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so </span>the law applies to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">another</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> who is eligible for atonement. </span>This comes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to exclude this</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> uncircumcised person, who is not eligible for atonement. </span>Since an uncircumcised person is not fit for the Paschal lamb, slaughtering it for him does not disqualify the offering.",

Why is an uncircumcised person seen as obligated to bring the Paschal lamb? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since if he wants, he can make himself fi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">t</span> through circumcision, and the obligation will automatically apply to him. There is a way for him to include himself among those who eat the offering; therefore, he cannot categorically be considered someone who is not eligible for atonement. Consequently, slaughtering the Paschal lamb for him disqualifies the offering. ", 
            "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But does Rav Ḥisda accept </span>this argument of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since? </span>Does he maintain that one can discuss a situation that does not exist due to the possibility that the present circumstances might change? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But it was said </span>that Rabba and Rav Ḥisda disagree about this as it pertains to the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one who bakes on a Festival </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span>use <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">during the week: Rav Ḥisda said he is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">flogged </span>for having violated the Festival by baking in order to eat the food on a weekday; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba said he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is not flogged.</span>", 
            "The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba said he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is not flogged </span>for the following reason: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since if guests arrive, </span>whatever he bakes will be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fit for him </span>to use on the Festival itself, and he will not be guilty of any transgression, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">now too, </span>although guests have not yet arrived, the food is considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fit for him, and he is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not flogged. </span>At the time of the baking, the act was not unequivocally prohibited. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ḥisda said he is flogged</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">; we do not state </span>the principle of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since. </span>At first glance, there is an internal contradiction with regard to the opinions of both Rabba and Rav Ḥisda.",

            "The Gemara expresses surprise again: It turns out then that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the first clause </span>of the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity of the meat, </span>while <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the latter clause </span>relates to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity of the people. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yes, </span>and there is no difficulty, as the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">argues from the </span>general <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">category of impurity </span>without necessarily relating to the same type of impurity.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you wish, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>a different answer: The <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">entire </span><span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity of the meat, and where is it permitted </span>to eat impure sacrificial meat? It is permitted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>a case of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity of the Paschal lamb, as we learned</span> in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A Paschal lamb that comes in impurity</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>e.g., when the majority of the community is ritually impure and the offering may be brought in impurity, may also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be eaten in impurity, as from the very outset</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it came only to be eaten. </span>This is unlike the law with regard to other offerings that are brought in impurity; their blood is sprinkled on the altar, but their meat may not be eaten. Consequently, even the prohibition to consume impure sacrificial meat is permitted under certain circumstances. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Huna</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, son of Rav Yehoshua, raised an objection </span>from a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that teaches: The Paschal sacrifice may be a young lamb or goat less than one year old. In the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Paschal lamb that has passed its </span>first <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">year</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> so that it has automatically become a peace-offering, if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he slaughtered it at its </span>appointed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time </span>on Passover eve <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purpose </span>as a Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and similarly, </span>if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he slaughtered another </span>offering, e.g., a lamb that had been sanctified as a peace-offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the purpose of a Paschal lamb at its </span>set <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">tanna’im</span> disagree with regard to the status of the offering. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Eliezer disqualifies </span>the offering; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and Rabbi Yehoshua </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">validates it, </span>based on the principle that offerings brought for the purpose of other offerings are valid. The only exception is the Paschal lamb, which when brought for another purpose is invalid. According to Rabbi Yehoshua, in both of these cases the animal is not truly a Paschal lamb; rather, it is a peace-offering brought with the intent that it serve as a Paschal lamb.", 
            "The Gemara infers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The reason </span>that the sacrifice is disqualified <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>that it was brought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at its </span>proper <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time; </span>it is in this case that the <span class=\"it-text\">tanna</span><span class=\"it-text\">’im</span> disagree. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But if it was not </span>brought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at its</span> proper <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, it is valid </span>according to everyone, as it is like any other peace-offering that was slaughtered for a different purpose. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But why </span>is this so? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let us</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> say: Since </span>slaughtering another sacrifice for the purpose of a Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disqualifies </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at its </span>proper <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> this should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">also disqualify </span>it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not at its </span>proper <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time. </span>Consequently, the ruling quoted above is difficult according to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, who accepts the principle of since for the sake of stringency.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Pappa</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: It is different there </span>in the case of another sacrifice slaughtered for the purpose of a Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the verse said: “And you shall say: It is a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Passover sacrifice </span>to the Lord, Who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He smote Egypt, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and prostrated themselves” (Exodus 12:27). The word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“it” </span>indicates that the Paschal lamb must be brought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is, </span>according to its details, without any change. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It, </span>the Paschal lamb, must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>be offered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for the purpose </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of other </span>sacrifices; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and other </span>sacrifices must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>be offered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its purpose, </span>i.e., as a Paschal lamb. In both of these cases, the offering is disqualified.", 
            "It may now be inferred: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">At its </span>proper <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>on Passover eve, when the Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is disqualified </span>if it is brought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for the purpose of other </span>sacrifices, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">other</span> sacrifices <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are disqualified </span>according to Rabbi Eliezer if they are brought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its purpose, </span>i.e., as a Paschal lamb. But <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not at its </span>proper <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, </span>when a Paschal lamb offered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for the purpose of other </span>sacrifices <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is valid, other</span> sacrifices offered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its purpose </span>as a Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are</span> also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">valid. </span>Since the verse’s use of the word “it” links the disqualifications of a Paschal lamb offered as a different sacrifice and any other sacrifice offered for the purpose of a Paschal lamb, the principle of since does not apply. ", 
            "There is a fundamental problem in the mishna that was clarified during the course of a particular incident: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Simla</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">i</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> came before Rabbi Yoḥanan. He said to him</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: Would the Master teach me the Book of Genealogies</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?</span> The Book of Genealogies was a collection of tannaitic teachings that formed a midrash on the book of Chronicles.

Rabbi Simlai <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pressured </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan until <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he agreed </span>to teach him. ", 
            "Rabbi Simlai <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: Teach me </span>the Book of Genealogies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in three months. </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">took a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> clod </span>of dirt, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">threw it at him, </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to him: Berurya</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> wife of Rabbi Meir </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">daughter</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon, </span>was so sharp and had such a good memory that she <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">learned three hundred </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">halakhot</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in one day from three hundred Sages, and nonetheless she</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> did not fulfill her responsibility </span>to properly learn the Book of Genealogies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in three years </span>because it is especially long and difficult. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And you say </span>that I should teach it to you <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in three months? </span>After your inappropriate request, I am not inclined to teach you at all.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">When </span>Rabbi Simlai <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was taking leave to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> go, he said to </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even so, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">my </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teacher, </span>as I have already come, let me ask you a question: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is </span>the difference <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">between </span>one who offers a Paschal lamb both <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purpose and for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a different purpose, </span>in which case the offering is disqualified, and one who offers the sacrifice with the intent that it be both <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for those who can eat it and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for those who cannot eat it, </span>in which case the offering is not disqualified?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He said to him: Since </span>I understand from your question that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you are a Torah scholar, come and I </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">will tell you </span>the answer: When one sacrifices an offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purpose and for a different purpose, </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disqualification is in </span>the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">itself; </span>that is, the disqualifying intention relates to the sacrifice itself. In contrast, when one sacrifices an offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for those who can eat it and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for those who cannot eat it, </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disqualification is not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in </span>the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">itself, </span>as the disqualifying intent relates to the people who are to eat from it.", 
            "Furthermore, when one sacrifices an offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purpose and for</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a different purpose, it is impossible to identify its prohibition</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">; </span>that is, there is no way to differentiate between valid and invalid parts of the offering. In contrast, when one sacrifices an offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for those who can eat it and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> for those who cannot eat it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it is possible</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to identify its prohibition. </span>If some of the people may eat it and some may not, it is possible to distribute the offering to each group and thereby determine which part of the offering is invalid.", 
            "Furthermore, the intent that the offering be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> its </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purpose and for a different purpose applies </span>and can disqualify the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>all <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">four rites, </span>namely: Slaughtering, receiving the blood, carrying the blood to the altar, and sprinkling it on the altar; however, the intent that it be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for those who can eat it and for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">those who cannot eat it does not </span>apply <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">during </span>all <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">four rites, </span>as it has no effect during the time of the sprinkling. Moreover, the intent that the offering be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for its </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purpose and for a different purpose </span>is a disqualification <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that applies to communal </span>sacrifices <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span>it does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to individual </span>sacrifices; in contrast, the intent that it be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for those who can eat it and those who cannot </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat it does not </span>apply <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to the community as </span>it does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to an individual.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ashi said </span>that careful analysis of these answers demonstrates the following: The argument that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its disqualification is in </span>the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">itself and </span>the argument that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is impossible to identify its prohibition are </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>and the same <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">thing; </span>they are not two separate reasons. As, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what is the reason that </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">says </span>that when one brings an offering for a different purpose, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its disqualification is in </span>the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">itself? </span>It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is impossible to identify its prohibition, </span>and therefore the prohibition applies to the offering itself.

            "Having mentioned the Book of Genealogies, the Gemara notes that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rami bar Rav Yuda said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said </span>the following about it: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From the day the Book </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Genealogies was hidde</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">n</span> and no longer available to the Sages, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the strength of the Sages has been weakened, and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the light of their eyes has been dimmed, </span>as the book contained the reasons for many Torah laws and lists of genealogies that are now lost.",

            "A question was raised with regard to this mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">outside the wall?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>say that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> disagree about an uncertain warning</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> There is a general rule that the courts only administer corporal punishment if the transgressor was warned before he committed the transgression. The question arises as to whether punishments are administered after an uncertain warning, i.e., when it is unclear at the time of the warning whether or not the person being warned will actually transgress. It is possible to explain that this is the basis of the dispute with regard to leaven: If the leaven is outside the Temple courtyard, the one issuing the warning cannot be certain that the person he is warning actually has leaven in his possession at the time of the slaughter. The Gemara suggests that such a warning is considered an uncertain warning, and Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that an uncertain warning is a valid warning while Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish disagrees. However, this is difficult, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> also disagreed about this once </span>before.", 
            "As <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it was stated </span>that if a person said: I take <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an oath that I </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">will eat this loaf today, and the day passed and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he did not eat it, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ben Lakish both said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he is not flogged </span>even though he violated his oath and thereby transgressed the prohibition of: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain” (Exodus 19:7).

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Oshaya asked Rabbi Ami </span>the following question: If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the slaughterer does not have </span>leaven in his possession <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but one of the members of the group does </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">have, what is </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>?

            "Rav Oshaya <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to </span>Rav Ashi: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, even if someone at the end of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">world </span>has leaven it should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">also </span>be a violation.

People who are not part of this group are not obligated to ensure that the Paschal lamb does not remain until the morning; similarly, they are not taken into account with regard to the prohibition against sacrificing the offering while in possession of leaven.",

The Paschal offering consisted of either a lamb or a goat, sometimes quite young and unable to walk the entire way, so that it had to be carried on a person’s shoulders. Similarly, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bringing it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from outside the Shabbat limit and cutting off its wart</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> do not override Shabbat, </span>as all these tasks could have been performed before Shabbat. A wart is considered a blemish that disqualifies the animal from being brought as an offering, but once the wart is removed, the animal is fit to be sacrificed on the altar. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>All of these procedures <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">override </span>Shabbat.

", 
            "Having cited verses dealing with the requirement to send out the ritually impure from the camp, the Gemara addresses several <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> relevant to that topic. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ḥisda</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: A leper, </span>who must be sent out from all of the camps including the Israelite camp, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who went</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in beyond his boundary, </span>that is, he entered an area that is prohibited to him, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>nonetheless <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">exempt </span>from the punishment of lashes. With regard to the ritually impure, the Torah states: “Both male and female shall you send out, outside the camp shall you send them, and they shall defile not their camps in the midst of which I dwell” (Numbers 5:3), from which we learn that an impure person who enters the camp is liable to receive lashes for having violated the prohibition of “they shall not defile.” A leper, however, is exempt, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is stated: </span>“All the days that the plague shall be in him he shall be impure; he is impure, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he shall dwell </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in isolation, his dwelling shall be outside the camp” </span>(Leviticus 13:46).", 
            "The Gemara explains that the verse is explicated in the following manner: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“He</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> shall dwell in isolation” </span>means <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he shall dwell alone, </span>without even the company of others who are impure. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“His </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">dwelling shall be outside the camp” </span>teaches that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">has transmuted </span>the negative precept <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">into a positive mitzva</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> In other words, the verse establishes that if a leper entered an area that is prohibited to him, he is commanded to leave, and fulfilling this command removes the full force of the prohibition he has already violated. The rule is that lashes are not administered for the violation of a prohibition, if that violation can be rectified by the fulfillment of a positive commandment.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">An objection was raised against </span>Rav Ḥisda from a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A leper, </span>who may not even enter the Israelite camp, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who went in beyond his boundary, </span>is punished <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with forty </span>lashes like one who violates a regular Torah prohibition.

Since Moses was a Levite and lived in the Levite camp, it follows that even a corpse may be brought into the Levite camp.

            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is </span>a matter that is subject to dispute between <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">tanna’im</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, for it was</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> taught </span>in a different <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“He shall dwell in </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">isolation” </span>indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he shall dwell alone, </span>meaning <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that other </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritually impure people, </span>such as <span class=\"it-text\">zavin</span> and those who are ritually impure due to contact with a corpse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">should not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">dwell with him. </span>One <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought that <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zavin</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">those who are ritually impure due to </span>contact with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">corpse are sent to one camp, </span>meaning that the laws governing which camps they may or may not enter are the same for both. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Therefore, the verse states: </span>“Both male and female shall you send out, outside the camp shall you send them out, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and they shall defile not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> their camps </span>in the midst of which I dwell” (Numbers 5:3).

            "The Gemara questions the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: We see from the discussion cited above that it was clear to Rabbi Shimon that the impurity of a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> is more severe than that of one who is ritually impure due to contact with a corpse, and that the impurity of a leper is even more severe than that of a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the stringency</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> over one who is ritually impure due</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to a corpse</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> That </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity </span>of the <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">issues out upon him from his </span>own <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">body, </span>rather than coming from an external source, as is the case when impurity is contracted from a corpse.

            "As we have been discussing the world of the future and the resurrection of the dead, the Gemara cites additional statements on these topics. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ulla raised a contradiction </span>between two verses: In one verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written: “He will destroy death </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">forever, </span>and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the insult of His people shall He take away from off all the earth; for the Lord has spoken” (Isaiah 25:8). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>in another verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is written: </span>“There shall be no more there an infant who lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for the youngest shall </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">die a hundred years old</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">”</span> (Isaiah 65:20), implying that people will live long lives, but death will not be totally eradicated. Ulla answers: This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not difficult: Here, </span>in the first verse, it is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Jews, </span>who will not die at all, while <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there, </span>in the second verse, it is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">gentiles, </span>who will live exceedingly long lives but eventually die.

The Gemara answers: This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not difficult: Here, </span>where it says that the sun and the moon will be ashamed before the glow of the Divine Presence, it is referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to the World</span>-<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to</span>-<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Come, </span>which is an entirely different world; while <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there, </span>where it says that their light will increase, it is referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to the days of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Messiah.</span>",

The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This and that </span>refer <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to the World</span>-<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to</span>-<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Come, and </span>it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not difficult: Here, </span>where it says that the sun and the moon will be totally ashamed, it refers to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the camp of the Divine Presence; </span>while <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there, </span>where it says that the light of the sun and moon will be greatly magnified, it refers to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">camp of the righteous. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava raised a contradiction </span>between two parts of a verse. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is written: “I put to death and I</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> make live” </span>(Deuteronomy 32:39) <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>in that same verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written: “I wound and I heal.” Now </span>once it says that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He gives life </span>to the dead, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the more so </span>is it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>clear that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He </span>can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">heal </span>those who are still alive? What then does the second clause add to the first? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>the second clause clarifies the first one: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Holy One, Blessed be He, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: Those </span>same people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">whom I put to death I </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">will bring to life, just as </span>those people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">whom I </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">wounded I will heal. </span>In other words, the verse means to say that just as God will heal the same people He wounded, so will He revive those He put to death; and not, as the verse might otherwise have been understood, that He puts some people to death and gives life to others.

            "Similarly, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Sages taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“I put to death and I make live”; </span>one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might have thought </span>that this refers to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">death for </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>person <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and life, </span>i.e., birth, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for another </span>person, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in the customary manner of the world. </span>Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> states: “I wound and I heal”; just as the wounding</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and the healing </span>mentioned here clearly refer to the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">same</span> person, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so too death and life </span>refer to the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">same</span> person. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From this </span>verse, there is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a refutation to those</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> who say that there is no Torah source for the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> resurrection of the dead, </span>for it is explicitly mentioned in this verse. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Alternatively, </span>the verse can be explained as follows: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">At first, those whom I put to death I will</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> bring to life</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> but they will be revived with the same injuries that they had when they died; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> subsequently, those whom I wounded I will heal, </span>meaning that their injuries will be healed after they are resurrected.

            "The Gemara questions the reason for the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> under discussion. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the reason that </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sprinkling </span>of purifying water <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does not override Shabbat? Since it </span>involves the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">mere moving </span>of the liquid from the utensil in his hand to the body of the person seeking purification, why should it be forbidden on Shabbat? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let it </span>at least <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">override Shabbat on account </span>of the mitzva <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Paschal lamb. Rabba said: </span>The prohibition against sprinkling is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span>rabbinic <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">decree </span>that was instituted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lest one take </span>the utensil containing the purifying water <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and carry it </span>a distance of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">four cubits in the public domain</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> thus violating an actual Torah prohibition. This is consistent with Rabba’s opinion in several other places in the Talmud that the Sages forbade the fulfillment of certain mitzvot due to a similar concern about carrying in the public domain.", 
            "The Gemara asks: At least <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">according to Rabbi Eliezer, let us carry </span>the purifying water even in the public domain, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for Rabbi Eliezer said </span>as a general rule that actions that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">facilitate </span>the performance of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a mitzva override Shabbat</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> even if they are not mitzvot themselves and involve transgression of Torah prohibitions. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>that there is room to distinguish between different situations: The rule that actions necessary to facilitate a mitzva override Shabbat only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">applies when the person himself is fit </span>to fulfill the mitzva <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and the obligation </span>to fulfill it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">incumbent upon him.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Abaye raised an objection to </span>Rabba’s distinction between someone who is currently fit for the mitzva and someone who is not, based on what was taught elsewhere in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">An uncircumcised </span>adult <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did not circumcise </span>himself before Passover <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is liable to the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> punishment of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span> for having intentionally violated the mitzva to bring the Paschal lamb, as an uncircumcised person may not eat of the offering; this is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the statement of Rabbi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Eliezer. But here the person himself is not fit, </span>for as long as he is uncircumcised he is not obligated to bring the Paschal lamb, and nonetheless the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> teaching that he is punished with </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.

            "On the basis of these principles, we can say as follows: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lack of circumcision, if the entire community is uncircumcise</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> we say to them: Arise, and circumcise yourselves, and offer</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the Paschal lamb, </span>and we do not allow them to offer the sacrifice while uncircumcised.

            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an objection </span>from a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> in which it was taught: One <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that only one who was pure </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and not on a distant journey is punishable by </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span> for having neglected to offer the Paschal lamb, as the Torah explicitly states that a person who was ritually impure or on a distant journey is exempt from the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> and obligated in the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>. But as for one who was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">uncircumcised or ritually impure from a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">creeping animal and all the others who are ritually impure </span>not from a corpse, and they did not undergo circumcision or purification before Passover, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from where </span>do we know that they are also liable to receive <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The verse states: </span>“But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, then that person shall be cut off from his people” (Numbers 9:13); the expression <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“but the man” </span>comes to include anyone who can become pure and fit to participate in the Paschal lamb, but fails to do so.",

For</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> if one may slaughter and sprinkle for someone impure from</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a creeping animal, why did he search for </span>a source to include <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it? He is </span>the same as anyone who is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pure </span>and did not offer the Paschal lamb, for he could have sent his offering with someone else and eaten from it in the evening after having undergone ritual immersion. Rather, it is clear that one may not slaughter or sprinkle for him; and, nonetheless, if he neglected the mitzva of the Paschal lamb, he is liable to receive <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently </span>then, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although he was not fit </span>at that time to offer the Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the obligation is </span>nonetheless <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">incumbent upon him </span>to render himself fit. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And although </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this does not apply to the community, </span>for a community that is impure with the impurity of a creeping animal brings the Paschal lamb in a state of impurity, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does apply to an individual.</span>",

However, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eating of the Paschal lamb</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is not essentia</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">l</span> for the fulfillment of the mitzva, for if the blood of the sacrifice is sprinkled in a permitted fashion on someone’s behalf and afterward he is unable to eat the meat of the sacrifice, e.g., it became impure or was lost, he has fulfilled his obligation and is not liable to receive <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span>.

There is a big difference: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Eight you do not find at all; </span>the eight days of the Festival cannot possibly pass without a Shabbat.

This verse seems superfluous, as it was already stated in the previous verse: “And you shall rejoice in your Festival.” The <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> expounds: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And you shall be but joyous” </span>comes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to include the last night of the Festival</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> Even then you must make sure there is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">rejoicing </span>by eating the appropriate peace-offerings. The <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> considers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Do you say </span>that the verse comes to include <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the last night of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Festival? Or </span>perhaps <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it </span>comes to include <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">only the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first night of the Festival. </span>Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: </span>“And you shall be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but joyous”; </span>the word “but” <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">restricts </span>this mitzva, meaning that there is not always a mitzva to be joyous.", 
            "The Gemara clarifies how this <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> supports Ulla: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the reason </span>that we learn from this expression that it is specifically on the first night that there is no mitzva of rejoicing? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Is it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not because </span>on the first night <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he has nothing with</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> which to rejoice? </span>As Ulla said, one cannot fulfill the mitzva of rejoicing with a peace-offering that was slaughtered on the eve of the Festival, because it was not slaughtered at the time of rejoicing.

According to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ben Teima</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>however, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he has disqualified it by leaving it overnight, </span>for in his view this Festival peace-offering is similar to a Paschal lamb and may not be eaten the following day. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Learn from this </span>that the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> must be referring to a case where the Festival peace-offering was slaughtered not on the fourteenth, but on the fifteenth.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava raised an objection </span>against the opinion of Ulla: It was taught in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">hallel</span> is recited <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>the mitzva of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">rejoicing </span>with the peace-offerings of rejoicing is observed on the festival of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eight </span>days. Now <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if you say we require</span> that the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter </span>be performed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at a time of rejoicing</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, many times you find </span>that the mitzva of rejoicing is observed for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">only seven </span>days, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">such as when the first</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> day of the Festival occurs on Shabbat, </span>when a peace-offering of rejoicing may not be slaughtered. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Huna, son</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of Rav Yehuda, said: One rejoices with the male goats</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of the Festivals. </span>That is to say, in such a situation the mitzva of rejoicing can be fulfilled with the meat of the goats that are brought on the Festivals as sin-offerings, as these offerings, being communal offerings, may be slaughtered even on Shabbat.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: There are two </span>possible <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">responses to </span>refute <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this. One </span>is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that the male goats of the Festivals are eaten ra</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">w</span> and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are not eaten roasted. </span>Being a non-essential part of the service, roasting the meat is forbidden on Shabbat. Therefore, the meat can be eaten only raw, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there is no rejoicing with raw </span>meat. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And furthermore, </span>only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the priests eat </span>of the meat of these sin-offerings. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">With what </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do </span>ordinary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Israelites rejoice</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Rather, Rav </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Pappa said: </span>In such a situation, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one rejoices with clean </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">clothes and old wine. </span>",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava raised a dilemma before </span>Rav Naḥman: If one unwittingly slaughtered an <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">unconsecrated </span>animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for the purpose of a Paschal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> offering, what would Rabbi Meir say? </span>Would he exempt him in this case as well? Rav Naḥman <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: Rabbi Meir would exempt </span>him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even </span>if he slaughtered an <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">unconsecrated </span>animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for the purpose of a Paschal offering.</span>", 
            "Rava asked him: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But didn’t Rabbi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Yoḥanan say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Meir concedes </span>that if one slaughtered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">blemished </span>animals on Shabbat he is liable to bring a sin-offering, as they are never sacrificed as offerings, and similarly, unconsecrated animals are never sacrificed as offerings? Rav Naḥman responded: There is room for a distinction. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Blemished </span>animals <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">cannot</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be confused </span>with unblemished ones, and so there is no legitimate reason for error; but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these, </span>i.e., unconsecrated animals, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">can </span>easily <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be confused </span>with consecrated animals, as they are externally indistinguishable from one another, and therefore one who confuses them is exempt.", 
            "Rava asked further: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And is Rabbi Meir’s reason </span>really <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that these can be confused and these cannot be confused</span> with a legitimate offering? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But didn’t Rav Beivai say</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that Rabbi Elazar said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Meir would exempt </span>him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even </span>in the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a calf of a peace</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that he slaughtered for the purpose of the Paschal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> offering, </span>even though there is no way to mistake a calf for an animal that can be brought for the Paschal offering? Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is apparent </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Meir’s</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> reason is that he is preoccupied </span>with sacrificing the calf as an offering, and consequently he is exempt if he erred and slaughtered it for the purpose of a Paschal lamb. But why should one be exempt if he brought an unconsecrated animal for the purpose of a Paschal offering? He is not preoccupied with bringing it as an offering. ", 
            "Rav Naḥman <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: </span>Both reasons apply according to Rabbi Meir. If one is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">preoccupied </span>with bringing the animal as an offering, he is exempt <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> though </span>the animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">cannot </span>easily <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be confused </span>with the one he was supposed to sacrifice.

This comes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to exclude</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> blemished </span>animals, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which cannot be confused </span>with unblemished animals <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and</span> with whose sacrifice he <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is not preoccupied. </span>", 
            "The Gemara relates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Zeira and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak were sitting on the porch </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, and they sat and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: If one </span>unwittingly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">confused</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a spit of leftover </span>sacrificial meat, which it is prohibited to eat and which makes one liable to receive the punishment of <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span> when one eats it intentionally, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> spit of roasted </span>sacrificial meat, which is a mitzva to eat, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and he ate it, he is liable </span>to bring a sin-offering. Although he intended to do a mitzva, since he unwittingly transgressed the prohibition against eating leftover sacrificial meat, he must bring a sin-offering. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>they further reported that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>unwittingly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">engaged in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> sexual intercourse with his wife while she was menstruating, he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is liable </span>to bring a sin-offering.

A man whose brother died without children is obliged by Torah law to marry his deceased widow and “come to her” (Deuteronomy 25:5), so that even if he mistakenly transgressed while attempting to fulfill the mitzva, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering.", 
            "The Gemara attempts to determine whether Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees or disagrees with Reish Lakish’s ruling: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Some say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all the more so in the </span>first case, where one unwittingly ate a spit of leftover sacrificial meat, Rabbi Yoḥanan would <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">deem </span>him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">liable </span>to bring a sin-offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for he did not </span>actually <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">perform a mitzva</span> when he ate the meat, even though he intended to do so.

            "The Gemara raises another question: Nevertheless, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>the mitzva of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">enjoyment of conjugal rights. </span>One of a husband’s marital obligations is to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife at regular intervals (see Exodus 21:10), and this is considered a mitzva. The Gemara answers that we are talking about a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not the time of her conjugal rights.</span>", 
            "The Gemara asks further: Even so, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">didn’t Rava say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a man is obligated </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to please his wife through a mitzva</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?</span> That is to say, he must engage in sexual intercourse with her when she so desires, even if it is not the time of her conjugal rights. The Gemara answers that we are dealing with a case where it was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">near her </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">expected date </span>of menstruation, when sexual relations are prohibited due to a concern that the woman may already be menstruating or that she may begin to menstruate during the sexual act.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, </span>i.e., if they engaged in sexual intercourse near the woman’s expected date of menstruation when he should have refrained from doing so, then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even </span>in the case where he had sexual intercourse with <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his sister-in-law </span>and she turned out to be menstruating, he should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">also </span>be liable, as the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply at that time.

", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with whose </span>opinion did he rule with regard to one who erred while engaged in a mitzva? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you say </span>he ruled <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei, as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">says: </span>If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the first Festival day of the festival </span>of <span class=\"it-text\">Sukkot</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">occurs on Shabbat, and he forgot and carried </span>his <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">lula</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">v</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">out into the public domain </span>and continued to transport it there, unwittingly performing a prohibited labor, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he is exempt</span> from bringing a sin-offering. That is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because he carried</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it out with permission, </span>that is to say, he was acting with the intention of fulfilling a mitzva. ", 
            "There is room to differentiate between Rabbi Yosei’s ruling and that of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Perhaps it is different there, as he is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> pressed for time. </span>Since by Torah law the mitzva of <span class=\"it-text\">lulav</span> applies only one day a year, he is anxious to fulfill the mitzva and therefore does not realize that he is violating a Torah prohibition. This is unlike the case of levirate marriage, which need not be performed at any specific time and about which he is less pressured.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>one might say that Rabbi Yoḥanan issued his ruling in accordance with the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Yehoshua </span>in our mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with regard to offerings, </span>for according to Rabbi Yehoshua, one who unwittingly slaughtered another offering on Shabbat for the purpose of a Paschal offering, and the animal was fit to be brought as a Paschal offering, is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. Here too, however, there is room to differentiate. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Perhaps there also </span>we can say that Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pressed for time.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>one might say that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yehoshua with regard to babies, </span>one that should have been circumcised on Shabbat eve and the other on Shabbat, and the circumciser forgot and circumcised the one that should have been circumcised on Shabbat eve on Shabbat. In that case the circumciser is exempt from bringing a sin-offering.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>we should say that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehoshua</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> with regard to </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, as we learned </span>in a mishna: If a priest <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was eating </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and it became</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> known that he was the son of a divorced woman</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> or a woman who underwent </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥalitza</span> and he is therefore disqualified from the priesthood and may not eat <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Eliezer deems </span>him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">liable </span>to pay <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span>value of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">principal and </span>an additional <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fifth, </span>like any non-priest who unwittingly ate <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span>, whereas <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehoshua exempts </span>him. In this case, one who thought he was a priest and therefore fulfilling a mitzva when he ate the <span class=\"it-text\">teruma</span> was actually committing a transgression, but nevertheless, Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him from the ordinary penalty. On the face of it, this is similar to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling.", 
            "This comparison can, however, be rejected, for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">perhaps </span>that case should be explained <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Beivai bar Abaye. For Rav Beivai bar Abaye said</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: </span>The mishna is talking about a disqualified priest who ate <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span> which is leaven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the eve of Passover, whose</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> time is pressing, </span>because if he does not eat it quickly he will have to burn it.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Alternatively, </span>there may be another reason to differentiate: Eating <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is different, because it is called </span>sacred <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">service</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, and the Merciful One validates service </span>performed by someone of priestly descent even if he is not fit for the priesthood.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As we learned </span>in a mishna: If a priest <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> standing and sacrificing offerings </span>on the altar, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it became</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> known that he was the son of a divorced woman</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> or the son of a woman who underwent </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥalitza</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all the offerings that he offered on the altar </span>until that time <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are disqualified, </span>because only service performed by a priest deemed fit is acceptable. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Yehoshua validates </span>them. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And we said: What is the reason of Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Yehoshua? As it is written </span>with regard to the tribe of Levi: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Bless, Lord, his substance and accept the work</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of his hands” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:11), which teaches that after the fact, God accepts the work of a priest’s hands, even if it becomes clear that he was actually disqualified at the time he performed the service.

            "The Gemara questions what was stated above: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And where is </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">teruma</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> called service? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: There was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">incident involving Rabbi Tarfon, who did not come in the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">evening to the study hall.

            "We learned in the mishna that if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughtered </span>the Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it became known </span>afterward that the owners had died, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Huna said that Rav said: </span>Regarding <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">guilt-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that was consigned to grazing: </span>If the owner of a guilt-offering dies or achieves atonement through a different guilt-offering, the animal is sent out to graze in the field until it develops a blemish, at which point it can be sold.

            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If so, </span>even <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when it has not </span>yet <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">been </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">consigned </span>to grazing, it should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">also </span>be valid, for any guilt-offering whose owner has achieved atonement through a different offering is presumably going to be brought as a free-will burnt-offering. The Gemara answers: This invalidation stems from a rabbinic <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">decree </span>with regard to a guilt-offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after </span>its owner achieved <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">atonement </span>with a different offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">due to </span>concern about a guilt-offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">before </span>its owner achieved <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">atonement </span>with a different offering. Before the owner achieves atonement the animal is certainly considered a guilt-offering; it is only after the owner achieves atonement that the offering becomes valid for use as a burnt-offering, and then by strict <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> it is immediately valid for that purpose, even before the animal develops a blemish. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From where do you </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>that this is the case? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As we learned </span>elsewhere in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A guilt-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> whose owner has died </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">or whose owner has achieved atonemen</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">t</span> through a different guilt-offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">grazes until it becomes unfit, </span>whereupon <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is sold</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and its money is used for a </span>communal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">free-will</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> burnt-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.

            "This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehoshua, as soon as the owner achieves atonement, his animal loses its status as a guilt-offering and it becomes a burnt-offering.

Undoubtedly, his reason must be that the Sages issued <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a decree </span>with regard to a guilt-offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after </span>its owner achieved <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">atonement </span>with a different offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">due to </span>concern about a guilt-offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">before </span>its owner achieved <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">atonement </span>with a different offering.

            "The Gemara raises a general halakhic discussion related to the mishna. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba said: This stuffing </span>of raw meat inside another animal that is being roasted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is permitted</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> even if the meat that is stuffed inside has not been salted to remove the blood. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Abaye said to him: But </span>the meat of the animal being roasted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">absorbs bloo</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> from the stuffing. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He said to him: As it absorbs it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, so it </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">emits it. </span>The heat of the fire causes blood to be released from the meat used as stuffing into the meat of the animal being stuffed, and the heat then draws the blood out of that meat as well.

            "The Gemara suggests further: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> us say </span>that the following mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">supports him: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the heart </span>of an animal, one must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">tear it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and remove its bloo</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> before one roasts or cooks it.

This would support the opinion of Rabba. ", 
            "The Gemara refutes the proof: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">A heart</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is different </span>because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is smooth </span>and does not absorb much blood.

            "The Gemara raises another discussion with regard to blood absorbed in meat. People would soak raw meat (<span class=\"it-text\">Tosafot</span>) in vinegar in order to ensure that none of the blood would separate from its original place and prohibit the meat from being eaten, as it is permitted to eat blood that has not separated from its original place. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This </span>piece of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raw</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> meat, whose vinegar became re</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> due to the blood absorbed in it, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is forbidden. </span>If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its vinegar did not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">become red, it is permitted.

            "It was taught in the mishna that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one </span>may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not roast the Paschal lamb </span>on a grill. Subsequently, the mishna quotes an incident in which Rabban Gamliel instructed his servant to roast the Paschal lamb for him on a grill. The Gemara expresses surprise: Was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an incident </span>cited <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to contradict </span>what was previously stated? The Gemara responds: The mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is incomplet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and is teaching the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> following: And if it is a perforated grill, </span>so that the fire reaches each part of the meat and the animal will not be roasted from the heat of the grill itself, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is permitted.

            "The Gemara cites a discussion related to the subject of roasting the Paschal lamb. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ḥinnana</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> bar Idi raised a dilemma before Rav Adda bar Ahava</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: </span>In the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an oven that one fired with</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> peels of </span>fruit that are <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">orla</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> i.e., fruit that grows on a tree the first three years after it was planted, from which one may not receive any benefit, if, after the oven became very hot, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he swept</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it </span>and removed the fuel and the ashes, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> baked bread in it, according to the opinion that prohibits</span> bread baked directly with heat from <span class=\"it-text\">orla</span> fuel, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what is</span> the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to this bread? It was baked with the heat trapped in the oven only after the fuel was removed. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He said to him: The bread is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> permitted. </span>", 
            "Rav Ḥinnana <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But didn’t Rav Ḥinnana the Elder say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Asi said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>If there is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">oven that one fired and swept </span>so that the heat remains but there is no longer any fire in the oven, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>one then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted the Paschal lamb in it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> this is not </span>a fulfillment of the Torah’s command that the Paschal lamb must be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted in fire</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, as it is stated </span>in the Torah: “And they shall eat the meat on that night, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted in fire, </span>and <span class=\"it-text\">matzot</span>; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Do not eat of it raw, nor boiled in water, but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted in fire; </span>its head with its legs and with its inner parts” (Exodus 12:8–9), and since it says the phrase: Roasted in fire, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two times, </span>the verse emphasizes that the Paschal lamb must literally be roasted on the fire?

            "The following can now be inferred: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The reason </span>is specifically because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Merciful</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> One reveals </span>this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to the Paschal lamb in the Torah by repeating: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Roasted in fire, roasted in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> fire, twice. But </span>if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Merciful One had not revealed</span> this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> by emphasizing the need to roast it directly on the fire, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">I would have said </span>a Paschal lamb roasted in an oven that has already been swept <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is</span> nonetheless considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted in fire. </span>Therefore, in other situations in which something is roasted in an oven, even if it is not roasted directly from the heat of a fire, its status should be comparable to something that was roasted directly from the fuel. If the fuel is forbidden, the food should be forbidden. ", 
            "Rav Adda bar Ahava <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to </span>Rav Ḥinnana bar Idi: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Merciful One reveals it there, </span>with regard to the Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and we learn from it </span>that even in other areas of <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>, only something that is roasted directly by a fire is considered roasted in fire. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you wish, say </span>a different answer instead: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">There, </span>in the case of the Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the reason </span>one may not roast the lamb if one has already swept out the oven <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is that the Merciful One writes “roasted in fire” twice</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. But </span>if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Merciful One had not written “roasted in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> fire” twice, I would have said that the Merciful One</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is particular about fire, </span>meaning that the source of the heat in the oven should be fire, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and even if</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> one swept it, it is </span>still considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">roasted in fire</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>It was therefore necessary to repeat the phrase “roasted in fire.” <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But here, </span>in the case of <span class=\"it-text\">orla</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Merciful One is particular about the prohibited fuel, and it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is not here </span>in the oven.

            "Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raised a contradiction </span>based on the Torah’s statement with regard to the laws of leprosy: “Or flesh that shall have on its skin <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a burn from fire” </span>(Leviticus 13:24). From the fact that it says a burn from fire, I have derived <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">nothing other </span>than a case in which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is burned</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> by fire </span>itself; if it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is burned by a coal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, by burning ash, by burning lime, by burning plaster [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">gipsis</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> or </span>by <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">anything </span>else that is burning <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>whose source of heat <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">comes from fire, to include </span>also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">water</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> heated by fire, from where </span>is it derived that these are also considered a burn from fire? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The verse </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">states: A burn, a burn, </span>twice.

            "The Gemara expresses surprise at the previous answer: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And are </span>red-hot <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pieces of metal not </span>considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fire?

If </span>it had stated only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fire, </span>I <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought it was referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> flame. Therefore, the verse states: Coals. How </span>are these two requirements reconciled? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">One brings from the </span>coals that are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">flickering</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>meaning that the fire is visible. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Apparently, </span>plain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">coals </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are not called fire. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Say </span>in answer to this question: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Isn’t this </span><span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">itself difficult?

Therefore, the Torah states: Fire. If </span>it had stated only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fire, </span>I <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought it was referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a flame. Therefore, the verse states: Coals.

The Gemara posits two assumptions and then compares the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua to the mishna. It states as a preface that the Sages originally <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">assumed that</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> everyone agrees that ritual impurity is overridden in </span>cases involving <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the public</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> In other words, the prohibition against sacrificing offerings in a state of ritual impurity applies to communal offerings, but it is superseded by the obligation to sacrifice the offering. Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the frontplate </span>of the High Priest <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> required to appease </span>God for the sacrifice of the offering in a state of ritual impurity.

As it was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The frontplate </span>of the High Priest, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">whether it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on his forehead or whether it is not on his </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">forehead, appeases </span>God and thereby facilitates the acceptance of offerings sacrificed in a state of impurity; this is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the statement</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>When <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is still</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> on his forehead it appeases </span>God, but when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is no longer on his forehead it does not appease</span> Him, as indicated in the verse: “And it shall be on Aaron’s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the sacred things which the children of Israel shall hallow” (Exodus 28:38).

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon said to </span>Rabbi Yehuda: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The </span><span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">High Priest on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Yom Kippu</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">r</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> shall prove </span>it, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span>the frontplate <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not on his forehead, and it </span>nonetheless <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">appeases </span>God if communal offerings are brought in a state of ritual impurity.

            "Rabbi Yehuda <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Set aside Yom Kippur, as ritual impurity </span>is wholly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>cases involving <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the public. </span>The frontplate is needed only to atone for individual offerings that are brought in a state of ritual impurity.

Therefore, the frontplate is needed to appease God for the sacrifice of the offering in a state of ritual impurity. ",

Therefore, at the time the Paschal lamb is slaughtered, it is uncertain whether they are ritually pure or impure, because if they have another discharge before the end of the day, they are retroactively considered to have been impure the entire time. From the fact that they are exempt from the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> even if it turns out that they were ritually impure, it appears that the frontplate does appease God for uncertain ritual impurity due to the discharge of a <span class=\"it-text\">zava</span>.

            "The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Whichever way you </span>look at Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, it is difficult: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If he holds </span>that that the <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">renders </span>objects <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impure retroactively, </span>the new discharge <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">should cancel all</span> the days.

The term <span class=\"it-text\">lakhem</span> is interpreted as indicating that the impurity must be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">clear to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">lakhem</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]. </span>However, any ritual impurity that is not clearly identified does not render one who wishes to sacrifice the Paschal lamb impure. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: </span>This <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> may be derived in a different way, from the word “road,” which is juxtaposed in the verse to the phrase “ritually impure.” This indicates that the impurity is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">like</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a road. Just as a road is in the open</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, so too, the impurity is in the open. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Gemara raises an objection </span>to these derivations from that which was taught in the following <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Which is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the impurity of the dee</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">p</span> that was permitted for both a nazirite and one who sacrifices the Paschal lamb?

In other words, it was due to the deaths of his sons, which Aaron referred as “events such as these,” that Aaron burned the sin-offering instead of eating it. ", 
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan analyzes Rabbi Neḥemya’s statement: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Now, acute mourning is similar to </span>a case of disqualification <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after sprinkling </span>of the blood, because acute mourning merely disqualifies the owners from eating the offering. It does not disqualify the actual performance of the sacrificial service by a High Priest, such as Aaron. Therefore, it is like other disqualifications that take effect after the sprinkling, which simply prohibit the eating of the meat. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And when it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was burned, it was burned immediately, </span>without waiting until the following day.

The Gemara responds: This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not difficult.

In other words, at first it was known which was the forbidden right nerve and which was the permitted left nerve. However, they were then mixed together and can no longer be identified. Therefore, due to the uncertainty, they must both be burned. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ashi said: </span>The mishna’s ruling that the sinews must be burned <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">necessary only </span>with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the fat of the sciatic </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">nerve, as it was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The fat </span>around the sciatic nerve <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is permitted </span>according to Torah law, but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Jewish people are hol</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">y</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and treat it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as forbidden. </span>Since it is permitted according to Torah law, it has the status of meat and may not be simply discarded.

            "It was taught in the mishna that if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the sixteenth </span>of Nisan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">occurs </span>on Shabbat, the burning of the leftover does not override Shabbat, and they are burned on the seventeenth.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Ḥizkiya said, and similarly, </span>one of the Sages in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the school of Ḥizkiya taught: The verse </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">states: “And you shall not leave any of it until </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">morning; and that which remains of it until morning you </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shall burn with fire” </span>(Exodus 12:10). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As </span>there is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">no</span> need for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse to state “until morning,” </span>and repeating that phrase adds nothing to the verse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what </span>is the meaning when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states “until morning”? </span>It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> give it a second morning for its burning. </span>In other words, it comes to teach that the mitzva to burn the leftover does not apply on the first morning, i.e., the morning of the Festival when they become prohibited to eat, but on the second morning, the sixteenth of Nisan. However, when the sixteenth falls on Shabbat, the burning is delayed until the seventeenth. ", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Abaye said: </span>The reason is because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: “The burnt-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of each Shabbat </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on its Shabbat </span>in addition to the continual burnt-offering and its libation” (Numbers 28:10). This indicates that the burnt-offering of Shabbat may be offered on the altar on Shabbat or burned if it is disqualified, but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">burnt-offering of a weekday on Shabbat, and not the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">burnt-offering of a weekday on a Festival. </span>It is derived from here that one may not burn anything on Shabbat that is not an obligation of that day.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said </span>a different reason: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The verse states </span>concerning Festivals: “And on the first day there shall be a sacred convocation; no kind of labor shall be done on them, save that which every man must eat, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">only</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that may be done for you” </span>(Exodus 12:16).

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Reish Lakish </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>It was stated that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">anything eaten in an adult ox may be eaten in </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a young kid, and what are these </span>parts? They are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the ends of the ribs and the cartilage. </span>This indicates that with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these </span>items, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">yes, </span>they may be eaten; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but </span>with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sinews that will eventually harden</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, no, </span>they may not. This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. Rabbi Yoḥanan<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said to him: It taught these, </span>the ends of the ribs and the cartilage,<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">same is true for those, </span>i.e., the same <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> applies to sinews that will eventually harden. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">reason </span>that people may register for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these, </span>the ends of the ribs and the cartilage? It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because they are </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eaten in an adult ox through cooking. These, too, </span>the sinews that will eventually harden, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are eaten in an adult </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ox through cooking. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yirmeya </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to Rabbi Avin: When you go before Rabbi Abbahu, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raise </span>the following <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">contradiction to him: Did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sinews that will eventually harden, </span>people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may register for them in the Paschal lamb, </span>which would <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">apparently </span>indicate that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we go </span>according to<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the current </span>condition of the sinews? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But Reish Lakish asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the hide of the head of a young </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">calf, </span>which is still edible, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what is </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to the possibility of it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">becoming ritually impure </span>as a food? Do we view it as a food and apply the rules of ritual impurity of foods, or do we view it as a hide? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And he said to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">him: It does not become ritually impure. Apparently, we go </span>according to<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the eventual </span>condition of the hide, which contradicts Rabbi Yoḥanan’s own opinion with regard to sinews. ", 
            "When Rabbi Avin came before Rabbi Abbahu and asked him this question, Rabbi Abbahu<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said to him: </span>Whoever <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">asked you this </span>question <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was not concerned for his flour</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> meaning he did not carefully consider what he said. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yoḥanan retracted </span>his opinion in this regard in favor of the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Reish Lakish, and </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him, </span>at the end of their discussion on the topic: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Do not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">trouble me </span>by asking a question based on a mishna that seems to prove that we follow the current state of the hide, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as I teach it in the singular. </span>That mishna, on which I previously relied, is the opinion of one Sage and should not be relied upon. This proves that Rabbi Yoḥanan changed his mind and concluded that the status of parts of the animal is established based on their eventual condition.

There is good reason for this, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And you shall not leave any of it until morning; and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that which remains of it until morning </span>you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The verse comes to provide </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a positive </span>mitzva to burn the leftover <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">after the prohibition </span>against leaving it over, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to say that one is not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">flogged </span>because any prohibition that can be rectified by the performance of a positive mitzva does not carry a punishment of lashes. This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Ya’akov says: This is not for </span>that<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> reason.

But </span>with regard to<span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> one who breaks </span>the bone <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a ritually impure </span>Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from where do we </span>derive that he, too, does not receive lashes? The Gemara answers that the source is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: </span>“In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not remove any of the meat from the house to the outside, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and you shall not break a bone</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in it” </span>(Exodus 12:46). It may be inferred that the prohibition applies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in it,” in a valid </span>Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and not in </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a disqualified </span>one.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And why </span>did they construct two measures for cubits, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one large and one small? </span>It was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that the artisans </span>who were working in the Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">would </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">take </span>payment according the amount of work they did, as measured <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by the small </span>cubit, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and return </span>it to the Temple through their work, as measured <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by the large </span>cubit, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so they would not come to misuse consecrated property.</span> If they would accept any payment that they did not deserve, they would be misusing consecrated property. Therefore, this system of measuring was instituted in order to slightly reduce their payment and prevent accidental misuse of Temple funds. The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And why do I </span>need <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">two </span>large cubits?

However, despite this, both the master and the slave are exempt from observing the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Abaye said: They </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught </span>that they are exempt from the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> in a case where the master <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">forgot only after </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sprinklin</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">g</span> of the blood on the altar, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for at the time</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the blood </span>of each animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was sprinkled, it was </span>still <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fit to be eaten, </span>since the master still knew which animal he desired. Both animals are therefore considered to have been offered properly, and so both master and slave are exempt from the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But </span>if the slave <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">had</span> already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">forgotten </span>which animal he specified <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">before the sprinkling, </span>so <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that when the blood was sprinkled </span>the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> fit to be eaten, </span>the animals are not considered to have been properly offered. Consequently, the master and slave <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are</span> both <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obligated to observe </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Pesaḥ</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Some teach this </span>statement of Abaye as referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>the following <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">baraita</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: Five </span>people had the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hides of their Paschal lambs mixed up together</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, and a wart was found on one of them. </span>Since a wart is one of the blemishes that disqualify an animal from being used as an offering, the Paschal lamb from which the hide came is invalid. Since it is not possible to identify which lamb the hide came from, the meat of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all </span>of the lambs must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">go out</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to the place </span>designated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for burning. </span>Nevertheless, all five people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are exempt from observing </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Pesaḥ</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span>", 
            "It is with regard to this <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Abaye said: They taught </span>that they are all exempt from the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> in a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where </span>the hides <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">were mixed up together only after the sprinkling </span>of the blood on the altar, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for at the time </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the blood </span>of each of the other four animals <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sprinkled, </span>each one of the four unblemished lambs <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was, at </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">any rate, fit to be eaten, </span>and therefore the owners are considered to have fulfilled their obligation to slaughter a fit Paschal lamb. As such, they are exempt from the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But if they were mixed up together before</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the sprinkling, </span>each of the five lambs could possibly be the blemished one. Because of the doubt that exists with regard to all of them, they are all disqualified from being offered. Therefore, none of the five people fulfill their obligation, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they are </span>all <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obligated to observe </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Pesaḥ</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span>", 
            "The Gemara comments: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The one who </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches </span>this statement of Abaye as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">referring to </span>the case in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the mishna, </span>where the disqualification is due only to a lack of awareness of which animals are registered for whom, but the animals themselves are inherently valid to be used, he would say that Abaye’s ruling applies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the more so to the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">baraita</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>where the disqualification is due to a blemish in the body of the animal itself. However, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the one who teaches </span>Abaye’s statement as referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to </span>the case in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">baraita</span> would say that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with regard to the mishna, no, </span>it does not apply. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since </span>both animals <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are </span>inherently <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">valid </span>to be used, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for if </span>the slave <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">remembers </span>which animal the master requested, each one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">will be fit to be eaten, </span>the following may be said: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is revealed before </span>God in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Heaven </span>which offering belongs to which person; the lack of awareness of this information does not impinge of the offerings’ validity, and therefore both the master and slave are exempt from the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>.", 
            "The Gemara returns to discuss the previously mentioned <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> concerning five people who offered Paschal lambs, and it was made clear that one of the lambs was invalid: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Master said: </span>All of them <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are exempt from observing </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">second </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Pesaḥ</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But there is one, </span>the owner of the lamb with the blemished hide, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who did not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fulfill </span>his obligation to bring a valid Paschal lamb. How then can all five be exempt?", 
            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Because it is not possible </span>to do otherwise; for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> should he do? Let each one </span>of the five <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bring a Paschal lamb. </span>This would not be a solution. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They would be bringing unconsecrated animals into the </span>Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">courtyard, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since four of them, </span>i.e., the owners of the unblemished lambs, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">have already </span>validly <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">performed </span>the ritual of the Paschal lamb. They are not obligated to bring another Paschal lamb; therefore, they are unable to consecrate another Paschal lamb. If they attempt to do so, the lamb remains unconsecrated and may not be brought into the Temple courtyard.", 
            "The Gemara suggests an alternative way for the five to ensure that they have all fulfilled their obligations: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> them all bring one Paschal lamb </span>as a unified group. The Gemara rejects this as well: This would also not be a solution. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It would turn out that the Paschal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> lamb was eaten by those who have not registered for</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it, </span>since one who has already fulfilled his obligation to bring a Paschal lamb is unable to be registered in a group formed in order to offer another one.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is this? </span>Surely a solution can be found by using the following stipulation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let each one</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> bring his Paschal lamb and stipulate and say: If mine</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was the blemished </span>lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that I am </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bringing now shall be a Paschal lamb, and if mine </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was unblemished, this </span>lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that I am bringing now shall </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be a peace-offering.</span>",

        ], 
        [
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because there are </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">breast and </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">hind leg, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which the priests eat </span>only if the offering is a peace-offering, but not if it is a Paschal lamb. Due to the distinction between the two types of offerings, the proposed stipulation does not provide a solution. It would remain unclear who should eat these portions of the offering.", 
            "The Gemara suggests that it may still be possible to find a way to use the stipulation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let each one </span>of these five people bringing a new Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bring a priest </span>to be registered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with him </span>for their Paschal lamb. Then the priest will eat the breasts and hind legs. Since the priest eats these portions of the offering in any event, there is no longer any practical distinction between the two types of offerings. The stipulation should therefore provide a solution.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> are the circumstances </span>of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this priest? If he had </span>already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">performed </span>the ritual of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Paschal lamb </span>during the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, then, as the Gemara explained previously, he is unable to be registered to partake of a new Paschal lamb. If so, there is concern that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">perhaps this </span>offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is a Paschal lamb </span>and not a peace-offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it will turn out </span>that a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Paschal lamb is eaten </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by those who did not register for it.

            "The Gemara identifies a further distinction between a peace-offering and the Paschal lamb that precludes the use of the stipulation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>the reason it is not possible to use the stipulation is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because it would reduce the </span>amount of time available for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eating the peace-offering, for a Paschal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> lamb </span>may be eaten only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for a day and a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> night, whereas a peace-offering </span>may be eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for two</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> days and one night. </span>Were the stipulation to be made, all the offerings would have an uncertain status of either being a peace-offering or a Paschal lamb. They would therefore all be treated with the strictures of a Paschal lamb, and any meat remaining on the morning after the first night would have to be burnt. However, in the event that the offering was actually a peace-offering, this would be premature, since it may still be eaten for another day.", 
            "The Gemara modifies the proposed stipulation: Instead of making a stipulation between a Paschal lamb and a regular peace-offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">let </span>each one of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">them </span>specify that if they have already fulfilled their obligations to bring a Paschal lamb, their intention is to consecrate and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">bring </span>the current offering as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a surplus Paschal lamb. </span>The status of a surplus Paschal lamb is usually achieved when an animal is originally consecrated as a Paschal lamb but for some reason is not offered. Such an animal is offered as a type of peace-offering.", 
            "The Gemara assumes here that it is also possible to consecrate an animal directly with this status, and therefore the following stipulation could be used. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>when bringing their lambs <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they should </span>each <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say: If mine was the blemished </span>lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that I am bringing now shall be</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a Paschal lamb; </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if mine was unblemished, this </span>lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that I am bringing now shall be a </span>surplus Paschal lamb, which is type of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">peace-offering </span>and may therefore be offered even if one has already fulfilled his obligation to bring a Paschal lamb. Although <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a surplus Paschal lamb</span> has the sanctity of a peace-offering, it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">may be</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> eaten for </span>only one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">day and one night</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> similar to a Paschal lamb. Since there is no distinction between the time allotted to eat the two types of offerings, this stipulation should provide a solution.", 
            "The Gemara challenges this suggestion: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But can we designate</span> animals <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">initially </span>as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">surplus </span>Paschal lambs? This cannot be done; the sanctity of a surplus Paschal lamb is achieved only with an animal that was initially designated for a Paschal lamb but remained unused. If so, how is the suggested stipulation tenable? The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let them trouble themselves </span>to find <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and bring </span>an unused leftover animal already invested with the sanctity of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a surplus Paschal lamb, </span>and let them make the suggested stipulation upon it.

Why may he nevertheless be registered for a Paschal lamb?

Why does this not permit him to be registered for a Paschal lamb? The Gemara answers: The reason a Paschal lamb may not be brought on his behalf is due to concern that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">perhaps he will be neglectful </span>and not immerse.

Perhaps it is referring specifically to one who is ritually impure from a corpse before the completion of his seven-day purification process and will therefore not be ritually pure that evening.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Yitzḥak, who said: </span>The ritually impure people in the desert asked Moses what they should do concerning their obligation to bring a Paschal lamb. It is about them that the verses pertaining to the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> were originally stated. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> were ritually impure from a corpse that had no one</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to bury it [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">met</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">mitzva</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their seventh day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> occurred on Passover eve, as it is stated: “They could</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not perform the Paschal lamb on that day” </span>(Numbers 9:6).

            "The Gemara presents a challenge from the mishna to the opinion of Rav that a Paschal lamb may not be offered on behalf of someone who is ritually impure from a creeping animal: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">We learned </span>in the mishna: In the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> who saw two sightings </span>of gonorrheal discharge, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one slaughters </span>the Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on his behalf </span>if Passover eve is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on his seventh </span>day. The Gemara suggests: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What, is it not </span>referring to a case in which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he has not </span>yet <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed </span>in a ritual bath, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>we may therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">learn from it that we </span>also may <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter and sprinkle on behalf of one who is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritually impure from a creeping animal, </span>since his level of impurity is identical to a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who saw two sightings?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">No, </span>the mishna is referring to a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who </span>already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed. </span>But <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if he </span>already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed, what is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it teaching us? </span>Since he will become ritually pure upon nightfall, surely it is obvious that a Paschal lamb may be offered on his behalf. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It teaches us this: That</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> even though he </span>still <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lacks the setting of the sun</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>a Paschal lamb may nevertheless be brought on his behalf. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It </span>therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches us that </span>since <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the sun sets</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> by itself, </span>and no action of his own is required to complete his purification process, the fact that he currently has still not completed his purification process does not disqualify him.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">So too, it is reasonable </span>to establish the mishna as referring to a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who had already immersed, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the fact <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that the last clause </span>of the mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught: </span>With regard to a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">saw three sightings, one slaughters </span>the Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on his </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">behalf on the eighth </span>day. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Granted, if you say </span>that the first clause, which states: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who saw two sightings, one slaughters on his behalf on </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the seventh day, </span>is referring to a case in which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he </span>had already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed, </span>then it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">necessary </span>to teach the last clause for the following reason:", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It could enter your mind to say that it is </span>true only with regard to a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">saw two </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sightings </span>and is now <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on his seventh </span>day, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for he</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>having already immersed, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does not lack </span>any <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">action; </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but </span>a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">saw three sightings </span>and is now <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on his eighth </span>day, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who lacks an action </span>in that he still <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lacks </span>his <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">atonement </span>offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">no, </span>a Paschal lamb may not be offered on his behalf. The last clause therefore must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teach us that although he </span>still <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lacks </span>his <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">atonement </span>offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one slaughters and sprinkles on his behalf.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But if you say </span>that the first clause, which states: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> who saw two sightings, </span>one slaughters on his behalf <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the seventh day, </span>is referring to a case in which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he </span>had <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not </span>already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed, </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">why do I </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">need </span>the last clause, which states: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> who saw three sightings, </span>one slaughters on his behalf <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the eighth day? </span>This clause could be logically deduced from the first one, as follows:", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Now, it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">can be said: </span>In the case of a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">saw two sightings </span>and is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on </span>his <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">seventh </span>day and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">has not </span>yet <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed, </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he is </span>therefore still <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">completely</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> impure, one </span>nevertheless <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughters and sprinkles </span>the Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> his behalf, </span>since he can become pure by the evening. So too, with regard to a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">saw</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> three </span>sightings and is now <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on </span>his <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eighth </span>day, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who has </span>already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed on the seventh </span>day, and his <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity </span>is therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">weakened </span>in that he does not impart impurity to that which he touches, despite the fact that he is still prohibited to enter the Temple or partake of offerings until he brings his atonement offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it not all the more so </span>true <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that one </span>should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter and sprinkle on his behalf? </span>Therefore, the last clause would be superfluous.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, must one not conclude from</span> the preceding analysis that the first clause, which states: With regard to a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">saw two sightings, </span>one slaughters on his behalf <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the seventh day, </span>is referring to a case in which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he </span>has already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immersed?</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">No, </span>one should not come to such a conclusion. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Actually, I can</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> say to you that </span>the mishna is referring to a case in which <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one did not </span>yet <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">immerse, and it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is necessary </span>to teach the last clause concerning a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who saw three sightings, because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it could enter your mind</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is </span>only for a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who saw two sightings that the Paschal lamb may be offered on his behalf <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the seventh, for it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">within his ability to remedy </span>the situation and purify himself by immersing in a ritual bath.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But</span> then, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the eighth </span>day of a <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> who saw three sightings, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when it is not within his ability </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to sacrifice </span>the necessary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering, </span>as he dependent upon the priests to do it for him, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say </span>that perhaps <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">priests will be negligent with him. </span>Perhaps his offering will not be brought, leaving him unfit for the Paschal lamb. Due to this concern, a Paschal lamb should not be offered on his behalf. The last clause therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches us </span>that there is no such concern, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in accordance with </span>the teaching of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Shemaya, </span>who maintains that the court of the priests may be relied upon with certainty.",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">With regard to what </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do they disagree? </span>The Gemara explains that they disagree about how to interpret the various verses that refer to the first and second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that the use of the word souls in the verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“According to the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> number of the souls</span>…you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4), includes everyone, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and even women, </span>in the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">if</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> so, even on the second </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, women should <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">also </span>be included, but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written </span>with regard to one who had not offered a Paschal lamb on the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> and then neglected to bring one on the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“That man shall bear his sin” </span>(Numbers 9:13), which indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a man, yes, </span>he is liable for not having brought a Paschal lamb on the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a woman, no, </span>she is not liable.",

The verse compares the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> to the second, and it is therefore <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">effective </span>to enable women to be included in a group in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a merely ancillary </span>manner.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Yosei, what is the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> reason </span>for his opinion? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it is written </span>with regard to the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“According to the number of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the souls,” </span>which includes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even a woman.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon, </span>what is the reason for his opinion? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is written </span>in a verse concerning the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">man.” </span>This teaches that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a man, yes, </span>a Paschal lamb may be brought on his behalf alone, but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a woman</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, no.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And if you say </span>that according to this, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even on the second </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> women should be able to participate as part of a group, this is not correct, because <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Torah excludes </span>women from participating <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on the second </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is written: “That man</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> shall bear his sin.” </span>This indicates that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a man, yes</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">; a woman, no. From what </span>precisely does the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">exclude</span> women? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If </span>you say it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">obligation </span>to participate in the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, this cannot be. Since <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">now</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, on the first </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, a woman has <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">no </span>obligation, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the second </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is it necessary </span>to say that a woman is not obligated? This is obvious, since the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> exists only as a second opportunity for those who neglected to participate in the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, is it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not </span>clear that the verse excludes women <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>participating even in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an ancillary </span>fashion?",

According to your reasoning, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the fact <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that it is taught: And did not observe, </span>conclude <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> inference that had he wished, he </span>could have <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">observed </span>it. However, this is not possible, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as </span>the mishna states explicitly that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he unwittingly </span>forgot <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">or </span>was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prevented </span>due to circumstances <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">beyond his control </span>and was unable to observe the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>the mishna must be explained differently, as follows: Even though it does not say so explicitly, the mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is teaching </span>with the phrase: And he did not observe, the case of one who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">intentionally </span>refrained from observing the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> together <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with </span>the other cases in the mishna. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Here, too, </span>in the first part of the mishna, the phrase: And he did not observe, must be understood as including another category of people: It <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is teaching </span>the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an acute mourner, </span>i.e., one whose relative died that same day and has not yet been buried, together <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with the </span>other cases. The first part of the mishna includes three cases: One who was ritually impure, one who was on distant journey, and one who was an acute mourner. Therefore, it cannot be inferred that had he wished to observe the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, he could have done so.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ashi said: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The mishna is also precisely </span>formulated according to this interpretation, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it teaches: These are exempt from </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, but those </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are liable to </span>receive <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. To which </span>part of the mishna is this referring? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If we say </span>that this statement is referring <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to one who unwittingly </span>forgot <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and one who</span> was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prevented </span>due to circumstances <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">beyond his control, are one</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> who unwittingly </span>forgot <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and one </span>who was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">prevented </span>due to circumstances <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">beyond his control subject to </span>the punishment of <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">? </span>One is liable to receive <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span> only for performing a transgression intentionally. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, is it not </span>referring to the case of one who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">intentionally </span>refrained from observing the <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, which is included in the phrase in the latter clause: And he did not observe, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and to </span>the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">an acute mourner, </span>which is included in the parallel phrase in the first clause? These two categories of people are liable to receive <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span> if they fail to sacrifice the Paschal lamb on the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Naḥman </span>could have <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to you </span>in response: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Actually, </span>the mishna refers <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">only to </span>the case of one who <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">intentionally </span>refrains from observing the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> and not to the case of an acute mourner; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and by right</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it </span>should have <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught </span>this ruling with the expression: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> is liable, </span>in the singular. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>the reason <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that it</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> teaches </span>this ruling with the phrase: These <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are liable, </span>in the plural, is that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since the first clause </span>of the mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches </span>its ruling with the expression: These <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are exempt</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>in the plural, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the latter clause </span>also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">teaches </span>its ruling with the expression: Those <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are liable, </span>in the plural. Therefore, the phrase in the first clause: And did not observe the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, teaches that one on a journey has the option of observing the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> if he wishes. And the same phrase in the latter clause: And did not observe, comes to include the case of one who intentionally refrains from observing the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say </span>my opinion? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Akiva says: It is stated that </span>one who is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritually </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impure </span>on the first <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> observes the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it is stated </span>that one who is on a <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">distant journey </span>observes the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>; "

            "The <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> mentioned several types of ritually impure women who observe the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> rather than the first.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>all <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">three of them expounded the same</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> verse </span>to derive their opinions: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“But the man who </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is ritually pure, and is not on a journey, </span>and refrains from offering the Paschal lamb, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because [<span class=\"it-text\">ki</span>] he did not bring the offering of the Lord in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin” (Numbers 9:13). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">holds </span>that the verse should be understood as follows: The phrase: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And refrains from </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offering the Paschal lamb, </span>that soul <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shall be cut off,” </span>means <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that he did not participate </span>in the offering on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the first </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span>. In the continuation of the verse, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi understands the word <span class=\"it-text\">ki</span> to mean: If, as the word <span class=\"it-text\">ki</span> has various meanings, one of which is: If.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">learned </span>the meaning of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>phrase: “And he shall bear <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his sin,” </span>stated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">here</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>with regard to one who did not sacrifice the Paschal lamb, by way of a verbal analogy <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the phrase: “Shall bear <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">his sin” </span>stated <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there, </span>with regard to the blasphemer. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Just as later, </span>with regard to the blasphemer, it is referring to the punishment of <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, so </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">too here, </span>with regard to the Paschal lamb, it is referring to the punishment of <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">karet</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>This concludes the Gemara’s explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.",

            "It was taught in the mishna that the Paschal lamb on <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the first </span><span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">requires </span>the recitation of <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">hallel</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is eaten, </span>whereas on the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> it does not.

            "The <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> continues: The juxtaposition of these verses teaches that if the offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is eaten </span>only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by </span>people who are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritually pure, </span>ritually impure people are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">liable for </span>eating <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">due to </span>being <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritually impure, but if it is not </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eaten </span>only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by </span>people who are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritually pure, </span>because it was offered when the majority of the Jewish people were impure, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">those who are ritually impure are not liable </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span>eating <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it due to </span>being <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impure.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>One <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought that if <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zavim</span> or lepers <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">pushed </span>their way in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and entered the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">courtyard, </span>which they are prohibited from entering, in order to sacrifice <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Paschal lamb that is brought </span>when the majority of the Jewish people are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>a state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity, </span>one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they would be liable </span>to receive <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span> for entering the Temple while ritually impure; therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: “That they send out from the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">camp any leper and any </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and anyone defiled by </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the dead” </span>(Numbers 5:2). This teaches that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">at a time</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> when those who are impure </span>due to ritual impurity imparted by <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a corpse are sent out </span>from the Temple, <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zavim</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and lepers are </span>also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sent out; </span>when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">those who are</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> impure </span>due to ritual impurity imparted by <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a corpse are</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not sent out </span>but are permitted to sacrifice the offering in a state of ritual impurity, <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">zavim</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and lepers are</span> also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not sent out.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Yosef asked </span>a question related to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> discussed above: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If those who are impure </span>due to ritual impurity imparted by <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a corpse pushed </span>their way in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and entered</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the Sanctuary</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> which is an area in which no services are performed for the Paschal lamb and which only priests may enter <span class=\"it-text\">ab</span> <span class=\"it-text\">initio</span>, and this occurs in a case in which the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Paschal lamb is brought </span>when the majority of the Jewish people are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in </span>a state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity, what is </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>? Is the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since ritual impurity was permitted in the courtyard </span>for the sake of the Paschal lamb, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity in the Sanctuary</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> was also permitted; or perhaps what was permitted was permitted</span> and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what was not permitted was not permitted, </span>and consequently, they are liable for entering the Sanctuary?", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said </span>in answer to this question that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: “They send out from the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> camp” </span>(Numbers 5:2); the phrase “from the camp” indicates that the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> applies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even </span>to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a part of the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> camp. </span>Therefore, when the majority of the Jewish people are ritually impure, even though people who are ritually impure are permitted to enter part of the Temple, as they must bring their offerings to the Temple courtyard, they are not permitted to enter everywhere inside the Temple, and the prohibition of entering the Sanctuary remains in place.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Some say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said </span>a different answer: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The verse states: “That they </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">send out from the camp </span>any leper and any <span class=\"it-text\">zav</span> and anyone defiled by the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">dead…outside the camp you</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> shall send them” </span>(Numbers 5:2–3). This implies that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">anywhere </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that we apply </span>the phrase: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Outside the camp you shall</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> send them,” </span>which is referring to a case in which the majority of the Jewish people are ritually pure and indicates that the impure people must be sent outside of the entire camp, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">we </span>also <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">apply </span>the phrase: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“They </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">must send out from the camp,” </span>meaning it is prohibited for people who are ritually impure to enter the Sanctuary. However, if the majority of the Jewish people are impure and the offering is sacrificed in a state of impurity, those who are impure are not liable if they enter the Sanctuary.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Yosef asked </span>a similar question: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If people who are</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> impure </span>due to ritual impurity imparted by <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a corpse pushed</span> their way in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and ate portions </span>that are supposed to be consumed on the altar, such as the fats, the kidneys, and the fat tail, from <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Paschal lam</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">b</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">offered in ritual impurity, </span>"
        ], 
        [
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what is </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span>? Are they liable for eating sacrificial meat while they were ritually impure? Do we say that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since ritual impurity of the meat </span>that is eaten <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was permitted, ritual impurity of the </span>sacrificial <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">portions </span>offered on the altar <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was also permitted; or perhaps </span>we say that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what was permitted was permitted, </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what was not permitted </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was not permitted?</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rava said: After all, from where </span>was the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> pertaining to eating the sacrificial <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">portions </span>in a state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">impurity included? </span>It is derived <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> with regard to eating the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">meat </span>in a state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is written: </span>“But the soul that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that pertain </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to the Lord, </span>having his ritual impurity upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:20); the apparently superfluous phrase “that pertain to the Lord” is there <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to include the </span>sacrificial <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">portions </span>and establish that one is liable to receive <span class=\"it-text\">karet</span> for eating these portions in a state of ritual impurity.", 
            "Since this is the source, there is a limitation to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> pertaining to sacrificial portions: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Anywhere</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that there is </span>liability <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span>eating the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">meat </span>in a state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity, there is </span>liability for eating the sacrificial <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">portions </span>in a state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity; </span>conversely, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">anywhere</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that there is no </span>liability for eating the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">meat </span>in a state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity, </span>such as in the case of a Paschal lamb offered in a state of ritual impurity, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there is no </span>liability for eating the sacrificial <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">portions </span>in a state of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ritual impurity</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Zeira asked: </span>With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span>sacrificial <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">portions of the Paschal lamb </span>that the Jewish people sacrificed in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Egypt </span>on the first Passover, just before they left Egypt, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where did they burn them? </span>The Torah does not say that they constructed an altar for this purpose. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Abaye said to him: </span>What place is there for such a question? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Who will tell us that </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they did not make them roaste</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> and eat them? The Jewish people had not yet been commanded with regard to the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of sacrifices; therefore, they presumably did not distinguish between meat and forbidden fats, and they roasted and consumed the entire animal (<span class=\"it-text\">Arukh</span>).", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And furthermore, Rav Yosef taught </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> were </span>three parts of the door upon which the blood was sprinkled that took the place of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">three altar</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there </span>in Egypt. The blood was applied <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">upon the lintel </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and upon the two doorposts; and there was nothing else. </span>Presumably, the Jewish people did not fulfill any mitzva not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, and since no other altar is mentioned, one can conclude that they did not offer the fats and other sacrificial portions on an altar.", 
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What </span>are the differences <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">between the Paschal lamb </span>that the Jewish people offered in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Egypt and the Paschal lamb </span>offered in all later <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">generations? The Paschal lamb </span>the Jewish people offered in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Egypt </span>had to be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taken from the tenth </span>of the month of Nisan <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and required </span>the people to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sprinkle </span>its blood <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">with a bundle of hyssop, </span>unlike the Paschal lamb in all later years, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>its blood was also sprinkled <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">upon the lintel and the two doorposts, and it was</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> eaten with </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">haste</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">;</span> in addition, the Paschal lamb in Egypt was only <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on one </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">night</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> whereas <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Paschal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> lamb </span>throughout the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">generations is observed for seven </span>days. ", 
            "The Gemara discusses the meaning of this difficult phrase, as obviously, the Paschal lamb is slaughtered on the fourteenth and eaten on the evening of the fifteenth. <strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From where do we </span>conclude that the requirements of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt do not apply to later generations? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As it is written: “Speak to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> all the congregation of Israel, saying: On the tenth day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of this month they shall take </span>to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, a lamb for a household” (Exodus 12:3); and we derive from the superfluous word “this” that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>Paschal lamb offered in Egypt had to be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taken from the tenth </span>of Nisan, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Paschal lamb of </span>later <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">generations is not taken from the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> tenth </span>of Nisan.", 
            "The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, if </span>that is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so, </span>when the verse states later in the same section: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And you shall keep it </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">until the fourteenth day of this month” </span>(Exodus 12:6), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> too </span>it should be inferred that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>Paschal lamb in Egypt <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">requires examination four days prior to </span>its <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter, and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> no other </span>offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">requires examinatio</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">n</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> four days prior to </span>its <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ben Bag Bag says: From where </span>do we know that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the daily offering requires examination four </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">days prior to </span>its <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter? It is stated </span>with regard to the daily offering: “Command the children of Israel, and say to them: My food which is presented to Me for offerings made by fire, of a sweet flavor to Me, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you shall safeguard it to sacrifice to Me in </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">its due season” </span>(Numbers 28:2), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it states there, </span>with regard to the Paschal lamb: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And it shall be </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for you as a safeguard until the fourteenth day of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this month” </span>(Exodus 12:6). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Just as </span>in the verse <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>the Paschal lamb <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">requires examination four days prior to </span>its <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter, so too here, </span>the daily offering <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">requires examination four</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> days prior to </span>its <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slaughter</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> There is no inference from the phrase “this month” that the requirement of examining an offering four days before is limited to the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt.", 
            "The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is different there, </span>with regard to the requirement to examine the daily offering four days prior to its slaughter, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is written: “You shall safeguard it.</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">”</span> This <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> is derived from a verbal analogy based the word “safeguard,” which is stated in the context of both offerings.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Similarly, the Paschal lamb </span>sacrificed in later <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">generations </span>also requires examination four days prior to slaughter, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is written: </span>“And it shall be when the Lord shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that you shall perform this service in this month” </span>(Exodus 13:5). From here it is derived <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that all the services</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of this month </span>for all later generations <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">shall be like</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> this, </span>including examination of the animal four days prior to sacrifice. Despite the fact that the verse connects the Paschal lamb in later years to the Paschal lamb in Egypt, the requirement to take the animal on the tenth of Nisan applied only on the first Passover.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>what does <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>phrase: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“this </span>month,” stated with regard to the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt, come to exclude? The Gemara answers that it comes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> exclude </span>the Paschal lamb of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the second </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Pesaḥ</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which is similar to it, </span>as it is also limited to a one day celebration. The Paschal lamb of the second <span class=\"it-text\">Pesaḥ</span> does not require examination four days prior to its slaughter.", 
            "Once again the Gemara questions its assertion that the phrase “this month” stated in the context of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt indicates that its <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> are not relevant to other offerings. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">However, if </span>that is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>with regard to that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which is written: “And they shall</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> eat the meat on that night” </span>(Exodus 12:8), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">so </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">too, </span>should it be inferred that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>Paschal lamb offered in Egypt <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was eaten at night and no other </span>Paschal lamb offered in later generations must <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">be eaten at night? </span>The Gemara answers that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: “You shall perform </span>this <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">service </span>in this month” (Exodus 13:5), in order to teach that the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt apply to later generations as well.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>if so, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">why do I </span>need the word <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“this” </span>stated with regard to the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt if all the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> relevant to that offering apply to the Paschal lambs of later generations? The Gemara answers that the phrase is needed <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span>the derivations cited by <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and Rabbi Akiva </span>(see <span class=\"it-text\">Berakhot</span> 9a) with regard to the length of time during which the Paschal lamb may be eaten.",

The Gemara answers: We cannot prove anything from here, as a case where one <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">does not have </span>an additional cup <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is different. </span>One who has two cups of wine is required to recite Grace after Meals over one of the cups and <span class=\"it-text\">havdala</span> over the other one.",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They say </span>in answer to this question: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From </span>the fact that Rav <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did not say </span>that one recites the blessing for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">time, </span>Who has given us life [<span class=\"it-text\">sheheḥiyanu</span>], sustained us, and brought us to this time, this proves <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">by inference that we are dealing</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> with the seventh </span>day <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Passover, </span>which is the only Festival day on which one does not recite the blessing for time.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects the previous explanation in favor of the following: <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">Havdala</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">kiddush</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> are one</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> matter</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> as they both mark and draw attention to the sanctity of certain days.

The same should hold true in our case: Just as <span class=\"it-text\">kiddush</span> is not considered an interruption between the blessing over wine and its consumption, Grace after Meals should not be considered an interruption either.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And that is not so. There, </span>when one is preparing himself to recite Grace after Meals, he has already <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">uprooted his min</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from drinking.

In other words, as Rav Sheshet maintained that the reason one may not eat on Passover eve is to prevent him from being distracted from preparing the Paschal lamb, and he also maintained that the Paschal offering may be sacrificed during the entire day of the fourteenth of Nisan, therefore, he would not eat that entire day.",

However, if there is more of the stringent material, the two substances do not combine halakhically to form the amount of the smaller requisite size.

            "The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is necessary only </span>to teach that this <span class=\"it-text\">halakha</span> applies <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Akiva, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who said: Make your Shabbat </span>like an ordinary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">weekda</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">y</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> do not be beholden to </span>other <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">beings. </span>If one is unable to honor Shabbat without financial help from others, it is better for him to save money and eat his Shabbat meals as he would on a weekday rather than rely on other people. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Here, </span>in the case of the four cups, Rabbi Akiva <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">concedes </span>that it is appropriate for a poor person to request assistance from the community, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">due</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> to </span>the obligation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to publicize the miracle.</span>", 
            "With regard to this issue, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the school of Eliyahu taught </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although Rabbi Akiva</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said: Make your Shabbat </span>like <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a weekday and do </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not be beholden to </span>other <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">beings; however, one </span>should nevertheless <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">perform some small </span>alteration <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in his house </span>to distinguish Shabbat from a weekday. The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What </span>is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>alteration? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Pappa said: </span>For example, one should serve <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">small, fried </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fish. As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehuda ben </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Teima says: Be bold like a leopard, light like an </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eagle, run like a deer, and </span>be <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">strong like a </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">lion to perform the will of your Father in Heaven. </span>This statement teaches that one should exert every effort to perform a mitzva.", 
            "The Gemara cites the full source of Rabbi’s Akiva statement with regard to Shabbat preparations. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The Sages </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught: Rabbi Akiva commanded Rabbi Yehoshua, his son, </span>about <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">seven </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matters: My son, do not sit at the high point </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of a city, </span>where many people pass, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and stud</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">y</span> there, as the passersby will interrupt you. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And do not live</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in a city whose leaders are Torah scholars</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> as they are too busy studying to govern properly.",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Pappa said </span>in explanation of this last statement: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Do not buy from him and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> do not sell to him. </span>If he is the beneficiary of good fortune, he will profit from any business transaction and you will suffer from it. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, form a partnership</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> with him.

This means that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">anyone who took </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">peruta</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> from Job would be blessed, </span>even if he received it via a business transaction. This shows that one should engage in business with a person who is blessed, for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even if </span>he wishes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to buy from him or </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to sell to him it is well, </span>i.e., he will share in the good fortune of the other.", 
            "The Gemara continues to cite similar advice dispensed by Rabbi Akiva. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Akiva commanded Rabbi Shimon ben Yo</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">ḥai </span>to do <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">five matters when </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was imprisoned</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>Beforehand, Rabbi Shimon <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said to him: Rabbi, teach me Torah</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said </span>to him: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">I will not teach you</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>as it is dangerous to do so at the present time.

Rabbi Akiva <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said: My son</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>know that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">more than the calf wishes to suck, the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> cow wants to suckle, </span>but I am afraid of the danger.

            "Rabbi Akiva further told Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Do not cook in a pot in which your colleague </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">cooked </span>his food. The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is </span>the meaning of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">this </span>statement? The Gemara explains: Rabbi Akiva is referring to marrying <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a divorced woman in the lifetime of her</span> former <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">husband. As the Master said: </span>If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a divorced man</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> marries a divorced woman</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> there are four minds in</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the bed </span>during intimacy.

Furthermore, it is possible that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">anything you</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> sell </span>might later cause you to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">regret </span>the sale, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">except for wine, which you </span>can <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">sell without regret. </span>Since wine might go bad and be entirely lost, its sale is always advisable.",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Yehuda said </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Shmuel said: The song in the Torah</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>i.e., the Song at the Sea (Exodus 15:1–19), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Moses</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and the Jewish people recited it when they ascended from</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the sea. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And who said this </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">hallel</span> mentioned in the mishna, Psalms 113–118?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Meir would say: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">All the praises stated in the book of Psalms were </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">recited by David, as it is stated: “The prayers of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">David, son of Yishai, are ended [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">kalu</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">]” </span>(Psalms 72:20). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Do</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not read </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">kalu</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">; rather, </span>read <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">kol</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">elu</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> all of</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> these, </span>which indicates that the entire book of Psalms consists of the prayers of King David.", 
            "The Gemara clarifies: According to those who dispute Rabbi Meir’s claim that the entire book of Psalms was composed by King David, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">who </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">recited this </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">hallel</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">? Rabbi Yosei says: My son Elazar says</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Moses and the Jewish people recited it when they</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> ascended from the sea. And his colleagues dispute him, saying</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that it was recited by </span>King <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">David. And the statement</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of </span>my son, Elazar, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">appears </span>more accurate <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">than their statement</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">. </span>The reason is as follows: Is it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">possible that the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Jewish people slaughtered their Paschal lambs and took </span>and waved <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">their </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">lulavim</span> all those generations <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">without reciting a song? </span>Rather, the Jews must have recited a song each year. Since it is the custom to sing <span class=\"it-text\">hallel</span> nowadays, it is evidently an ancient institution.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Alternatively, </span>is it possible that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Micah’s idol stood</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in tears</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and the Jewish people </span>were <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">reciting </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">hallel</span> before it? The reference is to the idol of Micah, which was still standing in the days of David (see Judges 17). The Gemara states that the idol was crying, as a euphemism for its laughter, to avoid shaming the Jewish people (<span class=\"it-text\">g</span><span class=\"it-text\">e’onim</span>). The point is that the Jews would not have chanted: “They who make them shall be like them” (Psalms 115:8) at a time that they were worshipping idols. Rather, <span class=\"it-text\">hallel</span> must be older than that, and it dates back to the Song at the Sea.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Sages taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> that with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the songs and praise that David recite</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> in the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">book of Psalms, Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>David <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said them about </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">himself. </span>They were the praises of an individual that were later transmitted to the community. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yehoshua says: He </span>originally <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said them about the community. </span>He composed all of the psalms for the people, including those he wrote about himself. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And the Rabbis say: There are among these </span>psalms some that are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">about the community, and there are among these </span>psalms some that are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">about himself. </span>The Rabbis clarify their opinion: The psalms <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that are stated in the singular </span>form are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">about himself, </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">those stated in the plural </span>form are <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">about the community.</span>",

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">We </span>would have been <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">fortunate had we remained under the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">first </span>decree and were still able to eat the herbs of the field. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And we still have not </span>entirely <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">escaped </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from </span>this decree, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as we </span>sometimes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">eat the grass of </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the field, </span>in the form of vegetables and leaves.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Sheizvi said, citing Rabbi </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Elazar ben Azarya: </span>The task of providing <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a person’s </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">food is as difficult as the splitting of the Red </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Sea</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> as it is written: “He gives food to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all flesh, </span>for His mercy endures forever” (Psalms 136:25), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">juxtaposed to it is </span>the verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“To Him who divided</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the Red Sea in sunder, </span>for His mercy endures forever” (Psalms 136:13). The reiteration of the last part of the verse indicates that the two praises are to a certain extent equivalent.", 
            "Likewise, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Elazar ben</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Azarya said: A person’s orifices, </span>when he cannot properly relieve himself, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are as difficult </span>for him <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as the day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of death and the splitting of the Red Sea, as</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it is stated: “He who is bent down shall speedily</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be loosed; </span>and he shall not go down dying into the pit, neither shall his bread fail” (Isaiah 51:14). The phrase “dying into the pit” indicates that the opening of the orifices is similar to a rescue from death. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> afterward it is written: “Who stirs up the sea, that</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> its waves roar” </span>(Isaiah 51:15), which compares the previous matter to the splitting of the sea.", 
            "After citing a statement of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya that was transmitted by <span class=\"it-text\">amora’</span><span class=\"it-text\">im</span>, the Gemara quotes additional expositions attributed to him. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Sheshet said, citing Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: Anyone who </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">disparages the Festivals</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> it is </span>considered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as though he </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">engages in idol worship. </span>This, too, is derived from the juxtaposition of verses, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is stated: “You shall make </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">yourself no molten gods” </span>(Exodus 34:17), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and afterward it is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> written: “The Festival of </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">matzot</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> you shall keep” </span>(Exodus 34:18), from which it can be inferred that anyone who does not observe the Festivals properly is likened to one who fashions idols.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rav Sheshet </span>further <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said, citing Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: Anyone who speaks slander, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and anyone who accepts </span>and believes the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">slander </span>he hears, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and anyone who testifies falsely about another, it is fitting </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to throw him to the dogs, as it is stated: </span>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you shall cast it to</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the dogs” </span>(Exodus 22:30), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and afterward it is written: “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">You shall not utter [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">tisa</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] a false report; </span>put not your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness” (Exodus 23:1).
