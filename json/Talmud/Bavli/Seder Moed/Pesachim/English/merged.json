            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>On the evening [</b><b><i>or</i></b><b>] of </b><b>the </b><b>fourteent</b><b>h</b> of the month of Nisan, <b>one searches for</b><b> leavened </b><b>brea</b><b>d</b> in his home <b>by candlelight. Any place </b><b>into which one does not </b>typically <b>take leavened bread does </b><b>not require a search, </b>as it is unlikely that there is any leavened bread there. <b>And with regard to what </b>the Sages of previous generations meant when they <b>said </b>that one must search <b>two rows </b>of wine barrels <b>in a </b><b>cellar, </b>i.e., <b>a place into which one </b>typically <b>takes </b>some <b>leavened bread, </b>the early <i>tanna’im</i> are in dispute. <b>Beit Shammai say </b>that this is referring to searching the first <b>two rows across the entire cellar, and Beit Hillel </b><b>say: </b>There is no need to search that extensively, as it is sufficient to search <b>the two external rows, which </b><b>are the upper ones. </b>This dispute will be explained and illustrated in the Gemara.", 
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is </b>the meaning of the term <b><i>or</i></b><b>, </b>translated as: The evening of? The Gemara provides two answers. <b>Rav Huna said: </b>It means <b>light, and Rav Yehuda </b><b>said: </b>In this context, it means <b>evening. </b>At first glance, <b>it </b>could <b>enter your mind </b>to suggest that <b>the one </b><b>who said light </b>means that one searches for leaven by the <b>actual light </b>of day, on the morning of the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>and the one who said evening </b>is referring to the <b>actual evening </b>of the fourteenth.", 
            "To clarify the meaning of the word <i>or</i>, the Gemara analyzes biblical verses and rabbinic statements. The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>from a verse: <b>“As soon as the morning was </b><b><i>or</i></b><b>, the</b><b> men were sent away, </b>they and their donkeys” (Genesis 44:3). <b>Apparently, </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> is day. </b>The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>Is it written: The light was morning? “The morning was</b><b> light” is written. </b>In this context, <i>or</i> is a verb not a noun, <b>as the one who said: </b>The <b>morning</b><b> lightened. And </b>this is <b>in accordance with </b>that which <b>Rav</b><b> Yehuda said </b>that <b>Rav said, as Rav Yehuda said </b>that <b>Rav said: A person </b>should <b>always enter </b>an unfamiliar city <b>with “it is good” </b>(Genesis 1:4), i.e., before sunset, while it is light, as the Torah uses the expression “it is good” with regard to light upon its creation. This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And </b>likewise, when one leaves a city <b>he </b>should <b>leave with “it is </b><b>good,” </b>meaning after sunrise the next morning.", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>from another verse: <b>“And</b><b> as the light [</b><b><i>or</i></b><b>] of the morning, when the sun</b><b> rises, </b>a morning without clouds; when through clear shining after rain the tender grass springs out of the earth” (II Samuel 23:4). <b>Apparently, </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> is day. </b>The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>Is it written </b>that <b>the light</b><b> was morning? “As the light of the morning” is written</b><b>, and this is </b>what the verse <b>is saying: And as</b> brightly as <b>the morning light of this world </b>shines at its peak, <b>so will be the rising of the sun</b><b> for the righteou</b><b>s</b><b> in the World-to-Come, </b>as in those days the light of the sun will be seven times stronger than at present (see Isaiah 30:26).", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection: “And God called the </b><b><i>or</i></b> <b>Day, </b>and the darkness He called Night” (Genesis 1:5). <b>Apparently,</b> <b><i>or</i></b><b> is day. </b>The Gemara rejects this proof as well. <b>This is </b>what the verse <b>is saying: </b>God <b>called</b><b> the advancing light Day. </b>As stated previously, the word <i>or</i> can also be a verb; in this context, God called the beginning of that which eventually brightens, Day. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>However, if </b>that <b>is so, </b>the continuation of the verse, <b>“and the darkness He called Night</b><b>,” </b>should be understood to mean: <b>He called the advancing darkness</b><b> Night, </b>even before it is actually dark. However, this cannot be the correct interpretation of the verse, <b>as we maintain</b><b> it is day until the emergence of the stars. </b>Since the stars emerge only after the sky begins to darken, the advancing evening cannot be defined as part of the night.", 
            "The Gemara rejects the previous explanation. <b>Rather, this</b><b> is what </b>the verse <b>is saying: God called the </b><b>light </b>to come <b>and commanded it </b>to perform <b>the mitzva </b><b>of the day</b><b>,</b><b> and God called the night and </b><b>commanded it </b>to perform <b>the mitzva of the night. </b>Called, in this context, does not connote the giving of a name. It means that He instructed the day and night to carry out their characteristic functions.", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection: </b>“Praise Him, sun and moon; <b>praise </b><b>Him, all the stars of </b><b><i>or</i></b><b>” </b>(Psalms 148:3). <b>Apparently, </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> is </b>the <b>evening, </b>as the stars of light appear at night. The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>This is </b>what the verse <b>is saying: Praise Him, all the stars that </b><b>radiate, </b>as in this context <i>or</i> is not a noun but rather a verb that describes the activity of the stars. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>However, if </b>that <b>is </b><b>so, </b>does the verse mean that <b>it is </b>the <b>stars </b><b>that radiate that are required to praise </b>God, whereas those <b>that do not radiat</b><b>e</b> light<b> are not required to praise </b>Him? <b>But isn’t it written </b>in the previous verse: <b>“Praise Him, all His legions,” </b>indicating that all stars should praise God?", 
            "<b>Rather, this</b> phrase, the stars of light, comes to <b>teach us</b><b> that the light of stars is also </b>considered <b>light. </b>The Gemara asks: <b>What </b>is the <b>practical difference </b>that emerges from the fact that the light of the stars is classified as light? The Gemara answers: It is significant with regard <b>to one who vows </b>that he will derive no benefit <b>from light. </b>It is necessary to define precisely what is included in the term light. <b>As we learned </b>in a mishna: For <b>one who vows </b>that he will derive no benefit <b>from light</b><b>,</b><b> it is prohibited to </b>benefit even from <b>the light of </b>the <b>stars.</b>", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection:</b><b> “A murderer rises with the </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> to kill the </b><b>poor and needy; and in the night he is as </b><b>a thief” </b>(Job 24:14). "

        [
            "<b>From </b>the fact <b>that </b>the end of the verse <b>states: “And in the </b><b>night he is as a thief,” apparently </b>the word <b><i>or</i></b> at the beginning of the verse <b>is </b>a reference to <b>day, </b>as the verse contrasts between night and <i>or</i>. The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>There, this is </b>what the verse <b>is saying: If </b>the <b>matter is as clear to you </b><b>as light, that </b>the thief has <b>come </b>into the house prepared to take <b>a life, </b>he <b>is a murderer; and </b>the owner of the house <b>may save himself by </b>taking the <b>life </b>of the intruder. In that case, one may protect himself from a thief who breaks into his house, even by killing the intruder if necessary. <b>And if the</b><b> matter is as unclear to you as the night, he</b><b> should be </b>nothing more <b>than a thief in your eyes</b> and not a murderer; and therefore <b>one may not save</b><b> himself by </b>taking the <b>life </b>of the thief. This verse is not referring to actual day and night; rather, it uses these terms as metaphors for certainty and uncertainty.", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>to the opinion that <i>or</i> means evening: <b>“Let the stars of the twilight be</b><b> dark; let it look for </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> but have none; neither</b><b> let it see the eyelids of the morning” </b>(Job 3:9). <b>From </b>the fact <b>that </b>the verse <b>states: “Let it </b><b>look for </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> but have none,” apparently </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> is day. </b>The Gemara rejects this contention. Actually, it is possible that <i>or</i>, in this context, means light in general, not specifically day. <b>There, Job is cursing his fortune. He said: Let </b><b>it be </b>His <b>will that this man, </b>referring to himself, <b>will seek light and not find it.</b>", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection: “And I say, yet the</b><b> darkness shall envelop me, and the </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> about me shall</b><b> be night” </b>(Psalms 139:11). <b>Apparently, </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> is day. </b>The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>This is </b>what <b>David is saying </b><b>there: I said </b>after I sinned that <b>darkness shall envelop </b><b>me in the World-to-Come, which is like day. </b><b>Now </b>that I know that I have been forgiven, even <b>this world, which is like darkness, </b>is <b>light for me. </b>That being the case, it cannot be derived from here that the word <i>or</i> describes the day.", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>from a mishna. <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b><b> says: One searches </b>on <b><i>or</i></b><b> of the fourteenth </b>of Nisan, <b>on the fourteenth </b>in the <b>morning, and at the </b><b>time of </b>the <b>removal </b>of leavened bread. The Gemara infers from Rabbi Yehuda’s teaching: <b>From </b>the fact <b>that Rabbi</b><b> Yehuda says </b>that <b>one searches </b>on <b><i>or</i></b><b> of the fourteenth</b><b> and on the fourteenth </b>in the <b>morning, apparently </b><b><i>or</i></b><b> is</b> the <b>evening. </b>In the order of Rabbi Yehuda’s list, <i>or</i> of the fourteenth precedes the morning of the fourteenth. Therefore, <i>or</i> must be referring to the evening. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it </b>that this is the case.", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>from a different source: <b>From when </b>on <b>the fourteenth </b>of Nisan <b>is </b>it <b>prohibited to perform labor, </b>for those who are accustomed not to work of Passover eve? <b>Rabbi </b><b>Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: From the time of </b><b><i>or</i></b><b>. </b><b>Rabbi Yehuda says: From sunrise.</b>", 
            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov said to Rabbi </b><b>Yehuda: And where have we found </b>precedent for <b>a day, </b>in <b>part of which the performance of labor </b>is <b>prohibited, </b><b>and </b>in another <b>part of which the performance of labor </b>is <b>permitted</b><b>?</b> If, as you claim, the prohibition against performing labor takes effect only from sunrise, whereas the fourteenth of Nisan begins with the emergence of stars the previous evening, it is permitted to perform labor during the first part of the fourteenth, while during the second part of the same day labor is prohibited. <b>He said to him: </b>The fourteenth day <b>itself </b>can <b>prove </b>to be a precedent, <b>as </b>in <b>part of it, </b>from the beginning until the sixth hour of the day, <b>the eating of leavened bread</b> is <b>permitted, and </b>during another <b>part of it the eating</b><b> of leavened bread </b>is <b>prohibited.</b>", 
            "With regard to the matter under discussion, the Gemara infers: <b>From </b>the fact <b>that Rabbi Yehuda</b><b> says </b>that it is prohibited to perform labor <b>from sunrise</b><b>, apparently </b>the word <b><i>or</i></b><b> that Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b><b> is saying, is </b>referring to the <b>evening. </b>This is an additional proof that <i>or</i> means night. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>No, </b>this is not a proof. <b>What is </b>meant by <b><i>or</i></b><b>? </b>It means <b>dawn. </b>The dispute of the <i>tanna</i><i>’im</i> is not whether the prohibition of labor begins at night or in the morning. Rather, they disagree as to whether labor is prohibited from dawn or only from sunrise.", 
            "The Gemara challenges this assumption: <b>If so</b><b>, </b>consider that <b>which </b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Where have we found </b>precedent for <b>a </b><b>day, </b>in <b>part of which the performance of labor </b>is <b>prohibited, and </b>in another <b>part of which the performance of </b><b>labor </b>is <b>permitted? Let him say to himself: Isn’t </b><b>there </b>the <b>night, </b>during <b>which </b>even <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’</b><b>akov </b>himself <b>permits </b>performance of labor at night? He certainly would not raise a difficulty against the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, which is equally difficult according to his own opinion.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this contention. <b>This is </b>what Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <b>is saying: Granted, </b>according <b>to my </b>opinion, <b>I</b><b> find </b>situations in <b>which the Sages distinguished between </b>the <b>day</b><b> and </b>the preceding <b>night, as we learned </b>in a mishna <b>with regard to </b>a lenient <b>communal fast: Until when </b>may <b>one eat and drink </b>before the fast? It is permitted to eat and drink <b>until dawn</b><b>;</b> this is <b>the</b><b> statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.

In that case, the Sages distinguished between day and night. <b>However, according to your </b>opinion, <b>where do </b><b>we find </b>a <i>halakha</i> with regard to which <b>the Sages </b><b>divided the day itself?</b>", 
            "Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to </b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov: The day of the fourteenth <b>itself</b><b> can prove </b>my opinion, <b>as </b>during <b>part of it, the</b><b> eating of leavened bread </b>is <b>permitted, and </b>during <b>part of</b><b> it the eating of leavened bread </b>is <b>prohibited. </b>The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Yehuda has spoken well to Rabbi Eliezer; </b>how can Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov counter this contention? The Gemara answers that <b>this is </b>what <b>Rabbi Eliezer is </b><b>saying to him </b>in response: <b>I said to you </b>the prohibition of <b>labor, </b>which is <b>by rabbinic law, and you</b><b> said to me </b>the prohibition of <b>leavened bread, which is</b><b> by Torah law. </b>With regard to a Torah prohibition, it is possible <b>that until this </b>point, <b>God prohibited </b>doing so, <b>and until that </b>point, <b>God permitted </b>doing so, as the <i>halakha</i> is determined by a Torah decree.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>what is the response of <b>the other </b>Sage, Rabbi Yehuda, to this contention? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda notes that the <b>hours </b>when the prohibition of leaven is in effect on the morning of the fourteenth are determined <b>by rabbinic law. </b>Despite the fact it is prohibited by Torah law to eat leaven from midday, the distinction within the morning hours between the time when one may consume leaven and the time when one may derive benefit from leaven but not consume it is determined by the Sages. Apparently, the Sages institute ordinances that apply to part of a day.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>how can <b>the other </b>Sage, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov would say that in this case <b>the Sages established a preventive measure for a Torah</b><b> law, </b>and decrees of this type are at times in effect for only part of the day. However, when the Sages instituted independent ordinances, they invariably did so for entire twenty-four hour periods.

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b><b>: </b>The court messengers <b>kindle torche</b><b>s</b> on the mountaintops as a signal that the court has sanctified and established a new month <b>only for a month that appeared at its</b> proper <b>time, </b>on the thirtieth day of the previous month, <b>to sanctify it </b>on that day. <b>And when do </b>the messengers <b>kindle </b>these <b>torches? </b>They light them on <b><i>or</i></b><b> of</b><b> its additional </b>day, at the end of the thirtieth day from the beginning of the previous month, leading into the evening of the thirty-first day.

            "from a mishna that deals with to the offering of <b>a woman who miscarries </b>on <b><i>or</i></b><b> of the eighty-firs</b><b>t</b> day after her previous childbirth: The Torah obligates a woman to bring an offering after childbirth, including a miscarriage. However, one offering suffices for any births or miscarriages that occur within eighty days of the original birth, as the halakhic ramifications of that birth last eighty days (see Leviticus 12:1–6). The mishna cited addresses the borderline case of a woman who miscarries on the night of the eighty-first day following the birth. <b>Beit Shammai exempt </b>her <b>from </b>bringing another <b>offering, </b>as the offering she brought for the previous childbirth exempts her from bringing another for the miscarriage. <b>And Beit Hillel obligate </b>her to bring a second offering.", 
            "<b>Beit Hillel said</b><b> to Beit Shammai: What is different </b>between <b><i>or</i></b><b> of the</b><b> eighty-first and the day of the eighty-first?

To avoid using the three-letter word <i>tameh</i>, the verse employs the nineteen-letter phrase “he is not ritually pure; surely he is not ritually pure,” spelled: <i>Beit</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>tav</i>, <i>yod</i>; <i>tet</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>reish</i>; <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>alef</i>; <i>kaf</i>, <i>yod</i>; <i>lamed</i>, <i>alef</i>; <i>tet</i>, <i>heh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>reish</i>.", 
            "Likewise, a <i>baraita</i> <b>was taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: A person should always</b><b> converse euphemistically</b><b>,</b><b> as </b>one finds in the following verses. The first: “And whichever saddle that the <i>zav</i> rides upon shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 15:9), which discusses the impurity imparted by <b>a </b><b><i>za</i></b><b><i>v</i></b> to an object on which he sits, <b>calls </b>this action <b>riding. And </b>the verse: “And anyone who touches anything on which she sat” (Leviticus 15:22), which discusses the parallel ritual impurity <b>of a woman, </b>a <i>zava</i>, <b>calls </b>the action <b>sitting. </b>Since riding is slightly demeaning for a woman, as it involves an immodest splaying of the legs, the verse avoids the term riding and opts to convey the more modest image of sitting. <b>And</b><b> it says </b>in another verse: <b>“And you choose the </b><b>language of the crafty” </b>(Job 15:5), meaning that one should be clever when speaking and avoid inappropriate phrases. <b>And it</b><b> says </b>in another verse: “My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; <b>and that which my lips </b><b>know they shall speak sincerely” </b>(Job 33:3).", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the need for the proofs from the two additional verses introduced by the phrase: <b>And it says? </b>The <i>baraita</i> already proved its point from the verses with regard to <i>zav</i> and <i>zava</i>. The Gemara answers: The additional verses are necessary, <b>lest you say: This </b>requirement to use clean language <b>applies only in </b>the language written in <b>the Torah, but </b><b>in rabbinic </b>formulations, <b>no, </b>there is no obligation to use clean language. To counter this argument, the <i>tanna</i> says, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: And it says: “And you choose the language</b><b> of the crafty,” </b>which indicates that this principle extends beyond the language of the Torah. <b>And lest you say that</b><b> this </b>requirement <b>applies only to rabbinic </b>language, <b>but </b>when it comes <b>to ordinary speech, no, </b>one need not speak euphemistically, the <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And it says: “And that which</b><b> my lips know they shall speak sincerely,” </b>i.e., one must speak euphemistically in every situation.", 
            "With regard to the above <i>baraita</i> taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael, the Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to a woman, is</b> the term <b>riding not written </b>in the Torah? <b>But isn</b><b>’t it written: “And Rebecca and her damsels arose and</b><b> they rode upon camels” </b>(Genesis 24:61)? The Gemara answers: <b>There, due to fear of camels, that is standard conduct. </b>Since a camel’s back is high off the ground, a woman cannot sit on it sidesaddle; consequently, she may ride on it without being considered immodest. The Gemara cites another relevant verse. <b>But isn’t it written: “And Moses </b><b>took his wife and his children and rode them upon </b><b>his donkey” </b>(Exodus 4:20)? The Gemara answers: <b>There, </b>despite the fact that his wife was also on the donkey, the verse employs the language of riding"

This verse employs the language of riding in reference to a woman on a donkey. The Gemara answers: <b>There, due to the fear of </b><b>the night, it is standard practice </b>for a woman to ride and not merely sit on the donkey. <b>And if </b><b>you wish, say </b>instead: <b>There is no </b>consideration <b>due to </b><b>the fear of the night </b>that would explain why she was permitted to ride in the regular manner; rather, <b>there </b><b>is </b>a consideration <b>due to fear of David.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>But </b><b>isn’t </b>the word <b>impure written in the Torah? </b>Apparently, the Torah does not consistently employ euphemisms, and indeed the word impure appears regularly. <b>Rather, anywhere that </b>two phrases <b>are</b><b> equal </b>in length, the verse <b>speaks </b>employing <b>a euphemism.

            "The Gemara relates an incident involving the use of appropriate language: There were <b>these two </b><b>students who were sitting before Rav </b>and were weary from studying a complex issue. <b>One </b>of them <b>said: This </b><b><i>halakha</i></b> we are studying <b>is rendering us </b>as tired <b>as a </b><b>tired [</b><b><i>mesankan</i></b><b>]</b><b> something else, </b>a euphemism for a pig. <b>And </b>the other <b>one said: This </b><b><i>halakha</i></b><b> is rendering us</b> as tired <b>as a tired kid.

            "<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: </b>With regard to a vessel that contains several loaves in which there was <b>bread that became moldy</b><b>,</b> and it is not evident whether it is leaven or <i>matza</i>, <b>once there was more </b><b><i>matza</i></b> than leaven in the vessel, it is <b>permitted. </b>The Gemara first analyzes the case itself: <b>What are the circumstances? If you say that</b><b> he knows that </b>this loaf <b>is leavened bread, </b>even if <b>there were more </b><b><i>matza</i></b><b>, what of </b>it? What difference does it make that most of the food is <i>matza</i>, if it is clear that this loaf is leaven?", 
            "<b>Rather, </b>Rav must be speaking of a case <b>where we </b><b>do not know whether it is leavened bread </b>or <b>whether </b><b>it is </b><b><i>matza</i></b><b>. </b>However, in that case, <b>why </b>discuss <b>specifically</b> a situation <b>where there was more </b><b><i>matza</i></b> in the vessel? <b>Even </b>in a case <b>where there was not more </b><b><i>matza</i></b> in the vessel <b>as well, </b>the questionable loaf is likely to be <i>matza</i>, as <b>let us follow the last</b> item placed in the vessel, which even on the first day of Passover would be <i>matza</i>.", 
            "<b>Didn’t we learn </b>in a mishna: With regard to <b>coins that were found before animal merchants </b>in Jerusalem, <b>they are always </b>assumed to be money of the second <b>tithe</b><b>,</b> as most of the animals purchased in Jerusalem were bought with that money. This <i>halakha</i> applies both during a Festival and throughout the year, as people would purchase animals for meat with their second-tithe money, and it can therefore be assumed that these coins have the status of second tithe. However, if the money was found <b>on</b><b> the Temple Mount </b>it is <b>non-sacred </b>money, even during a Festival. It can be assumed that one who enters the Temple Mount has already purchased all the animals that he required beforehand. Any coins in his possession are non-sacred money, not tithes.", 
            "If the money was found elsewhere <b>in Jerusalem during the Festival, </b>when many people came to Jerusalem with their second-tithe money, the coins are presumed to be second-<b>tithe </b>money. However, if the coins were found <b>during the rest of the </b><b>year, </b>it is <b>non-sacred </b>money.", 
            "The Gemara explains the proof. <b>And Rav </b><b>Shemaya bar Zeira said: What is the reason </b>that during the rest of the year the coins are considered non-sacred money, even on the day after the Festival? <b>Since </b><b>the markets of Jerusalem tend to be cleaned every day, </b>any money left there would already have been found by the street cleaners. Consequently, any coins found there were left there recently. <b>Apparently, we say </b>that <b>the first ones are</b><b> gone and these </b>objects <b>are later ones. Here too, </b>with regard to moldy bread, <b>let us say: The first ones</b> have been eaten and <b>are gone, and this </b>food <b>is</b><b> from now </b>and is undoubtedly <i>matza</i>.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: It is <b>different</b><b> here, as the mold proves about </b>the loaf that it is leaven, as food does not become moldy unless it has been sitting for a long time. The Gemara retorts: <b>If its mold proves about </b>the loaf that it is leaven, <b>if there was more </b><b><i>matza</i></b> in the vessel, <b>what</b><b> of </b>it? Even in that case, the very fact that it is moldy proves that it is leaven. <b>Rabba </b><b>said: Do not say there was more </b><b><i>matza</i></b> than leaven in the vessel; <b>rather, say that several days of </b>eating <b><i>matza</i></b><b> have passed over </b>the vessel. In other words, several days of the Festival, during which <i>matza</i> is consumed, have passed. Therefore, it is more likely that the moldy loaf is <i>matza</i>.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, </b>it is <b>obvious </b>that the moldy loaf is <i>matza</i>, not leaven. The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a situation where <b>its mold is extensive. Lest you say: Since its mold</b><b> is extensive the matter is revealed that it is certainly</b><b> leavened bread, </b>therefore Rav <b>teaches us </b>that one cannot be entirely sure that this is the case.", 
            "The Gemara explains the reason for the uncertainty. <b>Since several days of </b>eating <b><i>matza</i></b><b> have</b><b> passed over </b>the vessel, <b>we say: Each and every </b><b>day he baked warm loaves, which he placed upon </b>the previous days’ <i>matza</i>, causing <b>it to grow moldier. </b>Therefore, it is possible that even though only a brief time has passed, the <i>matza</i> has grown very moldy, due to the moisture and heat inside the vessel.", 
            "In regard to the aforementioned principle, the Gemara asks: <b>And do we, </b>in general, <b>follow the last </b>item in determining the identity of the item in question? <b>But wasn’t it taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: </b>With regard to <b>a box </b>that people <b>used for </b>both <b>non-sacred coins</b><b> and </b>second-<b>tithe coins, if the majority </b>of its use was for <b>non-sacred </b>money, the coins are considered <b>non</b><b>-sacred. If the majority </b>of its use was for second-<b>tithe </b>coins, the coins are considered second-<b>tithe </b>money. The Gemara asks: <b>But why </b>is this so? <b>Let us </b><b>follow </b>the <b>last </b>item placed in the box.", 
            "<b>Rav Naḥman bar </b><b>Yitzḥak said: With what are we dealing here? </b>We are dealing with a case <b>where </b>people <b>used </b>the box <b>for </b>both <b>non-sacred coins and </b>second-<b>tithe coins, and he </b><b>does not know which </b>of the two kinds of money was placed there <b>last.</b><br><b>Rav Zevid said: </b>The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he used </b>one part of the box for <b>piles </b>of non-sacred coins and another part of the box for <b>piles </b>of second-tithe coins. In this case, there was no definitive most recent use of the box, as a coin may have moved from one side of the box to the other.<br><b>Rav Pappa </b><b>said: </b>We are dealing with a case <b>where </b>the coin <b>was found in a hole </b>in the box. The concern is that this coin might not be of the type last placed into the box. Instead, it is possible that this coin remained from a previous use and was not removed because it was obscured in the hole.", 
            "<b>Rav Yehuda said: </b><b>One who searches </b>for leaven <b>must recite a blessing</b><b>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What blessing does he recite, </b>i.e., what is the correct formula of the blessing? <b>Rav Pappi </b><b>said in the name of Rava </b>that one <b>recites: </b>Who has made us holy through His mitzvot and has commanded us <b>to remove leavened bread.

        [
            "<b>Where </b><b>they disagree is with regard to </b>the formula: <b>Concerning the </b><b>elimination </b>of leaven. One <b>Sage, </b>Rav Pappi, <b>maintains </b>that <b>it</b><b> is referring to </b>an act that was performed <b>previously. </b>Since this formula is referring to the removal of leaven as a task already completed, it would be more appropriate for a blessing recited after performance of that mitzva was completed. <b>And </b>the other <b>Sage, </b>Rav Pappa, <b>maintains </b>that this expression <b>refers to the future</b><b>.</b>", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Pappi’s opinion from the formula of the blessing recited just prior to circumcision: <b>Blessed </b>are You…<b>W</b><b>ho</b><b> has made us holy through His mitzvot and has commanded</b><b> us concerning circumcision. </b>Apparently this expression indeed is referring to a future act.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this contention: That is no proof, as <b>what </b>alternative formula <b>can </b><b>we recite there? </b>If <b>we say: </b>He, Who has made us holy through His mitzvot and commanded us <b>to circumcise,</b><b> is there no alternative to he </b>himself, i.e., the boy’s father, <b>circumcising </b>his son? The father is commanded to circumcise his son, and he may appoint one who is not commanded to circumcise his son to act in his stead. Therefore, the more general formula of the blessing is recited: About the circumcision. The Gemara raises a difficulty: In a case where <b>the child’s father </b>himself circumcises his son, <b>what can be said? </b>The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, it is indeed so. </b>If the father himself performs the circumcision he in fact recites the blessing: And has commanded us to circumcise.", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>to Rav Pappi’s opinion. The blessing recited over ritual slaughter is: <b>Blesse</b><b>d</b>…<b>W</b><b>ho has made us </b><b>holy through His mitzvot and has commanded us concerning slaughtering.</b> This blessing likewise indicates that this formula is appropriate prior to an action. The Gemara again rejects this claim: <b>There</b><b> too, what </b>alternative formula <b>can we recite? </b>If <b>we say</b><b>: </b>Who has commanded us <b>to slaughter, is there no </b><b>alternative to his slaughtering </b>the animal? There is no mitzva to slaughter an animal. It is merely the necessary preparation before one may eat meat. Therefore, the more general formula of the blessing is recited: Concerning slaughtering.", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, with regard to the slaughter of the <b>Paschal lamb and </b>other <b>consecrated </b>animals, <b>what can be said? </b>One is indeed commanded to slaughter these animals. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is </b><b>indeed so. </b>When slaughtering the Paschal lamb or any other offering, one recites: Who has commanded us to slaughter.", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>to Rav Pappi’s opinion from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who prepares a </b><b><i>lulav</i></b><b> for himself </b><b>recites the blessing: Who has given us life, sustained us, </b><b>and brought us to this time. </b>When <b>he takes it </b><b>to fulfill with it </b>the obligation to take the <i>lulav</i>, <b>he says: Who has made us holy through His mitzvot </b><b>and has commanded us concerning the taking of the </b><b><i>lulav</i></b><b>.</b> Although he has yet to perform the mitzva, he does not recite the formula: To take. The Gemara answers: <b>It</b><b> is different there, as at the time when he lifts</b> the <i>lulav</i> before he recites the blessing, he already <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation by Torah law. Consequently, the formula: Concerning the taking, is indeed more appropriate for an action that he has already performed.", 
            "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so</b><b>, </b>the statement that he takes it <b>to fulfill </b>his obligation <b>with it </b>is imprecise, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have </b>said that he took the <i>lulav</i> <b>with which </b>he already <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed </b><b>so; </b>the <i>tanna</i> should have formulated the <i>halakha</i> in that manner. <b>But due to </b>the fact <b>that he wants to </b><b>teach the latter clause </b>of the <i>baraita</i>: One who comes <b>to sit in the </b><b><i>sukka</i></b><b>, he likewise taught </b>in <b>the</b><b> first clause: To fulfill </b>his obligation <b>with it. </b>This phrase maintains the consistency of the language of the <i>Tosefta</i>, even though it is imprecise with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of <i>lulav</i>.",

The Gemara concludes: <b>And the </b><b><i>halakha</i></b><b> is</b> that one should recite: <b>Concerning the removal of leaven</b><b>, </b>as that expression is referring to the future as well.", 
            "The Gemara poses a question: <b>In any event,</b> it is clear from the previous discussion that <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>one is required to recite a blessing prior to</b> performing a mitzva. <b>From where do we </b>derive this principle?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where may it be inferred that </b>the word <b><i>over</i></b><b> is the language of priority?

            "The mishna states that one searches for leaven <b>by the light of </b><b>the lamp, etc. </b>The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these </b><b>matters, </b>i.e., that the search should be conducted by the light of the lamp, derived? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: We </b><b>derive </b>it by the hermeneutic principles of verbal analogy and juxtaposition: The term <b>finding </b>in one context is derived <b>from </b><b>finding </b>in another context, <b>and finding </b>is derived <b>from </b>the word <b>searching, and </b>this <b>searching </b>is derived <b>from searching </b>elsewhere, <b>and searching </b>there is derived <b>from </b>the word <b>lamps, </b><b>and lamps </b>is derived <b>from lamp.</b>", 
            "The Gemara cites the relevant verses included in the above derivation. <b>Finding </b>in one context is derived <b>from finding </b>in another context by verbal analogy, as <b>it is written here: “Seven days leaven </b><b>shall not be found in your houses” </b>(Exodus 12:19), <b>and</b><b> it is written there: “And he searched, starting with</b><b> the eldest, and ending with the youngest; and </b>the goblet <b>was found </b>in Benjamin’s sack” (Genesis 44:12). <b>And </b>the word <b>finding </b>in this verse is connected <b>to searching in</b><b> that same </b>verse by juxtaposition, as the verse says: “And he searched... and was found.”",

By the same token, if most stores in that city sell non-kosher meat, the meat found is presumed to be non-kosher. These two principles can be applied to the cases involving piles of <i>matza</i> and leaven: If the morsel was separated from the piles when taken by the mouse, follow the majority. However, if the mouse took the morsel from one of the piles, the legal status of the morsel is that of an equally balanced uncertainty concerning whether it was taken from a pile of <i>matza</i> or a pile of leaven, and the owner is required to conduct an additional search.", 
            "The Gemara discusses another case: There are <b>two piles</b><b>,</b><b> one of </b><b><i>matza</i></b><b> and one of leavened bread, and before them </b>there are <b>two houses, one </b>which was <b>searched and one </b>which was <b>not searched, and two mice came, </b>and in our presence <b>one took </b><b><i>matza</i></b><b> and one took leavened bread. </b>Each mouse went into a different house, <b>and we do not </b><b>know which </b>mouse <b>entered this </b>house <b>and which </b>mouse <b>entered </b><b>that </b>house.

However, in the case of new grain, he is processing the grain, preparing it for consumption. Therefore, the concern is that he will come to eat it unwittingly.",

Therefore, there is no concern lest one eat it unwittingly before the <i>omer</i> offering is sacrificed.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>That </b>statement <b>of Rav Ashi is </b><b>a mistake</b><b>,</b> as this suggestion can easily be refuted. <b>That </b>works out <b>well </b>with regard to the status of the grain <b>from </b>the point that the grain was processed into flour or <b>toasted grain and forward, </b>as there is no concern lest one come to eat it.

            "The above conclusion was that Rabbi Yehuda distinguishes between prohibitions involving substances from which people regularly separate themselves and prohibitions involving substances from which people are not used to keeping their distance. The Gemara asks: <b>And anywhere that </b>one <b>does not </b><b>distance </b>himself from a prohibition, <b>does Rabbi Yehuda issue a </b><b>decree </b>that one must keep away from a prohibited item to avoid accidentally using it?",

The concern is lest one forget and take the tube and use the oil for some other purpose, and violate the prohibition against extinguishing a flame on Shabbat.", 
            "<b>And Rabbi Yehuda permits </b>using a tube in that manner, as he is not concerned lest one remove it. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda does not issue a decree even with regard to an item from which people do not distance themselves, e.g., oil. The Gemara answers: <b>There, </b><b>due to the stringency of Shabbat, one distances </b>himself, as on Shabbat one is careful to distance himself from a candle or anything placed alongside it.", 
            "<b>And </b>the Gemara <b>raised a contradiction </b>between this <i>halakha</i> <b>of Shabbat </b>and another <i>halakha</i> of <b>Shabbat, as it was </b><b>taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the rope of </b><b>a bucket that was severed </b>on Shabbat, where one needs the rope to draw water from a well, <b>he may</b><b> not tie it </b>with a regular knot, as by Torah law it is prohibited to tie a permanent knot. <b>Rather, </b>he may <b>tie it </b>into <b>a bow. </b>However, <b>Rabbi </b><b>Yehuda says: One </b>may <b>wrap a money belt [</b><b><i>punda</i></b><b>]</b> <b>around it or a sash [</b><b><i>pesikya</i></b><b>]</b><b>,</b><b> provided that he </b><b>does not tie it </b>into <b>a bow, </b>lest he tie a proper knot.",

There is likewise <b>a difficulty</b> between one statement <b>of the Rabbis, </b>who prohibit placing a tube of oil beside the lamp, and the other ruling <b>of the Rabbis, </b>where they permit tying a bow to reattach the severed rope of a bucket.", 
            "The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of</b><b> the Rabbis </b>and the other statement <b>of the Rabbis </b>is <b>not difficult, </b>as one usage of <b>oil </b>might <b>be </b><b>confused with </b>another usage of <b>oil. </b>Given that it is permitted to use oil for other purposes, one is apt to utilize this oil as well.

            "<b>And </b>the Gemara <b>raised</b><b> a contradiction between </b>one statement of <b>the Rabbis </b>and another statement <b>of the Rabbis, as we learned </b>in a mishna: <b>One may tie a bucket with a sash, </b>to draw water from a well, <b>but </b>one may <b>not </b>do so <b>with a rope, and Rabbi Yehuda permits </b>the use of a rope.

            "<b>Rather</b><b>, </b>it is <b>obvious </b>that the mishna is speaking about a rope used in the work <b>of a weaver [</b><b><i>gardi</i></b><b>]</b><b>.</b> The legal status of this rope differs from that of an ordinary rope, as the weaver will certainly not leave his rope attached to a bucket and thereby negate any other use. Consequently, this knot is a temporary one.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>did <b>the Rabbis issue a decree </b>prohibiting the rope <b>of a</b><b> weaver due to a standard rope </b>but they did not issue a decree prohibiting a bow due to a knot?

Even without that detail, the second pair of witnesses can still testify that the first pair of witnesses was with them in a different place at that time.", 
            "Based on the above, the Gemara returns to discuss the matter of discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses with regard to the hour that the incident occurred. <b>And if you</b><b> say </b>that <b>a person errs </b>by <b>that much, </b>e.g., several hours, with regard to the <b>interrogations of what time</b> of day the incident occurred, this <b>is also testimony </b><b>that you cannot render as false, conspiring </b>testimony, <b>for </b>if other witnesses claim that they were elsewhere at that time, the witnesses can <b>say: We are mistaken, </b>and the incident did not actually occur at that time, but a few hours earlier or later. Consequently, it is impossible to prove that they are false, conspiring witnesses.", 
            "The Gemara explains <b>that we give </b>leeway to the first pair of witnesses for <b>the entire </b>duration of the potential margin of <b>their error. </b>In order to render them false, conspiring witnesses, the second pair of witnesses must testify that the first witnesses were with them for the entire period during which their testimony would be accepted, despite the discrepancy with regard to the hour in which it occurred. <b>According to Rabbi </b><b>Meir, we give </b>the witnesses who testified that the incident occurred at two or three hours of the day, <b>from </b><b>the beginning of the first hour until the end of </b><b>the fifth </b>hour. If they testified that the incident occurred in the second hour or the third hour, the court must take into account a mistake of two hours in either direction.", 
            "<b>And by right we should </b><b>give them even more </b>leeway <b>at the beginning. </b>Since one errs by two hours less a bit, if the witnesses testified that the incident occurred at approximately two hours of the day, they might have erred by roughly two hours and the incident actually occurred before sunrise. <b>However, </b>since <b>between</b><b> day and night people do not err, </b>and as the witnesses testify that the incident occurred during the second or third hour of the day, it could not have occurred before sunrise.", 
            "<b>And</b><b> according to Rabbi Yehuda, we give </b>the witnesses a margin of error <b>from the beginning of the first hour until</b><b> the end of the sixth </b>hour. <b>And by right</b><b> we should give them even more </b>leeway <b>at the beginning</b><b>, </b>as according to his opinion one errs by three hours less a bit, and therefore the margin for error should be greater.

        [
            "<b>However, between day and night people do </b><b>not err, </b>and therefore there is no concern that they might have erred in this regard. <b>And </b>similarly, <b>by right </b><b>we should give them even more </b>leeway <b>at the end </b>of the period. <b>However, </b>this too is not a reasonable discrepancy, <b>as at five </b>hours of the day <b>the sun </b>is <b>in the east and at seven </b>hours <b>the sun </b>is <b>in the west. </b>No one confuses the morning with the afternoon.", 
            "In light of the above conclusions, the Gemara returns to address the issue of leaven. <b>We learned </b>in the mishna that <b>Rabbi </b><b>Meir says: One </b>may <b>eat </b>leaven <b>the entire fifth </b>hour of the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>and one </b>must <b>burn </b>it immediately afterward <b>at the beginning of the sixth </b>hour. <b>Rabbi </b><b>Yehuda says: One </b>may <b>eat the entire fourth </b>hour, <b>and </b>one <b>places it in abeyance </b>for <b>the entire fifth </b>hour, <b>and one burns </b>it <b>at the beginning of the sixth </b>hour.", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>According to Abaye’s </b>explanation <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir, that he said a person </b><b>does not err </b>about the time <b>at all, let him </b><b>eat </b>leaven for <b>the entire sixth </b>hour, as by Torah law it is permitted to eat until the end of the sixth hour, i.e., midday. The Sages issued a decree prohibiting the consumption of leaven from the beginning of the sixth hour, lest one unwittingly come to eat after midday. However, according to Rabbi Meir, people do not err in this regard at all and that concern is unfounded. <b>And according to that version </b>of Rabbi Meir’s opinion, <b>that </b>he <b>said a person errs a bit, let </b>him <b>eat </b>leaven <b>until </b>just before <b>the end of the </b><b>sixth </b>hour.", 
            "<b>And </b>according to <b>Abaye’</b><b>s </b>explanation <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, </b><b>that he said: A person errs </b>by <b>half an hour;</b><b> let </b>him <b>eat </b>leaven <b>until the midpoint of the sixth</b> hour. <b>And even according to the version </b>of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, <b>that </b>he <b>said: A person errs </b>by <b>an hour plus a bit; let him eat </b>leaven <b>until </b>just before <b>the end of the fifth </b>hour. From the fact that this is not the ruling of these Sages, apparently Abaye’s assessment of the amount of time that a person errs is incorrect.", 
            "<b>Rather, Abaye said: </b>There is a difference between the issues of testimony and leaven, as <b>testimony is entrusted to the vigilant</b><b>.</b> One comes to testify only if he thoroughly scrutinized the subject of his testimony. Therefore, he will not err significantly with regard to the time in question. However, the prohibition against eating <b>leavened bread is </b>a <i>halakha</i> <b>entrusted to all, </b>and not everyone is able to correctly determine the time. Consequently, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda both extend the margin for error, so that people will not unwittingly eat leaven after the time that it is prohibited to do so.", 
            "The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>And </b>according to <b>Rava</b><b>’s </b>explanation <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir</b><b>, that he said: A person errs </b>by <b>two hours less</b><b> a bit; from the beginning of the fifth </b>hour <b>let</b><b> one no </b>longer <b>eat </b>leaven.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, during the sixth </b>hour <b>let</b><b> him eat </b>leaven <b>as well, </b>as one distinguishes between the sixth hour and the seventh hour since the sun tends westward only during the seventh hour. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b><b> said: </b>In the <b>sixth </b>hour, <b>the day, </b>i.e., the sun, <b>stands at the meridian, </b>equidistant between east and west, and it is unclear toward which direction it tends. Therefore, confusion between the sixth and seventh hours is possible.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>according to <b>Rava’s </b>explanation <b>in </b><b>accordance with </b>the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, that he said: </b><b>A person errs </b>by <b>three hours less a bit; from </b><b>the beginning of the fourth </b>hour <b>let one no </b>longer <b>eat </b>leaven.

            "<b>And Rava said: That is not the reason </b>for the added hour in the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, </b>as he is not concerned lest people err. <b>Rather, Rabbi Yehuda </b>conforms <b>to his </b>standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said: The</b><b> removal of leaven </b>can be performed <b>only </b>by <b>burning</b> it, <b>and </b>therefore by prohibiting the consumption of leaven, <b>the Sages provided him </b>with <b>one hour during which to</b><b> gather wood </b>to burn the leaven.", 
            "<b>Ravina raised an objection to </b>the opinion of <b>Rava </b>from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When </b>is it that the elimination of leaven can be performed only by burning it? It is only when one removes the leaven <b>not at the time </b>designated <b>for its removal. </b>Then, one should seek out the preferred method of removal and implement it in the ideal manner. <b>However, </b>when one removes the leaven <b>at the time </b>designated <b>for its removal, </b>at the end of the sixth hour when he must remove the leaven immediately, <b>the removal of </b>leaven may be performed <b>in any manner, </b>and one need not seek wood for burning. Why, then, was it necessary for the Sages to provide him with an hour to gather wood?", 
            "<b>Rather, Rava </b>reconsidered the previous explanation and <b>said:</b><b> It is a </b>rabbinic <b>decree due to a cloudy day</b><b>,</b> when one is unable to observe the precise position of the sun, increasing the likelihood of confusion. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, </b>then <b>even at fourth </b>hour <b>let one no </b>longer <b>eat </b>leaven, as according to Rabbi Yehuda a person errs by three hours less a bit. <b>Rav Pappa said: </b>The <b>fourth </b>hour <b>is mealtime for </b><b>everyone</b><b>,</b> and therefore everyone is aware of that hour and will not confuse it with another.", 
            "In light of Rav Pappa’s statement, the Gemara discusses the topic of mealtimes. <b>The </b><b>Sages taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: Eating in <b>the first hour </b>of the morning is the time of <b>eating for </b><b><i>Ludim</i></b><b>,</b> who are members of a nation of cannibals, and they are ravenous and in a hurry to eat. <b>The </b><b>second </b>hour is the time of <b>eating for robbers [</b><b><i>listin</i></b><b>]</b><b>.</b> Since they spend the night stealing, they eat early in the morning. <b>The third </b>hour is the time of <b>eating for heirs, </b>i.e., people who inherited a lot of money and do not work for their sustenance.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <b>didn’t Rav Pappa say </b>that the <b>fourth </b>hour <b>is </b>the <b>time of eating for all? </b><b>Rather, reverse </b>the fourth, fifth, and sixth hours: The <b>fourth </b>hour is <b>mealtim</b><b>e</b><b> for all people, </b>the <b>fifth </b>hour is the time of <b>eating for workers, </b>and <b>the sixth </b>hour is the time of <b>eating for Torah scholars</b><b>.</b>", 
            "One who eats <b>from </b>this point <b>forward </b>does not benefit from eating, as he is <b>like one who throws a stone into a</b> leather <b>bottle</b><b>,</b> i.e., it does not contribute to his health. <b>Abaye said: We only said that </b>eating from the sixth hour onward is not beneficial, <b>when he </b><b>did not taste anything in the morning; however, if he </b><b>tasted something in the morning we have no </b>problem <b>with </b><b>it.</b>",

This unattributed mishna must be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, as Rabbi Yehuda maintains that during the fifth hour it is prohibited to eat leaven but one may feed it to an animal.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>That </b>mishna <b>is not </b>classified as <b>unattributed,</b> as it is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Gamliel, <b>due to </b>the fact <b>that </b>had the mishna been in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, the term: <b>Permitted, </b>is <b>difficult. </b>Instead, the mishna should have been formulated: When one eats he may feed.",

Since Rabban Gamliel distinguishes between the time one must desist from eating <i>teruma</i> and the latest time that one may eat non-sacred food, his is evidently an unrelated opinion that is in no way a compromise between the other two rulings.", 
            "<b>And if you wish, say </b>instead: When <b>Rav said </b>that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, he ruled <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>this </b><b><i>tanna</i></b><b>, as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the fourteenth </b>of Nisan <b>that occurs</b><b> on Shabbat, </b>one does not remove leaven on Passover eve in the usual manner.

            "Apropos the previous statement that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>what, is it not </b>that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his opinion <b>even </b>with regard <b>to eating? </b>Rav’s ruling indicates that one may eat leaven until the end of the fourth hour, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Rav Pappa said </b><b>in the name of Rava: No, </b>the aforementioned ruling applies only to the obligation <b>to remove </b>leaven, i.e., the Sages agreed that it is permitted to remove pure <i>teruma</i> on Friday only if there is no one available to eat it.", 
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And even Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with this </b>statement <b>of Rav Naḥman, </b>and rules that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>As Ravin bar Rav Adda said: </b>There was <b>an incident </b>that occurred involving <b>a certain person who</b><b> deposited a saddlebag [</b><b><i>disakkayya</i></b><b>]</b><b> filled with leavened brea</b><b>d</b> <b>with Yoḥanan Ḥakuka’a, and mice bore </b>a hole <b>in </b>the bag, <b>and leavened bread was spilling out </b>of the sack. <b>And he came before Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi on Passover eve to ask what he should do.

            "The Gemara responds: Eating it himself is not an option <b>due to </b>the potential of <b>suspicion.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: It is <b>obvious </b>that one may not bring this offering on Passover, as it contains leaven. <b>Rav Adda </b><b>bar Ahava said: Here </b>this <i>baraita</i> is not referring to the prohibition against bringing the offering on Passover itself.

The reason is that a thanks-offering may be eaten for one full day and the following night, and if it is brought on the eve of Passover, the time available before disqualification is reduced.", 
            "<b>And </b>therefore, <b>everyone </b>who ascended on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem and were obligated to bring thanks-offerings <b>brought </b><b>them on the thirteenth </b>of Nisan. <b>And since </b>these thanks-offerings <b>are numerous, they are disqualified by </b>virtue of their being <b>left overnight, </b>as priests are unable to eat their portions from the loaves of all the offerings brought that day.", 
            "<b>They said in the name of </b><b>Rabbi Yannai: </b>The loaves placed as an indicator <b>were not </b><b>disqualifie</b><b>d</b> by being left overnight. <b>Rather, why did </b>the <i>tanna</i> <b>call them disqualified? </b>It was due to the fact <b>that</b><b> no </b>animal <b>offering was slaughtered together </b>with <b>them </b>to consecrate them, but they were consecrated as thanks-offering loaves independently. They could not be eaten until the offering with which they were brought was slaughtered. The Gemara asks: <b>And </b><b>let us slaughter </b>the thanks-offering to render the loaves permitted. The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where the </b>animal for the <b>offering was lost.</b>", 
            "The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>And let us bring another</b> animal to replace the first one for <b>sacrifice and let</b><b> them slaughter </b>it. The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where </b>the one who consecrated the thanks-offering <b>said: This</b><b> is a thanks-offering and these are its loaves</b><b>.</b> He consecrated the animal and the loaves together, <b>and </b>this is <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabba, as Rabba</b><b> said: </b>If <b>the loaf </b>of a thanks-offering is <b>lost</b><b>, </b>its owner <b>brings another loaf </b>to complete the offering.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And let us redeem </b>the loaves from their consecrated status <b>and render them non-sacred, </b>and there will be no need to burn the loaves. <b>Rather, </b>the Gemara explains that <b>actually, </b>the case is one <b>where the </b>animal <b>offering was</b> indeed <b>slaughtered over </b>the loaves to permit <b>them, but </b>the animal’s <b>blood spilled </b>before it could be sprinkled on the altar. Once the animal has been slaughtered, the loaves are fully consecrated and cannot be redeemed, but in this case, neither can they be eaten, as the blood was not sprinkled on the altar.", 
            "<b>And in accordance with</b><b> whose </b>opinion is this statement that the slaughter of the animal consecrates the loaves and from that point they can no longer be redeemed?

            "However, if <b>one slaughtered them not for their</b> own <b>sake, and </b>the priest <b>sprinkled their blood not for</b><b> their </b>own <b>sake, the loaves are not consecrated, </b>as the factors indispensable in rendering the offering permitted were not properly performed.

            "<b>Rav Yehuda said: </b>The above interpretation is incorrect, as <b>here we are dealing with </b>the <b>secondary</b><b> source of a secondary source of ritual impurity, </b>i.e. meat that came in contact with second-degree ritual impurity.

            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Isn’t </b>there a principle that <b>food does not transmit ritual impurity to</b> other <b>food, as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might </b>have thought that <b>food transmits impurity to </b>other <b>food</b><b>; </b>therefore, <b>the verse states: “And if water is placed upon</b><b> the seed, and any </b>part <b>of a carcass falls upon</b><b> it, it is impure” </b>(Leviticus 11:38).

The result will be significant financial loss, as the legal status of all the wine in the lower press will be that of impure <i>teruma</i>, which is prohibited even for priests to drink.", 
            "In that case, <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua </b><b>concede that if one is able to rescue </b>even <b>a </b><b>quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>from </b>the barrel that broke by receiving the <i>teruma</i> wine in a vessel before it becomes impure, and thereby keep the wine <b>in </b>a state of <b>ritual purity,</b><b> he </b>should <b>rescue </b>it. <b>And </b>if <b>one cannot </b>receive the wine in a pure vessel, as only impure vessels are available, such that if he uses them to receive the wine or to seal the upper press he will render the <i>teruma</i> impure, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: </b>The <i>teruma</i> wine should be allowed to <b>descend and become impure </b>on its own, <b>but one </b>should <b>not </b>actively <b>render it impure with </b>his <b>hand.

            "The Gemara cites several sources to decide the dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> and between Rav and Shmuel with regard to whether or not the impurity of liquids is by Torah law. <b>Come </b>and <b>hear: “And all drink </b><b>that may be drunk in any vessel shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 11:34). This verse clearly indicates that liquids can become impure. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>What is </b>the meaning of the term: <b>Shall be impure, </b>in this context? It means that the liquid <b>renders </b>produce <b>susceptible </b>to ritual impurity.", 
            "The Gemara retorts: Does it in fact mean that the liquid <b>renders </b>produce <b>susceptible </b>to ritual impurity?

            "The Gemara cites another proof. <b>Come </b>and <b>hear</b><b>: “However, a spring or a cistern, a gathering of water</b><b> shall be pure, </b>but he who touches their carcass shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:36). It can be inferred from this verse that all water can be rendered impure, with the exception of spring water and water in a cistern, which are in the ground.

Apparently, water detached from its source does not render food susceptible to impurity by Torah law. The fact that the Sages suspend the capacity of certain liquids to render produce susceptible to impurity indicates that the fact that water removed from its source renders food susceptible to impurity must be by rabbinic decree.

            "The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>Explain this </b>statement as referring <b>to </b><b>blood. </b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina was not referring to all liquids in the Temple, but only to blood. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said </b>that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </b><b>From where </b>is it derived <b>with regard to blood of </b><b>consecrated </b>offerings <b>that it does not render </b>produce <b>susceptible </b>to impurity? <b>As it is stated: </b>“You shall surely not eat the blood; <b>you shall pour it upon the </b><b>earth like water” </b>(Deuteronomy 12:16). The Sages derived from this verse: <b>Blood that is poured like water, </b>i.e., blood from a non-sacred domesticated animal that pours out when it is slaughtered and is not received in a vessel as sacrificial blood assumes the legal status of water and <b>renders </b>produce <b>susceptible </b>to ritual impurity.

Therefore, the liquids listed by Haggai can become impure and transmit impurity by rabbinic law.", 
            "Apropos Rav’s statement with regard to Haggai’s exchange with the priests, the Gemara discusses <b>the </b>matter <b>itself. </b><b>Rav said: The priests erred, </b>as they should have said the oil is rendered impure. <b>And Shmuel said: The priests </b><b>did not err.</b>", 
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav said </b>that <b>the priests erred, </b>as Haggai <b>raised the dilemma before them </b>whether or not <b>consecrated </b>items become impure with <b>fourth-</b>degree ritual impurity. The question in the verse pertains to the following case: One is carrying a dead creeping animal in the corner of his garment and bread comes into contact with it, conferring upon the bread first-degree ritual impurity status; and stew comes in contact with the bread, conferring upon the stew second-degree ritual impurity status; and wine comes in contact with the stew, conferring upon the wine third-degree ritual impurity status; and oil comes into contact with the wine. The question is: In that case, does the wine confer upon the oil fourth-degree ritual impurity? <b>And </b>when <b>the </b><b>priests said to him </b>that it is <b>pure, </b>they erred. In fact, the oil is disqualified with fourth-degree ritual impurity, because it is a consecrated item.", 
            "<b>And Shmuel said: The priests did not err, </b>as Haggai <b>raised the dilemma before them </b>whether or not <b>consecrated </b>items become impure with <b>fifth-</b>degree ritual impurity. According to Shmuel’s explanation, the case is as follows: The corner of the garment comes into contact with a dead creeping animal, conferring upon the garment first-degree ritual impurity status; bread comes into contact with the garment, conferring upon the bread second-degree ritual impurity status; stew comes in contact with the bread, conferring upon the stew third-degree ritual impurity status; and wine comes in contact with the stew, conferring upon the wine fourth-degree ritual impurity status; and oil comes into contact with the wine. In that case, does the wine confer upon the oil fifth-degree ritual impurity? <b>And </b>the priests correctly <b>said to him </b>that the oil is <b>pure.</b>", 
            "The Gemara analyzes this dispute: <b>Granted, </b>according <b>to </b>the opinion of <b>Rav, that is </b>the reason that it is <b>four </b>items <b>that are written </b>in the dilemma raised in the verse: <b>Bread, stew, wine, and oil</b><b>, </b>as the dilemma pertains to fourth-degree ritual impurity. <b>However</b><b>, </b>according <b>to </b><b>Shmuel</b><b>, from where does he </b>learn that the dilemma involves <b>five </b>items?", 
            "The Gemara explains Shmuel’s opinion. <b>Is it written </b>in the verse: <b>And its corner touched </b>the bread, indicating that the primary source of impurity that was in the corner of the garment touched the bread? <b>It is </b>actually <b>written </b>in the verse: <b>“And it touched the corner of his garment,” </b>meaning the bread came into contact <b>with that </b>which <b>touched </b>the primary source of ritual impurity that was in <b>the </b><b>corner of his garment. </b>The bread came into contact with the corner of the garment, not with the primary source of impurity itself. Accordingly, the garment assumes first-degree ritual impurity status, which confers upon the bread second-degree ritual impurity status, which confers upon the stew third-degree ritual impurity status, which confers upon the wine fourth-degree ritual impurity status. Since the wine cannot confer fifth-degree ritual impurity status upon the oil, the oil remains pure.", 
            "The Gemara cites proof from the subsequent verse. <b>Come </b>and <b>hear: “And Haggai said: If one who </b><b>is impure with </b>impurity imparted by <b>a corpse touches any </b><b>of these, shall he be impure? And the priests answered </b><b>and said: He shall be impure” </b>(Haggai 2:13). <b>Granted, </b>according <b>to Shmuel, from </b>the fact that <b>here, </b>with regard to a dead creeping animal, the priests <b>did not err, </b>as Shmuel maintains that the dilemma was with regard to fifth-degree ritual impurity, <b>there too they did not err. However</b><b>, </b>according <b>to Rav, what is different here, </b>concerning the impurity of a creeping animal, such <b>that </b>the priests <b>erred, and</b><b> what is different there, </b>with regard to impurity imparted by a corpse, such <b>that they did not err?</b>", 
            "<b>Rav Naḥman</b><b> said </b>that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: </b>The priests of Haggai’s era <b>were experts with regard to </b>the severe <b>ritual</b><b> impurity </b>imparted by <b>a corpse, </b>as they knew that the impurity of a dead body confers upon a consecrated item fourth-degree ritual impurity status.

            "<b>Ravina said </b>that the distinction between the cases is different. <b>There, </b>the first dilemma addressed <b>fourth-</b>degree ritual impurity, whereas <b>here, </b>the dilemma addressed <b>third-</b>degree ritual impurity. Haggai’s second dilemma does not begin with contact with an item that came into contact with a corpse; rather, it begins with contact with the corpse itself. Since a corpse is the ultimate primary source of impurity, the fourth item is impure with third-degree ritual impurity. The priests knew that <i>halakha</i>.", 
            "<b>Come </b>and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this matter from the next verse: <b>“</b><b>And Haggai answered and said: So is this people, and </b><b>so is this nation before me, said God; </b>and so is all the work of their hands; and that which they offer there is impure” (Haggai 2:14). <b>Granted, </b>according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav </b>that the priests erred, <b>that is</b> the reason <b>that it is written: </b>“That which they offer there is <b>impure,” </b>as the priests’ lack of familiarity with the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity increase the likelihood that all of their Temple service is ritually impure. <b>However, </b>according <b>to </b><b>Shmuel, why </b>does the verse say that their offerings are <b>ritually impure?</b>", 
            "The Gemara answers: According to Shmuel, this is not a statement. Rather, the verse <b>is </b>a rhetorical question expressing <b>bewilderment: </b>Is all the Temple service of the priests really impure? Apparently, they are familiar with the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t</b><b> it written </b>in that verse: <b>“And so is all </b><b>the work of their hands,” </b>which is a statement, not a question? <b>Mar Zutra, and some say </b>it was <b>Rav </b><b>Ashi, said: Since they corrupted their deeds </b>by sinning in general, <b>the verse ascribes to them </b>wrongdoing <b>as if they </b><b>sacrificed offerings in </b>a state of <b>impurity</b><b>.</b>",

If the <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i> inference is rendered moot as a result of applying that principle, the principle is not applied. Because the fact that consecrated objects can assume third-degree impurity status is derived from the verse, if that which emerges from the inference is that <i>halakha</i> itself, the <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i> inference is moot.

            "<b>Rather, Rava said: Leave</b><b> the impurity of </b>the <b>knife, as even </b>outside the Temple <b>in non-sacred </b>circumstances <b>it does not become impure. </b>As in the case of <b>this knife, what did it touch</b> that could transmit impurity? <b>If you say that it </b><b>touched the meat, food does not transmit impurity to a </b><b>vessel. </b>If you say, <b>rather, that it touched the needle</b><b>, a vessel does not transmit impurity to </b>another <b>vessel.</b>", 
            "With regard to <b>this needle</b><b>, </b>the Gemara asks: <b>What is its </b>impurity <b>status?

            "The Gemara analyzes <b>the </b>dispute with regard to the decree that was not issued in Jerusalem <b>itself. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi</b><b> Ḥanina, </b>disagreed. <b>One said: </b>The Sages <b>did not issue </b><b>a decree </b>in the case of <b>uncertainty </b>with regard to the impurity of <b>spittle that is </b>found <b>in Jerusalem</b><b>.</b> <b>And one said: </b>The Sages <b>did not issue a decree </b>in the case of <b>uncertainty </b>with regard to the impurity of <b>vessels in Jerusalem. </b>The Gemara asks: <b>We </b>already <b>learned </b>the <i>halakha</i> of <b>spittle, </b>and similarly, <b>we </b>already <b>learned </b>the <i>halakha</i> of <b>vessels. </b>What do these <i>amora’im</i> add to the earlier tannaitic rulings?", 
            "The Gemara elaborates: <b>We </b>already <b>learned </b>the <i>halakha</i> of <b>spittle, </b><b>as we learned </b>in a mishna: <b>Any spittle found in </b><b>Jerusalem is pure, except for </b>the spittle <b>that is </b>found in the <b>upper market, </b>an area frequented by gentiles (Rambam). The Gemara explains: <b>No, </b>it is <b>necessary </b>for the <i>amora</i> to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even </b>in a case <b>where </b>there is <b>a presumption </b>that there had been <b>a</b> <b><i>zav</i></b> in the area where the spittle was found. Even in that case, no decree of impurity was issued with regard to spittle in Jerusalem.", 
            "Likewise, <b>we </b>already <b>learned </b>the <i>halakha</i> of <b>vessels, as we learned </b>in a mishna: With regard to <b>all the vessels found in Jerusalem</b><b>,</b> if they were found <b>on the path </b>leading <b>down to the ritual</b><b> bath </b>they <b>are </b>presumed <b>ritually impure. </b>These vessels were probably not yet immersed, as people typically bring impure vessels to the ritual bath. By inference, <b>all other </b>vessels found elsewhere <b>are </b>presumed <b>pure.</b>", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And according to your reasoning, say the latter</b><b> clause </b>of the mishna as follows: If the vessels were discovered <b>on the path u</b><b>p</b> from the ritual bath, <b>they are </b>presumed <b>ritually pure. </b>One can learn by inference from this statement the diametric opposite: <b>All other </b>vessels <b>are </b>presumed <b>ritually impure.</b>", 
            "<b>Rather, the first clause </b>of the mishna <b>is precis</b><b>e</b> in its formulation, and therefore inferences may be drawn with regard to other vessels. <b>And the</b><b> latter clause is not precise </b>in this way, <b>and </b>it comes <b>to exclude </b>only <b>the </b>small <b>passageway</b><b>s</b> near the ritual bath, where it is unclear whether the vessels there were being taken to the bath for immersion or from the bath after being immersed. Since the vessels were certainly impure when brought to the ritual bath, and it is uncertain whether or not they were immersed, they retain the presumptive status of impurity. However, in cases where the uncertainty is whether or not the vessels were impure at all, then where the impurity is by rabbinic decree, that decree is not in effect in Jerusalem, and the vessels are ritually pure.", 
            "<b>And </b>the Gemara suggests that according <b>to Rav, who said </b>this is referring to a case <b>where one lost a needle </b>that became impure through contact with a person or vessel impure with <b>ritual impurity </b>imparted <b>by a corpse, and he recognized </b>the needle <b>in the meat </b>of the offering, <b>the conclusion </b><b>should be different.

            "<b>Rav Ashi said: That is to say </b>that the Temple <b>courtyard is a public domai</b><b>n</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of uncertain impurity. <b>And </b>therefore, the ruling in this case <b>is </b>that of <b>uncertainty </b>with regard to <b>impurity in a public domain, </b>as there is no proof that either the vessels or one’s hands came into contact with the ritually impure needle. <b>And </b>the guiding principle in <b>any </b>case of <b>uncertainty </b>with regard to <b>impurity in</b><b> a public domain </b>is that <b>its uncertainty </b>is ruled to be <b>ritually pure. </b>Therefore, the meat, which definitely came into contact with the needle, is impure, while everything else is ritually pure.", 
            "The Gemara asks: One can learn by inference that if this uncertainty developed <b>in the private domain</b><b>, its uncertainty </b>is ruled to be <b>ritually impure. </b>Why would that be the case? <b>Since this needle </b>is <b>an item</b><b> that does not have knowledge to be asked</b><b>,</b> as an inanimate object cannot be consulted with regard to how it became impure or whether it became impure at all, the following principle is in effect: With regard to <b>any</b><b> item </b>or person <b>that does not have knowledge to be</b><b> asked, </b>the person referring to one who lacks the competence to answer the question, <b>whether </b>the uncertainty developed <b>in the</b><b> public domain or whether </b>it was <b>in the private domain</b><b>, its uncertainty </b>is ruled to be <b>ritually pure.</b>", 
            "The Gemara responds: Although a needle does not have knowledge to be asked, it is nevertheless impure <b>due </b><b>to </b>the fact <b>that </b>its uncertainty <b>is uncertainty </b>with regard to <b>impurity that comes </b>about <b>by means of a person. </b>The knife did not come into contact with the needle on its own; rather, a person was holding the knife. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan stated </b>another principle: In a case of <b>uncertainty </b>with regard to <b>impurity that comes </b>about <b>by means </b><b>of a person</b><b>,</b> "

            "It was taught that if an impure needle were found in an animal, <b>the meat is ritually impure. </b>The Gemara asks: <b>With what </b>liquid <b>was this meat rendered susceptible</b> to impurity?

            "<b>Rather, </b>say that the meat <b>is rendered susceptible </b>to ritual impurity <b>by the esteem for </b><b>sacred </b>objects.

The Gemara rejects that possibility: <b>Say that the esteem for sacred </b>objects <b>is effective to disqualify </b>the meat <b>itself </b>despite the fact that it was not rendered susceptible to receive impurity, but <b>does it also </b>transmit impurity to the extent that one <b>counts first- and second-</b>degree impurity from contact with that meat?

            "If so, <b>resolve </b>from here <b>that which Reish Lakish raised as a dilemma: </b>With regard to <b>a mass from meal-offerings</b><b>,</b> does one <b>count first- and second-</b>degree impurity from contact with it <b>or not? </b>Due to the esteem for sacred objects, the offering itself can become impure without having been rendered susceptible through contact with liquid; however, the dilemma is whether or not it transmits impurity to other objects.", 
            "The Gemara responds: Perhaps the dilemma with regard to the status of ritual impurity due to esteem for sacred objects has not in fact been resolved.

            "And it indeed follows logically that just as Rabbi Shimon exempts one who eats the sciatic nerve in that particular case, <b>so too here, Rabbi </b><b>Shimon prohibits </b>deriving <b>benefit </b>from the sciatic nerve. <b>As it </b><b>was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is permitted to </b>derive <b>benefit from the sciatic nerve</b><b>;</b> this is <b>the statement</b><b> of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Shimon prohibits </b>it. Since Rabbi Shimon holds that the sciatic nerve does not give flavor, it cannot be included in the exception of the animal carcass. Therefore, from the verse that prohibits eating the sciatic nerve he learns that one may not benefit from it either, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Abbahu. Rabbi Abbahu’s position fits according to both opinions. However, the mishna that indicates that it is permitted to derive benefit from the sciatic nerve is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, as he holds that the sciatic nerve gives flavor and is therefore included in the exception of the animal carcass.",

A third prohibition applies to creeping animals that live in the water, as the verses say: “And all that have neither fins nor scales…They shall be a detestable thing unto you; you shall not eat of their flesh” (Leviticus 11:10–11). A fourth prohibition is cited in the verse: “And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is impure unto you” (Deuteronomy 14:10). ",

With regard to <i>tereifa</i> it is written: “And you shall be holy men unto Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field [<i>tereifa</i>]; you shall cast it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30).

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that </b>in <b>any </b>case <b>where its mitzva has </b>already <b>been performed, </b>the object <b>is not subject to </b>the prohibition of <b>misuse of</b><b> consecrated property? And the </b>daily <b>removal of ashe</b><b>s</b> of the offerings from the altar occurs after <b>its mitzva has </b><b>been performed, and </b>the ashes are <b>subject to </b>the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property, as it is written: </b>“And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed of the burnt-offering on the altar, <b>and he</b><b> shall put them beside the altar” </b>(Leviticus 6:3). The Sages derive from the phrase: “And he shall put them” <b>that he </b>may <b>not scatter </b>these ashes; rather, they should be placed gently. <b>“And he shall put them” </b>also indicates <b>that one </b>may <b>not </b>derive <b>benefit </b>from these ashes.", 
            "The Gemara answers: This case does not prove a principle, <b>because the </b><i>halakhot</i> of <b>removal of ashes</b> from the altar <b>and </b>of <b>the priestly garments </b>worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur <b>are two verses that</b><b> come as one. </b>The principle is that <b>two verses </b><b>that come as one do not teach </b>a principle. In other words, if a <i>halakha</i> is stated twice, with regard to two individual cases in the Torah, the understanding is that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those cases. Had this <i>halakha</i> applied to all other relevant cases as well, it would not have been necessary for the Torah to teach it twice. The fact that two cases are mentioned indicates that they are the exceptions rather than the rule.", 
            "The Gemara delineates the two cases: The <i>halakha</i> of the <b>removal of ashes </b><b>is that which we said. </b>Where is this <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to <b>the priestly garments? As it is written: </b>“And Aharon shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the sacred place, <b>and he </b><b>shall leave them there” </b>(Leviticus 16:23). The phrase: “And he shall leave them” <b>teaches that they require burial. </b>Although their use for the mitzva has been completed, it is prohibited to derive benefit from them.", 
            "The Gemara comments: <b>It works out well</b> that there are two cases <b>according to </b>the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say </b>that this verse <b>teaches that </b><b>they require burial. However, according to </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b><b>Dosa, who disagrees with them </b>and <b>says: </b>These priestly clothes may no longer be used by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, <b>but they are fit </b>for use <b>by a </b><b>common priest, </b>since these garments are similar to those worn by common priests every day. <b>And what </b>is the meaning of: <b>“And he shall leave them there”? </b>This indicates <b>that</b> the High Priest <b>may not use them on another Yom</b><b> Kippur. </b>According to this opinion, <b>what can be said? </b>According to the opinion of Rabbi Dosa, there is only one verse that teaches about misuse of consecrated property with an item that has already been used for performing its mitzva. Therefore, it should be possible to derive a principle from the verse dealing with the removal of ashes. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: A principle cannot be based on this verse, <b>because removal of ashes and the heifer</b><b> whose neck is broken</b><b>,</b> from which one may not derive benefit after the ceremony, <b>are two verses that come</b><b> as one. And two verses that come as one do</b><b> not teach </b>a principle.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>It works out well according</b><b> to the one who said </b>that <b>they do not teach</b> a principle, i.e., according to the Rabbis. <b>However, according</b><b> to the one who said </b>that <b>they do teach </b>a principle, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i>, <b>what can</b><b> be said? </b>The Gemara answers: <b>Two </b>phrases indicating <b>exclusions </b><b>are written </b>with regard to these <i>halakhot</i>, limiting this rule to them. With regard to the removal of ashes <b>it </b><b>is written: “And he shall put it.” </b>The word “it” limits the <i>halakha</i> to this particular circumstance. With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken <b>it is written: “The</b> heifer <b>which had its neck broken” </b>(Deuteronomy 21:6). The word “the” indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to this type of heifer and not to any other similar case.", 
            "After this tangential discussion of the laws of misuse of consecrated property, the Gemara returns to Abaye and Rava’s dispute about the status of unintended benefit, seeking to prove one side or the other. <b>Come </b>and <b>hear </b>a proof based on what was taught: If <b>one brought </b>the heifer whose neck is to be broken or the red heifer <b>into</b><b> a cow pen</b><b>,</b><b> and it threshes </b>grain while walking with other cows, then <b>it is valid. </b>Under normal circumstances, had one used the heifer for work, it would be disqualified from use in its ceremony. However, in this case, the red heifer may still be burned, and the heifer is still fit to have its neck broken in the ritual. Apparently, the verses “Upon which a yoke has not been placed” (Numbers 19:2) and “Which has not been used for work” (Deuteronomy 21:3) still apply to it, because the owner did not intend for it to work. If he brought it in <b>so that it may nurse </b>from its mother <b>and so it will thresh </b>grain, then <b>it is</b><b> disqualified </b>from use in these rituals.", 
            "<b>And here, isn’t it </b>a case <b>where it</b><b> was not possible </b>to act differently, as the heifer needs to nurse, <b>and he intended </b>that it thresh the grain? <b>And it is teaching that </b>the heifer <b>is disqualified </b>from use. This proves that when one intends to derive benefit, even if there is no other way to act, it is prohibited to derive benefit. The Gemara rejects this: <b>It</b><b> is different there, as it is written: “Which has not</b><b> been used for work” in any case. </b>Therefore, while the heifer is disqualified from use even if the situation was unavoidable, no general conclusion can be drawn from this case.", 
            "The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b><b> so, </b>that this verse means that it has not performed any work at all, then it should apply <b>even to</b><b> the first clause. </b>Even when it threshes the grain against the will of the owner, it has still done work and should be rendered disqualified. "
        ], 
        [
            "The Gemara answers. <b>This </b>case <b>is comparable only to that </b>other case: If <b>a bird landed on </b>the red heifer <b>it </b>remains <b>valid, </b>since this is not considered to be like bearing a yoke. If <b>a male </b>animal <b>mounted i</b><b>t</b> to mate with it, <b>it is unfit </b>and may not be used for the ritual. The same applies in this case: When the owner moves the heifer into a pen and it threshes, since the owner is uninterested in this action, it is like the case of the bird and the heifer remains valid. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason </b>for the difference between the case where a bird lands on it and where a male animal attempts to mate with it?", 
            "<b>Rav Pappa said </b>that the verse says: “And the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not been used for work, and which has not drawn in the yoke” (Deuteronomy 21:3). <b>If</b><b> it were written: “He worked [</b><b><i>avad</i></b><b>],” and we read: “He</b><b> worked [</b><b><i>avad</i></b><b>],” </b>this word choice would indicate that the heifer could still be used <b>until he, </b>the owner of the heifer himself, <b>used it </b>willingly for labor. <b>If it </b><b>were written: “It was worked [</b><b><i>ubbad</i></b><b>],” and we read: “It </b><b>was worked [</b><b><i>ubbad</i></b><b>],” </b>it would indicate that <b>even </b>if it performed labor <b>on its own it is also </b>prohibited to use it, since some form of labor had been done with it.", 
            "<b>Now that it is written: “</b><b>He worked [</b><b><i>avad</i></b><b>],” but we read </b>this word as: <b>“</b><b>It was worked [</b><b><i>ubbad</i></b><b>],</b><b>”</b> both meanings are intended: It is prohibited if <b>it is worked in a similar </b>manner to the way <b>he works. </b>In other words, <b>just as </b>the owner <b>works </b>the animal in a way <b>that is </b><b>beneficial to him, so too, </b>the animal becomes prohibited only when <b>it is worked </b>in a way <b>that causes him </b><b>to </b>derive <b>benefit </b>from this labor. Therefore, it still may be used if a bird lands on it, because the owner does not derive benefit from this in any way. However, if a male bull mates with this heifer it is rendered unfit, since the owner generally has an interest in this occurring. ", 
            "The Gemara cites an additional proof. <b>Come </b>and <b>hear </b>from that which is taught: If one finds <b>a lost item, he </b>may <b>not spread it out over a bed or over </b><b>a fram</b><b>e</b><b> for his </b>own <b>purposes, </b>since this is deriving benefit from an object that does not belong to him. <b>However, he </b>may <b>spread it out over a bed or</b><b> a frame for its </b>own <b>sake </b>if it requires airing. <b>If guests happen </b>to come <b>to him, he may not</b><b> spread it out, neither for its sake nor for his</b> own <b>purpose. </b>Apparently, the benefit is unavoidable and intended, as there is no other way for him to care for the lost object, and he benefits from having his guests see the item; nonetheless, it is still prohibited. This seems to prove that Rava’s opinion is correct. ", 
            "The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>It is</b><b> different there, as </b>he risks <b>damaging it, either due to</b><b> the evil eye </b>that he casts upon it <b>or due</b><b> to the thieves </b>who will now know that this valuable item is in his possession and will attempt to steal it. It is not prohibited because of the benefit; rather, it is prohibited due to the concern that he may damage the item. ", 
            "The Gemara offers a final proof. <b>Come </b>and <b>hear </b>a proof based on the following mishna: <b>Clothing merchants </b>who sell garments made of diverse kinds, a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, may <b>sell</b><b> them as they normally would </b>to gentiles. A merchant may place the garments he is selling on his shoulders and need not be concerned about the prohibition against wearing diverse kinds, <b>provided he does not intend </b>to benefit from the garments <b>in the sun </b>as protection <b>from the sun, or</b><b> in the rain </b>as protection <b>from the rain. However, the</b><b> modest </b>people, those who are meticulous in their performance of mitzvot, <b>suspend </b>the wool and linen garments <b>on a</b><b> stick behind them. </b>", 
            "<b>And here, isn’t </b><b>it </b>a case where <b>it is possible </b>for all clothing merchants <b>to act like the modest </b>people and not derive benefit from the mixture of wool and linen? Nonetheless, the mishna states that <b>when one does not intend </b>to benefit from the prohibited item, <b>it is permitted </b>to do so. This presents <b>a conclusive refutation to he who taught the </b><b>first version </b>of <b>Rava’s </b>statement. According to this version, one is prohibited from deriving benefit when it is possible to avoid doing so and he does not intend to derive benefit. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <b>a conclusive </b><b>refutation.</b>", 
            "It was taught in the mishna that <b>one may not</b> even <b>light </b>the oven <b>with </b>leavened bread. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an oven that </b><b>one li</b><b>t</b><b> with the peels of </b><b><i>orla</i></b> fruit, <b>or with</b><b> straw </b>of grain that was planted in a prohibited mixture <b>of diverse kinds in a vineyard, </b>if it was a <b>new </b>oven, and by lighting it he hardened the oven and made it stronger for use in the future, then <b>it </b>must <b>be shattered. </b>Since prohibited items were used in the process of forming the oven, one may not derive benefit from the use of the prohibited items. However, if it was an <b>old </b>oven, <b>it </b>may <b>be cooled</b><b>, </b>and it is prohibited to use the oven only while it is still hot.", 
            "With regard to <b>one </b>who <b>baked bread in </b>the oven while it was heated or strengthened by the prohibited items, <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is prohibited </b>to eat or derive benefit from <b>the bread, </b>since prohibited items were involved in the process of preparation. <b>And the Rabbis say: It is permitted </b>to eat and derive benefit from <b>the bread. </b>If <b>he</b><b> cooked </b>the bread <b>over the coals </b>that remained from prohibited wood, <b>everyone agrees </b>that <b>it is permitted. </b>",

By cooling the oven one no longer derives benefit from the prohibited items used to light it, and there is no need to shatter the oven.", 
            "The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>Say </b>that <b>you heard that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi prohibits one from deriving benefit from bread baked using the prohibited objects as kindling <b>because there is improvement</b><b> from the wood </b>used to light the oven <b>in the</b><b> bread</b><b>,</b> and therefore, it is prohibited.

            "<b>Rather, Rava</b><b> said: If it was difficult for </b>Rami bar Ḥama, <b>this is </b>what he found <b>difficult: Didn’t the kindler</b> of the fire transgress the prohibition of <b>misuse </b>of <b>consecrated</b><b> property, </b>as anyone who unwittingly uses consecrated property for a non-sacred use violates this prohibition? <b>And any </b>case <b>where</b><b> the kindler </b>of an oven <b>misuses consecrated propert</b><b>y</b> by doing so, the wood <b>is transferred to non-sacred </b>status. The wood loses its sanctity when misused, and the one who misused it must donate other wood to the Temple in its place. In that case, the wood used to heat the oven is non-sacred wood and the bread should be permitted.", 
            "<b>Rav </b><b>Pappa said: Here, we are dealing with wood </b>which had been set aside <b>for </b>purchasing <b>peace-offerings. </b>This wood, while sanctified, has a lesser status of sanctity and does not become fully consecrated until the blood of the offering has been sprinkled. <b>And </b>this dilemma was raised <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, </b>who <b>said: </b>If one <b>unwittingly</b> misused <b>consecrated property, it becomes desecrated </b>and loses its elevated status. However, if one used the object <b>intentionally, it </b><b>is not desecrated </b>and remains consecrated. Since the act here is intentional, the consecrated wood does not lose its status.", 
            "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason </b>that when one <b>intentionally </b>uses this object it does <b>not </b>lose its status? <b>Since </b>it is <b>not subject to </b>the <i>halakha</i> of <b>misuse of consecrated property, </b>as one is liable to bring an offering only for unwitting misuse of consecrated property, <b>it is not transferred to</b><b> non-sacred </b>status.

Since </b>at that stage <b>it is not subject to </b>the <i>halakha</i> of <b>misuse of consecrated property, </b>as that applies only after the animal’s blood has been sprinkled, then according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, even if one unwittingly uses this wood, <b>it is not transferred to non-sacred </b>status; rather, it remains prohibited.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And anywhere the kindler </b>of an oven transgresses the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property </b>by using consecrated wood, <b>is it transferred to non-sacred </b>status? <b>Wasn’t </b>it <b>taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all </b>prohibited items <b>that must be burned, their ashes</b><b> are permitted </b>after the burning, <b>except for wood from an</b> <b><i>asheira</i></b><b>.</b><b> And consecrated as</b><b>h</b><b> is prohibited forever. </b>Therefore, it is possible that when one kindles an oven with this consecrated wood, although he misuses consecrated property, the ash remains prohibited.", 
            "<b>Rami bar Ḥama said: </b>That <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where a fire began on its own among consecrated </b><b>wood and there is no one who misused consecrated property. </b>Since this is the case, even the ash that is left from this wood remains consecrated property and one may not benefit from it. <b>Rav Shemaya said: </b>This <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with those </b>types of consecrated ash <b>that require burial, </b>such as the ash removed from the altar. <b>As it </b><b>was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: “And he shall take up the ash from where the fire has consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put it beside the altar” (Leviticus 6:3). The phrase <b>“And he shall put</b><b> it” </b>indicates that he must do so <b>gently; “and he</b><b> shall put it” </b>also indicates that he must place <b>all</b><b> of it; “and he shall put it” </b>also indicates <b>that</b><b> he </b>may <b>not scatter </b>the ashes. Apparently, even after the offering has been burned it remains sacred, and one may not derive benefit from it.

            "<b>And </b><b>by right it </b>should have <b>taught </b>that <b>even the eating </b>of leavened bread belonging to a gentile <b>is permitted </b>after the conclusion of Passover, <b>but since </b>the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught that </b><b>it is forbidden to </b>derive <b>benefit from </b>leavened bread belonging to <b>a Jew </b>after Passover, <b>he also taught </b>that <b>it</b><b> is permitted to </b>derive <b>benefit from </b>leavened bread belonging to <b>a gentile. </b>However, one should understand that it is permitted to eat this leavened bread as well. <b>And </b>similarly, <b>by</b><b> right it </b>should have <b>taught that </b>even during Passover <b>it</b><b> is permitted to </b>derive <b>benefit from </b>leavened bread that belongs to gentiles. <b>But since </b>the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught </b>about the leavened bread belonging to a <b>Jew after </b>Passover, <b>he also taught</b> about the leavened bread belonging to a gentile <b>after </b>Passover.

            "<b>Rava said: </b>This is not so. <b>Actually </b>our mishna <b>is </b>in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. </b>However, this is difficult, as Rabbi Shimon states that it is permitted for a Jew to derive benefit from leavened bread that had been owned by another Jew during Passover, while our mishna explicitly states that this is forbidden. This can be resolved by explaining that <b>Rabbi</b><b> Shimon </b>argues that it is permitted only according to Torah law. However, one who intentionally commits such a transgression <b>incurs</b><b> a penalty. Since he transgresse</b><b>d</b> the prohibition <b>it shall </b><b>not be seen and </b>the prohibition <b>it shall not be </b><b>found, </b>the Sages decreed that it is forbidden for him to derive benefit from this leavened bread.", 
            "The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to </b>the opinion of <b>Rava, this </b>explanation <b>is </b>consistent with <b>that </b><b>which was taught </b>in the mishna: Leavened bread that <b>belonged </b><b>to a Jew is forbidden because it is stated: “It </b><b>shall not be seen” </b>(Exodus 13:7). According to this explanation, the connection between the prohibition against deriving benefit from leavened bread that was owned by a Jew during Passover and the verse prohibiting seeing leaven during Passover is clear. The prohibition against deriving benefit from this leavened bread is a rabbinically instituted fine for transgressing the Torah prohibition of “It shall not be seen.” <b>But according to </b>the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, </b>which states that our mishna follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, and which renders forbidden by Torah law deriving benefit from leavened bread that was owned by a Jew during Passover, why is this verse cited? The mishna <b>should have said </b>that it is forbidden <b>due to </b>the verse <b>“Leavened bread shall not be</b><b> eaten” </b>(Exodus 13:3), as that is the verse from which Rabbi Yehuda derives this prohibition.", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Do you hold </b>that this proof <b>is referring to the latter clause </b>of the mishna, where the prohibition against deriving benefit from leavened bread owned by a Jew is discussed? <b>It is referring to the first</b><b> clause </b>of the mishna, which discusses permission to derive benefit from leavened bread owned by a gentile, <b>and this is</b> what <b>it is saying: Leavened bread of a gentile, over</b><b> which Passover has elapsed, </b>i.e., that remains after the conclusion of Passover, <b>it is permissible to </b>derive <b>benefit from</b> it, <b>due to </b>the verse where <b>it is stated: “It</b><b> shall not be seen by you.” </b>This indicates that <b>you</b><b> may not see your own </b>leaven, <b>but you may </b><b>see </b>leaven that belongs <b>to others and </b>leaven consecrated <b>to </b><b>God.

            "The Gemara comments that Rava and Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>follow their </b>line of <b>reasoning.

            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: </b><b>Since </b>the statement of <b>Rava bar Ahilai was refuted, why </b><b>did Rav say </b>that <b>pots </b>that were used for leavened bread <b>on Passover </b>should <b>be broken? </b>Presumably, their status could be remedied in the same way as was that of this oven, by heating them on a fire until the flavor of the leavened bread absorbed in them was removed. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: </b>There is a distinction between these two cases. <b>There, </b>it is referring to <b>a metal </b><b>oven, </b>which can be cleansed through an additional kindling, while <b>here, </b>it is referring <b>to an earthenware pot, </b>where additional kindling is insufficient, as the earthenware has the capacity to absorb more of the flavor of the leavened bread and it cannot be purged by fire. ", 
            "<b>If </b><b>you wish, say </b>instead that <b>both this, </b>the oven, <b>and </b><b>that, </b>the pot, <b>are earthenware, </b>but that the following distinction applies. <b>This, </b>the oven, <b>is kindled from the inside, </b>and as the fire is kindled inside the oven itself, it consumes the absorbed flavor of the leavened bread. While <b>that, </b>the pot, <b>is kindled from the outside, </b>such that the flavor of the prohibited material absorbed in the pot is not purged by the fire. <b>And if you say, </b><b>so too </b>here, in the case of the pot, <b>he</b><b> should perform the kindling </b>procedure on the pots from the <b>inside </b>to remove that which has been absorbed, this is not reasonable. Presumably, the owner of the pot will <b>be</b><b> concerned lest it burst </b>if he makes the pot too hot. Therefore, he will not use sufficient heat to ensure that the leavened bread that has been absorbed will be completely purged. ", 
            "The Gemara concludes: <b>Therefore, </b>based on this principle, <b>this griddle </b>made from earthenware tiles that was used to bake bread is a type of oven where <b>the kindling is from the outside and </b>therefore <b>prohibited</b><b>. But if he fills it with </b>burning <b>coals, </b>then <b>it</b><b> seems well </b>and it can be used afterward. Because this vessel is often subject to a high level of heat, the owner will not be concerned that it will break when heated. ", 
            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: </b>With regard to <b>these knives</b><b>,</b><b> how do we prepare them</b> for use <b>during Passover? </b>Rav Ashi <b>said to him: For</b><b> me, </b>personally, <b>we craft new ones. </b>Ravina <b>said to </b><b>him: </b>It works out <b>well for Master, as you are </b><b>able </b>to afford new knives. However, <b>what </b>should <b>one who </b><b>is unable </b>to purchase new knives do? <b>He said to</b><b> him: I was speaking of </b>making them <b>like new </b>by thoroughly cleaning them in the following manner: One should cover <b>the </b>wooden <b>handles in mud, </b>so that they will not be burned, and heat <b>the metal with fire </b>until it is white-hot. <b>And then I place the handles </b>of the knives <b>in boiling water </b>in order to remove anything that had been absorbed into the wood. <b>And the </b><b><i>halakha</i></b><b> is </b>that with regard to both <b>this, </b>the blade, and <b>that, </b>the handle, it is sufficient to immerse them <b>in boiling water, </b>so long as this water is still <b>in a primary vessel</b><b>.</b> The water must still be in the original pot in which it was boiled and not poured from another pot.

            "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: A wooden </b><b>ladl</b><b>e</b> should <b>be purged in boiling water in a primary</b><b> vessel </b>in order to remove the flavor of the forbidden food that it absorbed. The Gemara states: He <b>holds </b>in accordance with the principle: <b>As it absorbs </b>the flavor of the forbidden substance, <b>so it emits it. </b>The same cooking method and level of heat that caused the flavor of the forbidden substance to be absorbed in the vessel suffices to discharge the flavor of that substance from the vessel. Therefore, a ladle that absorbed flavor of leavened bread from a pot of boiling water which was over a fire will discharge the flavor of leavened bread once it is placed in the boiling water again.",

            "Ameimar <b>said to him: I saw that </b>some of the liquid <b>is expelled [</b><b><i>demidayeti</i></b><b>]</b><b>?</b> from the outside of the vessel. <b>Apparently they absorb and are </b>therefore <b>prohibited, </b>as they cannot be prepared for use on Passover through cleansing, <b>and the Torah testified about earthenware vessels </b>that when they absorb the flavor of a prohibited substance, <b>they will never</b><b> leave their defective </b>status and they remain permanently prohibited. The Torah states that a person may cleanse other vessels by scouring and rinsing them, whereas it states that earthenware vessels must be broken. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different </b>about <b>wine </b>used for a <b>libation, </b>with regard to which the <i>halakha</i> of earthenware vessels is more lenient? <b>As Mareimar </b><b>taught: A glazed </b>earthenware <b>vessel is permitted whether it is </b><b>black, white, or green </b>if it was used to store wine belonging to gentiles.

", 
            "The Gemara continues discussing the ways that a vessel must be cleansed so that it can be used during Passover. <b>Rava bar Abba said </b><b>that Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said that Shmuel said: Any </b><b>vessel that was used for leavened bread </b>only <b>while cool </b><b>can be used for </b><b><i>matza</i></b><b>,</b> because no flavor of the leavened bread was absorbed by the vessel. The <b>exception </b>to this rule is <b>the leaven container </b>where the yeast was stored, <b>since its leavening is </b>more <b>potent, </b>and it can be assumed that the flavor from the yeast has entered the walls of the vessel even without heat. <b>Rav</b><b> Ashi said: And the spice container, </b>in which potent spices that contained flour were stored, <b>has the same </b>status <b>as</b><b> the leaven container whose leavening is potent</b><b>.</b> ", 
            "<b>Rava said: </b>With regard to <b>certain bowls</b><b> of Meḥoza, since it is common to knead leavened bread</b><b> in them and </b>then <b>store the leavened bread in them</b><b>, they are considered to be like a leaven container whose</b><b> leavening is potent</b><b>.</b> The Gemara asks: Why did Rava find it necessary to make this statement? Isn’t it <b>obvious </b>that these bowls are the same as a leaven container? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say </b>that <b>since </b>these bowls <b>are spacious, the air dominates them and they do</b><b> not absorb </b>the leavened bread in the same way as does a leaven container, therefore, <b>he teaches us </b>that no such distinction applies.", 
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a gentile </b><b>lent money to a </b><b>Jew</b><b>,</b> and the Jew gave him <b>leavened bread as </b>collateral until after Passover, and <b>after</b><b> Passover </b>the gentile retains this leavened bread in lieu of payment, then <b>one is permitted to </b>derive <b>benefit from </b>this leavened bread.

Since this leavened bread was considered to be in the Jew’s property during Passover, it is forbidden to derive benefit from it afterward.", 
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated </b>that the <i>amora’im</i> disagree about the rights of a <b>creditor </b>with regard to collateral. <b>Abaye said: He retroactively collects </b>the property. In a case where the creditor had a lien on the property of the debtor and the debtor defaults on the loan, it is considered as if the creditor acquired rights to the collateral at the time of the loan and not at the time of collection. <b>And Rava said</b><b>: </b>This is not the case, but rather, <b>he acquires </b>the collateral <b>from that point forward, </b>and has rights to the collateral only from the time that the loan was due. This dispute has ramifications for the status of the property, and actions undertaken with regard to it, during the intervening period. The Gemara sets several limitations on the scope of this dispute: <b>Anywhere that the debtor consecrated or sold </b>the field that was serving as collateral, <b>everyone agrees </b>that <b>the</b><b> creditor can come and seize </b>this property and override the sale, because its status as collateral preceded its sale. "
        ], 
        [
            "<b>Or </b>if the debtor consecrated the property, the creditor can <b>come and redeem </b>it through a symbolic payment to the Temple. <b>As we learned </b>in a mishna: The creditor may <b>add an additional dina</b><b>r</b> to the amount of the loan <b>and redee</b><b>m</b><b> this property. </b>Although strictly speaking he need not redeem it, this payment was instituted so that it would not appear as though property were removed from the consecrated Temple jurisdiction without a payment. <b>When they disagree </b>is in a case <b>when the creditor sold or consecrated </b>the property in the interim between the giving of the collateral and the time the loan was due. ", 
            "<b>Abaye said: He retroactively acquires </b>the collateral. <b>Since the time arrived and he did not repay </b>his loan, <b>it has become clear retroactively that it was in</b> the creditor’s <b>jurisdiction at the outset. </b>Therefore, <b>he did</b><b> well to consecrate or sell </b>it. However, <b>Rava said: He</b><b> collects it from that point forward, since if the </b>borrower <b>had money he would remove the </b>creditor’s lien <b>with</b> this <b>money </b>and the lender would not acquire the property. <b>It is found </b>that the creditor <b>acquires </b>the property <b>now</b><b>, </b>at the time when the loan is due, and consequently he did not have the right to consecrate or sell it before this time.", 
            "Before bringing proofs for either side of this dispute, the Gemara attempts to clarify Rava’s position. <b>Did Rava </b>actually <b>say this? </b>A statement he makes in a different context appears to contradict the one made in his name here. <b>But didn’t Rami bar Ḥama say</b><b>: Reuven sold a fiel</b><b>d</b><b> to Shimon with a guarantee </b>that if the field is repossessed, Reuven will compensate Shimon for his loss. Shimon did not pay for the purchase, and instead <b>set up </b>the value of the field <b>as a loan. </b>In the meantime, <b>Reuven died and a</b><b> creditor of Reuven’s came </b>to collect for a loan that Reuven had taken before he sold the field, as Reuven had no other land remaining, and he <b>seized </b>the land <b>from Shimon, </b>since it was mortgaged to this loan. <b>And Shimon went and appeased </b>the creditor <b>with money </b>so the creditor would allow him to keep this field. ", 
            "<b>By right, Reuven’s sons </b>can <b>come and </b><b>say to Shimon </b>that he must pay them the money that he owes for the field. And they are not required to pay Shimon if he demands compensation for the repossession of his field. They can say that <b>our father </b><b>left us movable property in your hands, </b>i.e., the money you owe us for the field, <b>and, </b>as a general rule, <b>movable property that has been left to orphans</b><b> is not mortgaged to a creditor</b><b>.</b> The orphans can claim that the field belongs to Shimon, and as there is no land left for the orphans, there is no way for Shimon to recover the compensation that he is owed. The money he owes Reuven is considered movable property, and therefore he cannot recover his losses from these funds. ", 
            "<b>And Rava said</b> with regard to this case: <b>If Shimon is cleve</b><b>r</b> <b>he will pay them </b>what he owes with <b>real estate </b>and not with money. Since they now have real estate received from their father’s estate, Shimon <b>can then collect </b>the field <b>from them </b>as compensation for the original field that Reuven sold to Shimon. <b>As Rav Naḥman said: </b>When <b>orphans collect real estat</b><b>e</b><b> for a debt owed to their</b><b> father </b>from one person, another <b>creditor can come and seize</b><b> this </b>land <b>from them </b>in order to repay the father’s debt. ", 
            "The Gemara applies this discussion to our original case. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that a creditor <b>collects retroactively, </b>and the field is considered as though it belonged to the creditor from the time of the loan, <b>due to this </b>reason, <b>he can then</b><b> collect </b>the money <b>from them, because it is considered as</b><b> though he collected it during their father’s lifetime. </b>Because the field given by Shimon to repay his debt retroactively belonged to Reuven from the time that Shimon agreed to pay for the field, therefore Shimon can now claim this land from Reuven’s heirs. <b>However, if you say </b>that <b>he collects </b>it <b>from this point forward, why can </b><b>he then collect </b>this land <b>from them? It is as </b><b>though the orphans purchased this property. And if orphans buy </b><b>property, does </b>it become <b>indebted to a creditor </b>of their father? Only property that belonged to the father can be seized in order to pay back his debt, and therefore Rava’s statement in the case appears to contradict his statement with regard to the transfer of ownership of collateral. ", 
            "The Gemara resolves this contradiction: <b>It is different there, </b>in this case, <b>as </b>Shimon could have <b>said to </b>Reuven’s children that <b>just as</b><b> I am indebted to your father, so too, I am</b><b> indebted to your father’s creditor. </b>And this principle can be learned <b>from </b>the statement <b>of Rabbi Natan </b>that one who lends to one person and borrows from another can be considered as a middleman between his creditor and his borrower. <b>As it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rabbi Natan</b><b> says: From where </b>is it derived <b>that when one lends</b><b> one hundred </b>dinar <b>[</b><b><i>maneh</i></b><b>] to his fellow, and that fellow</b> lends a similar sum <b>to </b>a third <b>fellow, that we</b><b> take </b>the money <b>from this one, </b>the second debtor, <b>and give it to that one, </b>the first creditor, without going through the middleman, who is both the first debtor and the second creditor? <b>The verse states: “And he </b><b>shall give it to him whom he has wronged” </b>(Numbers 5:7), which indicates that the loan should be repaid to the creditor to whom the money is ultimately owed. Therefore, payment is made to the original creditor regardless of the issue of retroactive acquisition of the collateral. ", 
            "The Gemara proceeds to bring proofs for the two sides of the question of retroactive acquisition. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>a gentile lent money to a</b><b> Jew, </b>and the Jew gave him <b>leavened bread as </b>collateral during Passover, and <b>after Passover </b>the gentile attained this leavened bread in lieu of payment, then <b>one is permitted </b><b>to </b>derive <b>benefit from </b>the leavened bread. The Gemara attempts to clarify this position: <b>Granted, if you say </b>that <b>he</b><b> retroactively collects </b>this property, and the leavened bread was acquired retroactively by the gentile, <b>it is due to this </b>that <b>one is permitted to </b>derive <b>benefit from it </b>after Passover. ", 
            "<b>But if you say </b>that <b>he collects </b><b>it from this point forward, </b>then <b>why </b>should <b>one be </b><b>permitted to </b>derive <b>benefit from </b>this leavened bread? The leavened bread <b>was in the possession of a Jew </b>during Passover, and therefore it should be forbidden. The Gemara answers: <b>With</b><b> what are we dealing here? </b>With a case where <b>he</b><b> deposited [</b><b><i>hirhin</i></b><b>]</b> the leavened bread <b>with </b>the gentile in his home, and since the leavened bread was in the gentile’s possession during Passover, it is considered as if it belonged to the gentile, provided the gentile ultimately retains ownership of the leavened bread when the Jew defaults on the loan. ", 
            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say </b>that this dispute is <b>parallel to </b>a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b><b>. </b>As it was taught: If <b>a Jew lends money to a gentile </b>and the gentile gives him <b>leavened bread as </b>collateral, <b>then </b>the Jew <b>does</b><b> not commit any transgression after Passover. They said in the</b><b> name of Rabbi Meir that he commits a transgression</b><b>.</b><b> What, isn’t it that they disagree about this, that</b><b> one Sage, </b>Rabbi Meir, <b>holds </b>that the Jew transgresses by owning leavened bread <b>because he retroactively collects </b>the leavened bread and has therefore owned it during Passover, <b>and one Sage</b><b>, </b>who states that the Jew does not commit a transgression, <b>holds </b>that <b>he collects it from this point forward, </b>and therefore it was not considered to be in his possession during Passover? ", 
            "The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>And </b>how can <b>you understand</b> it that way? <b>Say the latter clause </b>of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>However, if a gentile lends </b>money <b>to a Jew </b><b>with leavened bread </b>as collateral, then <b>after Passover everyone agrees</b><b> that he commits a transgression. However, </b>if the preceding explanation is correct, <b>it needed </b>to state <b>the opposite </b>of what it said in the first clause, as the case in the latter clause is the reverse of that in the first clause. Namely, <b>according to the one who </b><b>said there, </b>in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>he does not commit a transgression, </b>he should say that <b>here, </b>in this case, <b>he does commit a transgression. </b><b>And according to the one who said there, </b>in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>he does commit a </b><b>transgression, </b>he should say that <b>here, </b>in the latter clause, <b>he does not commit a transgression. </b>For if the creditor retroactively acquires the collateral, then it is as though it belonged to a gentile during Passover, and therefore the Jew would not have committed a transgression by owning it.

            "<b>Rather, with what are we dealing here? </b>With a situation <b>where he, </b>the gentile debtor, <b>deposited </b>the leavened bread that was serving as collateral <b>with him, </b>the Jewish creditor, <b>and they disagree with regard to </b>the statement <b>of</b><b> Rabbi Yitzḥak. As Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where </b>is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collatera</b><b>l</b> given to him, and is considered its owner so long as the item is in his possession? <b>As it is stated: </b>“You shall surely return the pledge to him when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you; <b>and it shall be a righteousness for you</b> before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 24:13). Rabbi Yitzḥak infers: <b>If </b>the creditor <b>does not acquire the collateral, </b>then <b>from</b><b> where is the righteousness </b>involved in returning it? In this case, the creditor would not be giving up anything of his own. <b>From here </b>it is learned <b>that a</b><b> creditor acquires the collateral.</b>", 
            "The Gemara applies this principle to the explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The first</b> <b><i>tanna</i></b><b> holds </b>that <b>this applies only when a Jew </b>takes collateral <b>from a </b>fellow <b>Jew, such that I would read</b> and apply the verse <b>“It shall be righteousness for </b><b>you” </b>and establish that the collateral becomes the property of the lender. <b>However, </b>the verse does not speak about the case where <b>a Jew </b>takes collateral <b>from a gentile, </b>and therefore <b>he does not acquire </b>the collateral; it still belongs to the gentile. Therefore, when a Jew has leavened bread as collateral from a gentile to whom he lent money on Passover, he does not violate any prohibition, as the collateral still belongs to the gentile. ", 
            "However, <b>Rabbi Meir holds </b>that one can derive <b>an </b><b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b><b> inference: </b>If <b>a Jew acquires </b>collateral <b>from</b> another <b>Jew, all the more so </b>is it <b>not </b>clear that he will he acquire collateral <b>from a gentile? However</b><b>, </b>with regard to <b>a gentile who lends money to a</b><b> Jew with leavened bread as </b>collateral, <b>everyone agrees </b>that <b>he transgresses </b>this prohibition after Passover. <b>There, </b>in that case, <b>the gentile certainly does not acquire </b>collateral <b>from the</b><b> Jew, </b>and such a transaction could be completed only via the usual modes of acquisition.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>He holds in accordance </b><b>with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana, as it </b><b>was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana rendered </b>the status of <b>Yom Kippur the same as </b>that of <b>Shabbat with regard to payment. </b>In his opinion, not only a person who committed a transgression punishable by a court-administered capital punishment, like one who desecrated Shabbat, is exempt from monetary payment incurred at the time of the transgression.

            "After mentioning ways in which impure <i>teruma</i> was used, the Gemara mentions other <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to this issue. <b>Abaye bar Avin and Rav Ḥananya bar </b><b>Avin taught </b>the tractate of <b><i>Terumot</i></b><b> in the school of </b><b>Rabba.

", 
            "Abaye bar Avin and Rav Ḥananya bar Avin <b>said </b><b>to </b>Rava bar Mattana: <b>This is what Rabba said </b>in explaining this mishna: <b>What </b>does it mean that <b>they are</b><b> prohibited </b>to be eaten? It means that <b>they are prohibited</b> to be eaten <b>by non-priests, </b>but a priest may eat them. Once these saplings are planted, they lose their ritual impurity but retain their status as <i>teruma</i>. Rava bar Mattana challenged this answer: If this is the case, <b>what</b><b> is </b>the mishna <b>teaching us </b>with this statement? Is it teaching us that <b>growths of </b><b><i>teruma</i></b> are considered <b><i>teruma</i></b><b>? </b>It is unnecessary to teach this principle, as <b>we </b>already <b>learned</b><b>: Growths of </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b>, </b>i.e., produce that grows from <i>terum</i><i>a</i> that was planted in the ground, are considered <b><i>teruma</i></b><b>.</b> Why, then, is it necessary to teach this principle again?

            "<b>And if you </b><b>say </b>as follows: This case is referring to <b>the growths </b><b>of growths </b>of <i>teruma</i>, i.e., plants that grew from the original growths of <i>teruma</i>, and <b>what is it teaching</b><b> us? </b>It is teaching that <b>an item whose seed </b><b>does not disintegrate </b>when planted in the ground maintains its <i>teruma</i> status. While most seeds will disintegrate, other plants, such as onions and garlic, merely continue growing when planted. In that case, this mishna would be informing us that even the growths of growths of such plants retain their <i>teruma</i> status.

            "<b>They said to</b> Rava bar Mattana: <b>Have you heard something in this </b>regard? <b>He said to them: This is what Rav Sheshet </b><b>said: What </b>is the meaning of the word <b>prohibited </b>in this context?

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted</b><b>, according to the one who says </b>that a <b>diversion </b><b>of attention constitutes an inherent disqualification</b><b>,</b><b> it works out </b><b>well. </b>According to this opinion, a diversion of attention does not disqualify <i>teruma</i> due to a concern that it became impure.

If this is the case with regard to <i>teruma</i> that is certainly impure, all the more so should it apply to a case where there is only a chance that the <i>teruma</i> is ritually impure.", 
            "Apropos the discussion of diversion of attention, the Gemara cites a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> with regard to this issue, <b>as it</b><b> was stated: </b>What is the nature of the disqualification of <b>diversion of attention?

            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an </b><b>objection to </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish </b>based on what is taught in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son </b><b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: There was a small gap</b><b> between the ramp and the altar on the western</b> side <b>of the ramp, where they would throw disqualified birds</b> that had been designated as <b>sin-offerings. </b>If birds became disqualified for any reason, such as a diversion of attention, they were left there <b>until their form decayed, </b>i.e., until the next morning, at which point they would be definitively disqualified due to remaining in the Temple overnight and could be <b>taken out to the place </b>designated for <b>burning.

            "The Gemara clarifies: To <b>what</b> type of <b>disqualification </b>is the <i>baraita</i> referring? <b>Is it not</b> disqualification on account of <b>a diversion of attention? </b>It cannot be a case where it was disqualified due to impurity or being taken outside of the walls, since these are mentioned explicitly. <b>Granted, if you say </b>that a diversion of attention is <b>a disqualification </b>based on a concern about <b>ritual</b><b> impurity, this is </b>how <b>you </b>can <b>find </b>a case that the offering is accepted <b>because the frontplate atones </b>for cases where there is a disqualification related to ritual impurity. <b>But if you say that it is an inherent </b><b>disqualification, why </b>is the offering <b>accepted </b>according to Rabbi Yehoshua, given that it is a disqualified offering?

            "Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish rejects this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: No, this is not a case where the offering was disqualified due to a diversion of attention.

            "Rav Dimi <b>said </b><b>to him: I did not hear </b>the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>this </b>case; however, <b>I heard </b>the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a similar case.

            "<b>Rav Yosef said: </b>This case does not serve as a proof since <b>you </b><b>spoke of grapes, and here we are dealing with grapes </b><b>of </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b>, whose consecration through speech is comparable to consecration</b><b> in a </b>sacred <b>vessel, </b>as <i>teruma</i> cannot be consecrated by being placed in a sacred vessel. <b>However, </b>with regard to <b>those </b>items <b>that require a </b>sacred <b>vessel </b>in order to be fully consecrated, such as water used for a libation, <b>the Sages did not impose a higher </b>standard in a case where one consecrated it <b>through speech. </b>Therefore, this case cannot be used to resolve Abaye’s question. ", 
            "The Gemara asks about Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement with regard to wine pressed from impure grapes: The phrase <b>if one tread upon them </b>is stated without qualification, indicating that the wine is ritually pure <b>even </b>if he pressed <b>many </b>grapes at once. <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </b>actually <b>say this? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: </b>With regard to <b>grapes that became ritually impure grapes, one </b>should <b>tread </b><b>on them less than an egg-bulk at a time. </b>When there is less than an egg-bulk of grapes, they do not impart ritual impurity. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say </b>this answer: <b>Here, too, </b>it is to be understood that one must tread on <b>less than an egg-bulk at </b><b>a time.

When a liquid touches an object that is impure with second-degree ritual impurity, it becomes impure by rabbinic decree with first-degree ritual impurity.

            "<b>Rava said: We, too, have learned </b>that the Sages created higher standards with regard to consecrated items.

            "<b>Rav Shimi bar</b><b> Ashi said: We, too, learned </b>a similar statement in a <i>baraita</i>: When the period of ritual impurity of a <i>zav</i> or leper has been completed, and he <b>immersed </b>during the day <b>and emerged, </b>he may <b>eat tithes </b>immediately.

            "The Gemara responds: <b>Come </b>and <b>hear </b>a resolution to this question, <b>as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi </b><b>Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: Rice is </b>a full-fledged <b>type </b><b>of grain. </b>Therefore, <b>one is liable </b>to receive <b><i>karet</i></b><b> for</b> eating it in <b>its leavened </b>state, <b>and a person </b>can <b>fulfill his obligation </b>to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with it on </b><b>Passover. </b>This <i>baraita</i> clearly indicates that, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, rice becomes leavened like other grains, and the expression: It is close to becoming leavened, means that it becomes leavened quicker than other grains.

            "The mishna taught that one can fulfill the obligation to eat <i>matza</i> with produce of the <b>first tithe from </b><b>which its </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b>, </b>the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <b>was taken </b>and given to a priest.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>No, </b>it is <b>necessary </b>to teach the <i>halakha</i> in a case where a Levite <b>preceded </b>the priest while the grain was still <b>on </b>its <b>stalks</b><b>.</b> Ordinarily, the Levite would be given his first tithe only after the priest had taken the <i>teruma</i> <i>gedola</i>; however, in this case the Levite took his portion before the priest. <b>And the </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b> of the tithe was </b><b>taken </b>by the Levite from his tithe so that he would be permitted to eat the tithe; however, <b>the </b><b><i>teruma</i></b> <b><i>gedola</i></b><b> was not taken from </b>the produce at all. <b>And</b> the novel element of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu. </b>",

            "The mishna taught that one can fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> with <b>second-tithe </b>grain <b>and </b>with <b>consecrated </b>grain <b>that was redeemed. </b>The Gemara asks: It is <b>obvious </b>that this is the case, as consecrated grain that has been redeemed is non-sacred produce. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here? </b>We are dealing with a case where the consecrated property was not completely redeemed, i.e., <b>where one gave </b>payment for <b>the principal, </b>the value of the tithe, <b>but he did not give </b>payment for the additional <b>fifth </b>due when redeeming consecrated items. <b>And </b>the mishna <b>teaches us </b>that failure to add <b>the </b><b>fifth does not invalidate </b>the redemption.

            "<b>Rather, </b>this <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>untithed produce that</b><b> was incompletely amended. </b>How so?

            "<b>The verse states: “You shall </b><b>not eat leavened bread with it; </b>seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>” (Deuteronomy 16:3).

            "The Gemara expresses surprise at this <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b><b> the prohibition of leavened bread, where did it go? </b>In other words, doesn’t the prohibition: “You shall not eat leavened bread” apply to untithed produce as well? <b>Rav Sheshet</b><b> said: </b>In accordance with <b>whose </b>opinion <b>is this </b><i>baraita</i>? <b>It</b><b> is </b>in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who</b><b> said: One prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition</b> already exists. No additional prohibitions can apply to an object that is already prohibited, e.g., untithed grain.

The prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur does not apply to the already prohibited meat of an animal carcass, which means only the prohibition against eating an unslaughtered animal carcass is violated by this act. ", 
            "<b>Ravina said: Even </b>if <b>you say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis, </b>who maintain that a prohibition can take effect where another prohibition already exists, it can be explained as follows: One fulfills his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with </b>food <b>whose prohibition </b>is <b>solely due to </b>the commandment: <b>Do not eat leavened bread</b><b>, </b>which <b>excludes this </b>grain, <b>which is forbidden not only </b><b>due to </b>the prohibition: <b>Do not eat leavened bread, but </b><b>also due to </b>the prohibition: <b>Do not eat untithed produce.</b> ", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty against this explanation: <b>Is </b>the word: <b>Only, written </b>in the <i>baraita</i>?

            "<b>The </b><b>Sages taught: </b>I <b>might </b>have thought that <b>a person can </b><b>fulfill his obligation </b>to eat <b><i>matza</i></b> on Passover <b>with </b><i>matza</i> of <b>second tith</b><b>e</b><b> in Jerusalem. </b>Therefore, <b>the verse states: </b>“You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat with it <i>matza</i>, <b>the bread of </b><b>affliction [</b><b><i>leḥem</i></b> <b><i>oni</i></b><b>]</b><b>”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), <i>oni</i> with the letter <i>ayin</i>, i.e., poor man’s bread.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>does <b>Rabbi Akiva maintain</b> with regard to <b>dough that was kneaded with wine, oil</b><b>, or honey, </b>that it may <b>not </b>be used for <i>matza</i>? <b>But wasn’t it taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One </b>may <b>not knead dough on Passover with wine, oil, or honey</b><b>?

            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And although one </b>may <b>not knead </b>dough with these ingredients, <b>one </b>may <b>spread </b>these substances on the surface of the dough.

            "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult, </b>as <b>this </b>statement of Rabbi Akiva’s, which maintains that one does not fulfill his obligation with <i>matza</i> prepared with wine, oil, and honey, is referring to <b>the first day of the Festival, </b>during which there is a special commandment to eat <i>matza</i>.

On the second day, there is no mitzva to eat <i>matza</i>. It is only forbidden to own or eat leavened bread; consequently so-called rich, or enhanced <i>matza</i>, prepared from fruit juices, is permitted. ", 
            "The Gemara adds that this is <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua said to his sons: </b>On <b>the</b><b> first night </b>of Passover, <b>do not knead for me </b>dough <b>with milk, </b>but <b>from </b>the first night <b>onward, knead </b>my dough for <b>me with milk. </b>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But wasn’t it taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: Throughout the whole year <b>one </b>may <b>not knead dough with milk, and</b><b> if he kneaded </b>dough with milk, <b>the entire bread is</b><b> prohibited, due to </b>the fact that one will become <b>accustomed</b><b> to sin, </b>by unwittingly eating it with meat? <b>Rather</b><b>, this is what he is saying: </b>On <b>the first </b>night of Passover <b>do not knead me </b>dough <b>with honey; </b>however, <b>from then onward, knead me </b>dough <b>with honey. </b>", 
            "<b>And if you wish</b><b>, say </b>instead that <b>actually, </b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: <b>With milk, as</b><b> Ravina said: </b>If this bread, kneaded with milk, is prepared in the shape <b>of an ox’s eye, it is</b><b> permitted. </b>In other words, if one forms this dough in a unique shape, e.g., the eye of an ox, one may eat it, as it is clearly distinguishable from ordinary bread. Therefore, there is no concern that it will be eaten with meat. <b>Here too, </b>the <i>baraita</i> is speaking about a case where he told them to prepare this <i>matza</i> in the shape <b>of an ox’s eye.</b>", 
            "It was incidentally mentioned in the previous <i>baraita</i>: <b>And everyone </b><b>agrees that one </b>may <b>not knead dough with warm </b>water. The Gemara asks: In <b>what </b>way <b>is </b>this case <b>different</b><b> from </b>that of <b>meal-offerings</b><b>?</b><b> As we learned </b>in a mishna: <b>All meal-offerings are kneaded with warm wate</b><b>r</b><b> and are watched so that they will not be </b><b>leavened. </b>The Gemara explains that there is a distinction between these two cases: <b>If they say </b>it is permitted <b>for </b><b>diligent </b>priests to bake with warm water, <b>shall they </b>also <b>say </b>the same with regard <b>to those who are not </b><b>diligent? </b>The priests are diligent and expert in the Temple service and are able to take extreme care, but not everyone can be relied upon to guard the dough unfailingly. ", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so, </b>if we rely on the diligence of the priests, <b>let them also soak </b>the grains in water to help them remove the husks. <b>Why</b><b> did Rabbi Zeira say </b>that <b>Rabba bar Yirmeya said </b>that <b>Shmuel said: </b>With regard to the <b>wheat </b>used <b>in the</b><b> meal-offerings, one </b>may <b>not soak it</b><b>?</b> The Gemara answers: The <b>kneading </b>of the dough <b>is </b>performed <b>by diligent</b> priests; however, the act of <b>soaking is not </b>performed <b>by</b><b> diligent </b>priests. Instead, this soaking is performed outside of the Temple confines by less reliable non-priests. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>with regard to <b>kneading, is it</b> performed only <b>by diligent </b>priests? <b>But isn’t it</b><b> written: </b>“And when any one brings a meal-offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour; <b>and he shall pour oil upon it, </b>and place frankincense upon it. <b>And he shall bring it to </b>Aaron’s sons <b>the priests; </b>and he shall take from it his handful of its fine flour, and of its oil, together with all its frankincense” (Leviticus 2:1–2).

            "The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>kneading, although </b>it <b>is not </b>performed <b>by </b><b>diligent </b>priests, <b>it is </b>nevertheless performed <b>in </b>the <b>place of </b>the <b>diligent. </b>Kneading may be carried out by a non-priest, but it must still be performed in the Temple courtyard. <b>As the Master said: Mixing is valid </b>if performed <b>by a non-priest; </b>however, if it is conducted <b>outside </b><b>the walls of the courtyard</b><b>,</b><b> it, </b>the meal offering, <b>is disqualified. </b>This serves <b>to exclude soaking, which is neither</b> performed <b>by </b>the <b>diligent nor </b>performed <b>in </b>the <b>place of</b><b> the diligent. </b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>in <b>what </b>way <b>is </b>this case <b>different from </b>that of <b>the </b><b><i>omer</i></b><b> meal-</b><b>offering</b><b>,</b> which must also be guarded from leavening? <b>As </b><b>it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b><i>omer</i></b><b> offering, one soaks i</b><b>t</b><b> and gathers it, </b>without concern that it will become leavened. The Gemara answers: An act performed by the <b>community is different</b><b>,</b> as the Great Sanhedrin supervises these operations, and those executing them no doubt proceed with great caution. ", 
            "<b>The Sages taught </b>in another <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might </b>have thought that <b>one </b>can <b>fulfill his obligation by </b>eating <i>matza</i> prepared from the wheat of <b>first fruits</b><b>;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “In all of your habitations you shall </b><b>eat </b><b><i>matzot</i></b><b>” </b>(Exodus 12:20).

            "<b>Rabbi Akiva says: </b>That verse is not the source for this <i>halakha</i>; rather, the fact that one cannot fulfill his obligation with <i>matza</i> of first fruits is derived from the juxtaposition of <b><i>matza</i></b><b> and bitter herbs: Just as bitter </b><b>herbs are not first fruits, </b>as they are not included in the seven species to which the mitzva of first fruits applies, <b>so too </b><b><i>matza</i></b> may <b>not be </b>from <b>first </b><b>fruits.

        ],

            "<b>I would </b>then think this comparison <b>excludes wheat and barley, which are from a species </b>that are brought as <b>first fruit</b><b>s</b> and should therefore not be used for the mitzva of <i>matza</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b><b>: “</b><b><i>Matzot</i></b><b>,” “</b><b><i>matzot</i></b><b>” </b>(Deuteronomy 16:3, 8) to <b>amplify </b>and teach that any <i>matza</i> is acceptable for this mitzva. The Gemara asks: <b>If </b>the repetition of <b><i>matzot</i></b> <b><i>matzot</i></b> comes to <b>amplify </b>this <i>halakha</i> that any <i>matza</i> is fit for Passover use, it should <b>also </b>include <i>matza</i> prepared from <b>first-fruit </b>wheat. The Gemara answers: This is indeed true, and <b>Rabbi </b><b>Akiva retracted </b>his statement. He too derives the <i>halakha</i> from the verse: “In all of your habitations.” ", 
            "<b>As it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: I <b>might </b>have thought that <b>a person </b>can <b>fulfill his obligation</b><b> with </b><i>matza</i> from <b>first fruit; </b>therefore <b>the verse states: “</b><b>In all of your habitations you shall eat </b><b><i>matzot</i></b><b>” </b>(Exodus 12:20).

", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see </b>that led you <b>to </b><b>include second-tithe </b>produce due to the words <i>matzot</i> <i>matzot</i> <b>but to exclude first fruits? </b>The Gemara explains: <b>I include </b>the <b>second tithe, which has </b>a means by which it may be <b>permitted </b>to be eaten <b>in all habitations, </b>in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, </b>as will be explained. <b>And I exclude first fruits, which do not have, </b>under any circumstances, a manner by which it is <b>permitted</b> to eat them <b>in all habitations. </b>", 
            "The Gemara explains: <b>As Rabbi Eliezer said: From where </b>is it derived <b>with regard to second-tithe </b>produce <b>that became </b><b>ritually impure</b><b>,</b><b> that one </b>may <b>redeem it even in </b><b>Jerusalem? </b>Second-tithe produce that has been redeemed may be removed from the city. <b>The verse states: </b>“And if the way is too long for you, <b>so that you are</b><b> not able to carry it [</b><b><i>se’eto</i></b><b>], </b>because the place is too far from you, which the Lord your God shall choose to set His name there, when the Lord your God shall bless you” (Deuteronomy 14:24). ", 
            "<b>And </b>it is derived by means of a verbal analogy that this <b>carrying [</b><b><i>se’et</i></b><b>] is nothing other </b>than <b>eating</b><b>,</b><b> as it is stated: “And portions [</b><b><i>masot</i></b><b>] were taken</b><b> to them from before him” </b>(Genesis 43:34). In light of this parallel language, the Gemara understands the phrase “so that you are not able <i>se’eto</i>” to mean: So that you are not able to eat it. Like second-tithe produce that has not yet been taken into Jerusalem, second-tithe produce in the capital that cannot be eaten due to ritual impurity can be redeemed and taken out of the city. Consequently, second tithe can indeed be considered food that may be eaten “in all of your habitations.” ", 
            "The Gemara applies this discussion to the issue at hand: <b>Who did you </b><b>hear that said: </b>One can <b>fulfill his obligation </b>to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with second tithe? </b>It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b><b>Akiva, and </b>yet <b>he excludes first fruits </b>due <b>to </b>the expression: <b>“In all of your habitations.” Learn from this that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>retracted </b>his opinion and accepted Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s derivation. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, </b>why does he learn this <i>halakha</i> from the phrase: “In all of your habitations”? <b>Let</b><b> him derive it from </b>the phrase: <b><i>Leḥem</i></b> <b><i>oni</i></b> (Deuteronomy 16:3). Rabbi Yosei HaGelili derives from this expression that <i>matza</i> must be prepared from produce <b>that </b>can <b>be eaten</b><b> in </b>a state of <b>acute mourning; </b>that <b>excludes this </b>second tithe, <b>which </b>may <b>be eaten only in </b>a state of <b>joy. </b>This exposition should apply to first fruits as well, as they must also be eaten in a state of joy. ", 
            "The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili <b>maintains in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, </b>who says that an acute mourner may eat first fruits. <b>As </b><b>it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>First fruits are prohibited </b><b>to an acute mourner</b><b>,</b><b> and Rabbi Shimon permits </b>an acute mourner to eat first fruits. ", 
            "The Gemara explains this dispute: <b>What is the reason for the Rabbis’ </b>opinion, which maintains that an acute mourner may not eat first fruits? <b>As it is written: “You may not eat</b><b> within your gates </b>the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstlings of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your free-will offerings, nor the offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17). <b>And the Master</b><b> said: “The offering of your hand,” these are first </b><b>fruits, as </b>this verse <b>compares first fruits to </b>the second <b>tithe: Just as </b>the second <b>tithe is prohibited to an </b><b>acute mourner</b><b>,</b> as stated explicitly in the Torah, <b>so </b><b>too </b>are <b>first fruits prohibited to an acute mourner. </b>", 
            "<b>And Rabbi Shimon </b>says in response to this contention: First fruits <b>are called </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b> by the Merciful One </b>and therefore their status is <b>like </b>that of <b><i>teruma</i></b><b>: Just </b><b>as </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b> is permitted to an acute mourner, so too </b><b>first fruits </b>are <b>permitted to an acute mourner. </b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon, although he does not</b> accept this <b>juxtaposition </b>of first fruits and second tithe, <b>in</b><b> any case </b>the word <b>joy is written with regard to</b> first fruits, <b>as it is written: “And you shall rejoice</b><b> in all the good </b>that the Lord has given you and your household” (Deuteronomy 26:11). In light of this, how can Rabbi Shimon permit an acute mourner to eat first fruits? ", 
            "The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon does not learn from <b>that</b> verse that one must eat first fruits while he is personally happy; rather, <b>it comes </b>to teach us <b>that </b>first fruits should be eaten during the <b>period of rejoicing. As</b><b> we learned </b>in a mishna: <b>From </b><b><i>Shevuot</i></b><b> until </b><b><i>Sukkot</i></b><b>, one</b><b> brings </b>first fruits <b>and recites </b>the prayers of thanks to God that appear in the Torah. <b>From </b><b><i>Sukkot</i></b><b> until Hanukkah</b><b> one </b>may <b>bring </b>first fruits, <b>but he does not recite</b> the portion from the Torah. This mishna states that the ideal time for bringing first fruits to the Temple is during the joyous harvest season, from which it may be inferred that this verse is not referring to personal joy of the one bringing the first fruits, but rather to the period of communal joy.

            "<b>The Sages taught </b>that the phrase <b>poor man’s bread [</b><b><i>leḥem</i></b> <b><i>oni</i></b><b>] excludes </b><i>matza</i> that <b>was boiled [</b><b><i>ḥalut</i></b><b>]</b> in hot water after it was baked, which is considered to be a relative delicacy; <b>and </b>this expression also excludes <i>matza</i> that was baked as a <b>large cake [</b><b><i>ashisha</i></b><b>]</b><b>.</b> I <b>might </b>have thought that <b>a person fulfills his obligation </b>to eat <i>matza</i> <b>only </b><b>with coarse [</b><b><i>hadra’a</i></b><b>]</b><b> bread</b><b>;</b> therefore, <b>the verse</b><b> states: “</b><b><i>Matzot</i></b><b>,” “</b><b><i>matzot</i></b><b>,” </b>which serves to <b>amplify </b>and include <i>matza</i> prepared with fine-grade flour. <b>And </b>in fact, one could fulfill his obligation <b>even with </b><b><i>matzot</i></b><b> like those </b><b>of </b>King <b>Solomon, </b>which were prepared from the finest sifted flour. <b>If so, what </b>is the meaning when <b>the </b><b>verse states: “Poor man’s bread”? </b>This phrase comes <b>to exclude boiled </b><i>matza</i> <b>and large cakes</b><b>,</b> but it does not exclude <i>matza</i> prepared from refined flour.

            "<b>Rav Yosef strongly objects to this </b>explanation: <b>If </b>the Sages <b>said </b>that it is permitted to bake bread a handbreadth thick for the shewbread, which was prepared <b>by </b><b>diligent </b>priests who ensured that the dough did not become leavened, will <b>they say </b>the same <b>with regard to </b>other people <b>who are not </b>as <b>diligent? </b>Furthermore, <b>if they said </b>this <b>with regard to well-kneaded bread, </b>will <b>they say </b>the same <b>with regard to bread that is not well </b><b>kneaded? </b>", 
            "Rav Yosef continues: <b>If</b><b> they said </b>that bread a handbreadth thick is permitted in a case where the bread was cooked <b>with dry wood</b><b>, </b>which was brought to the Temple during the dry summer months, as the heat generated from this type of wood would cause the bread to cook quickly before it leavened, will <b>they say </b>the same with regard to ordinary people who cook <b>with moist wood?

            "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben </b><b>Lakish raised a dilemma: What is </b>the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that a person </b>can <b>fulfill his obligation </b>to eat <i>matza</i> <b>with </b><b><i>ḥalla</i></b> separated from <b>second-tithe </b>dough <b>in Jerusalem? </b>The Gemara clarifies this dilemma: <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, do not raise </b>this <b>dilemma. </b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains that one can fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> only with food that may be eaten in a state of acute mourning.

When you raise the dilemma, </b>it is <b>in accordance </b><b>with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. </b>", 
            "The Gemara explains: Unlike Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Akiva does not interpret the phrase “poor man’s bread [<i>leḥem</i> <i>oni</i>]” as though it were written with an <i>alef</i>, which indicates that it is referring to the bread of acute mourning [<i>aninut</i>], i.e., the period of mourning on the day of the death of a close relative. Consequently, the following dilemma arises: It can be suggested that <b>it is with </b>the <b>non-sacred</b> portion of the second-tithe produce <b>that one </b>can <b>fulfill</b> his obligation, <b>for if </b>the produce <b>becomes ritually impure </b>it <b>can be permitted </b>to be eaten <b>in </b>any <b>habitation </b>in Israel after it has been redeemed. Rabbi Akiva agrees that any food that can be eaten in an unrestricted manner in certain circumstances can also be used for the obligation to eat <i>matza</i>. <b>However, </b>with regard to <b><i>ḥalla</i></b><b>, which</b><b>, if becomes ritually impure, cannot be permitted </b>to be eaten <b>in </b>any <b>habitation, but goes, </b>i.e., it is slated <b>for burning, </b>this <i>ḥalla</i> <b>cannot </b>be used to <b>fulfill </b>one’s obligation. ", 
            "<b>Or perhaps we say: Since</b><b>,</b><b> if</b><b> one had not designated </b>the produce as <i>ḥalla</i> <b>and it</b><b> had become ritually impure, </b>it could be redeemed and <b>be</b><b> permitted </b>to be eaten <b>in </b>any <b>habitation, </b>and one could <b>fulfill </b>the obligation of <i>matza</i> <b>with it, now too,</b> one can <b>fulfill </b>his obligation <b>with it, </b>despite the fact that it has been designated as <i>ḥalla</i>. Since the sanctity is not inherent in the dough itself, it does not undermine its status as fit for <i>matza</i>. ", 
            "<b>Some say </b>a different version of this analysis: With regard to <b>this </b>case, <b>certainly do not raise the dilemma, as </b>here <b>we certainly </b>apply the principle of: <b>Since, </b>as stated above.

Rather, <b>when you raise the dilemma, </b>it is with regard to <b><i>ḥalla</i></b><b> that was purchased with</b><b> second-tithe money, </b>as this type of food can be ritually purified if it becomes ritually impure. ", 
            "<b>And </b>furthermore, <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, do not raise </b>this <b>dilemma, since they say</b><b> that </b>it <b>can be redeemed </b>for a second time; <b>this</b> case <b>is </b>identical to the case of second-<b>tithe </b>produce itself. In this regard, the Rabbis do not distinguish between the money with which the second tithe was redeemed and the second-tithe produce itself. <b>Rather, when you raise the</b><b> dilemma, </b>it is <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said </b>that an object that was purchased with second-tithe money and that became ritually impure must <b>be buried. </b>", 
            "<b>As we learned </b>in a mishna with regard to food <b>that was purchased with second-tithe </b><b>money that became ritually impure</b><b>,</b> this ritually impure food should <b>be redeemed </b>for money, with which one must purchase other food. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: </b>It should <b>be buried. </b>Since this food was merely purchased with second-tithe money, it does not have the same degree of sanctity as the tithe itself. Therefore, its status as a second-tithe object cannot be transferred to yet a third object. Consequently, if it becomes impure, it cannot be redeemed for money but must be buried as an item for which there is no use. ", 
            "The Gemara clarifies the aforementioned dilemma: <b>Do </b><b>we say </b>the following: <b>Since, if it were not purchased </b>with second-tithe money, <b>and </b>furthermore, <b>since, if one had </b><b>not designated it </b>as <i>ḥalla</i> <b>and it became ritually impure, </b>this produce would be <b>permitted </b>to be eaten <b>in </b>any <b>habitation, </b>one can therefore <b>fulfill </b>his obligation <b>with it </b>even after its status has changed by being purchased with second-tithe money and designated as <i>ḥalla</i>? ", 
            "<b>Or perhaps we say </b><b>one </b>of these logical arguments starting with: <b>Since, but we </b><b>do not say two </b>arguments of: <b>Since. </b>If so, one cannot fulfill his obligation with <i>matza</i> of <i>ḥalla</i> separated from second tithe. <b>Rava said: It stands to reason </b>that <b>the </b><b>category of tithe is a single </b>designation. In other words, provided that the food is included in the general framework of second tithe, it can be used for <i>matza</i>, and this applies even to the <i>ḥalla</i> separated from second tithe. ", 
            "We learned in the mishna that if one prepared the <b>loaves </b><b>of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers </b>for himself, he cannot use them to fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> on Passover.

            "The Gemara asks another question: <b>And let him derive </b>this <i>halakha</i>, that one cannot fulfill his obligation to eat <i>matza</i> with the loaves of a thanks-offering or a nazirite’s wafers, from the fact <b>that it is </b><b><i>matza</i></b> <b><i>ashira</i></b><b>, </b>enhanced <i>matza</i>, as both the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers contain oil. <i>Matza</i> that contains ingredients besides flour and water is classified as <i>matza</i> <i>ashira</i> and cannot be used for the mitzva of eating <i>matza</i> on the first night of Passover.

            "<b>Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: </b>This is an incorrect definition, as the total amount of oil in these loaves or wafers <b>is </b>only <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i>, <b>and </b>as this small amount of oil <b>is divided between several loaves, </b>it is nullified in the mixture.

These offerings are not among those that can be sacrificed only: “In the place that the Lord shall choose” (Deuteronomy 12:5). This means that during that period the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s wafers could indeed have been eaten anywhere, as improvised altars were built in any place.

            "The Gemara rejects this: <b>And from where </b>do we know that this conclusion is correct? <b>Perhaps it is different </b><b>there, as at the time when guarding is required, </b>i.e., when water was added to the flour, <b>he did</b><b> not perform </b>his duty to <b>guard it </b>properly. <b>However, </b>in a case <b>where at the time when guarding is required</b><b>, </b>when water is added the flour, <b>he </b>properly <b>performed </b>his duty to <b>guard it, so too, </b>it is possible that <b>guarding </b>flour at the time <b>of kneading is </b>considered proper <b>guarding. </b>Therefore, this question cannot be resolved based on the case of dough prepared by gentiles.

            "<b>And although </b>this proof was rejected, <b>Rava did</b><b> not retract </b>his statement that guarding grain must begin before kneading. <b>For he </b>would <b>say to those who cut </b>and tied <b>the stalks [</b><b><i>kifei</i></b><b>]</b> of grain in the field: <b>When you cut </b>the grain, <b>cut it for the purpose</b><b> of the mitzva.

", 
            "<b>He said to him: I did not hear </b>about this statement; <b>that is to say, I do not hold </b>in accordance with it. I do not distinguish between these two cases, as in my opinion the Rabbis permit one to eat even this <i>ḥaroset</i>.", 
            "<b>Rav Ashi</b><b> said: It is reasonable </b>to rule <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana, from </b>the fact <b>that Shmuel said</b> that <b>the </b><b><i>halakha</i></b><b> is not in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, </b>who maintains that vinegar will prevent grain from becoming leavened. <b>What, isn’t it </b>correct to infer from here that vinegar added to flour <b>does not shrink</b> the grain and will <b>even leaven </b>it? According to this explanation, food that contains vinegar, e.g., <i>ḥaroset</i>, is likely to be leavened immediately, as claimed by Rav Kahana. ", 
            "The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No, </b>this is no proof, as <b>perhaps </b>Shmuel meant that, according to the opinion of the Rabbis, vinegar will <b>neither cause </b>the wheat <b>to shrink nor leaven </b>it.

            "The mishna taught that <b>one </b>may <b>not boil </b>the Paschal lamb in liquid. To explain this issue, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the verse: “You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way in water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs, and with the innards in it” (Exodus 12:9). <b>The Sages taught: “</b><b>In water”; I have </b>derived <b>nothing other </b>than the prohibition against boiling the Paschal lamb <b>in water.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is </b>the practical difference <b>between </b>these two derivations?

According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, it is prohibited to prepare the Paschal lamb in this manner, as this is considered boiling, whereas the Rabbis maintain that an action is classified as boiling only if one adds liquid to the meat.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, </b>with regard to <b>that </b>phrase, <b>“boiled in any way,” what do they </b><b>do with it? </b>The Gemara answers: It is <b>required for </b><b>that which was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one boiled </b>the Paschal lamb <b>and afterward roasted it, or roasted it </b><b>and afterward boiled it</b><b>,</b><b> he is liable </b>to receive lashes for boiling the Paschal lamb.

            "<b>And now, </b>after the destruction of the Temple, <b>Edomite wine </b><b>does not turn to vinegar unless one places barley into </b><b>it.

The Sages expound: <b>If this one, </b>Jerusalem, <b>is</b><b> full, </b>then <b>that one, </b>her enemy, <b>is laid waste; </b><b>and if this </b>enemy <b>is full, </b>then <b>she, </b>Jerusalem, <b>is</b><b> laid waste. </b>Therefore, when the Jewish people fall, their enemies can achieve the success that was once attained by the Jews. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </b>This notion can be derived <b>from here, </b>where the verse states regarding Esau and Jacob: <b>“The one people shall be stronger than the </b><b>other people” </b>(Genesis 25:23), meaning that when one nation gains power, the other is weakened, because they cannot both be strong at the same time.

After filtering the wine from the stems, seeds, and skins, water was poured over these remnants. The liquid was then drained off and allowed to ferment until it became vinegar. This liquid was called <i>temed</i>, and it is not necessary to tithe it. Vinegar was produced in this way because the wine of that time was so strong that it did not turn to vinegar on its own. <b>But now, one</b><b> who purchases vinegar from an </b><b><i>am</i></b> <b><i>ha’aretz</i></b><b> must tithe</b><b> it, </b>as the wine nowadays turns to vinegar quickly, <b>and</b><b> the presumption is </b>that vinegar <b>comes only from wine. </b>",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, </b>if the phrase: Anything leavened, is referring to food that became leavened by means of something else, then when this same phrase appears with regard <b>to </b>the <b>prohibition, </b>I should explain that it <b>comes for</b><b> that </b>purpose <b>as well. </b>Consequently, there should be no violation for eating a mixture that contains leaven, as apparently, the phrase: Anything leavened, does not refer to that case at all.",

Only when no other derivation is possible is a less related matter derived. ", 
            "The Gemara explains: <b>And the Rabbis, who are not of </b>the opinion that leaven in a <b>mixture </b>is included in the prohibition, <b>do not interpret </b>that the term: <b>Anything [</b><b><i>kol </i></b><b>], </b>comes to include other matters; neither with regard to leaven in a mixture nor with regard to <i>karet</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>However, </b>in that case, <b>from where do they </b>derive that it is prohibited for <b>women </b>to eat leavened bread? ", 
            "The Gemara answers: Although <b>they</b><b> do not derive </b>a <i>halakha</i> from the term: <b>Anything, they</b><b> derive </b>a <i>halakha</i> from the expression: <b>For anyone [</b><b><i>ki</i></b> <b><i>kol</i></b><b>], </b>in the verse: “For anyone who eats leaven.”", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>if indeed the phrase: For anyone, is a more inclusive expression than the simple word anything, then according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer, </b>another <i>halakha</i> could also be derived from here. <b>Say </b>that the phrase: <b>Anyone </b>who eats leaven, comes <b>to</b><b> include the women, </b>and the phrase: <b>For anyone </b>who eats, comes <b>to include </b>leaven in <b>its mixture. </b>According to Rabbi Eliezer, then, one would be punishable by <i>karet</i> for eating leaven in a mixture.

            "<b>And lest you say that Rabbi Eliezer does not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the phrase: <b>For anyone [</b><b><i>ki</i></b> <b><i>kol</i></b><b>], </b>as he does not consider this an inclusive expression, the result would be another contradiction. <b>Wasn’t </b>it <b>taught </b>in another <i>baraita</i>: “For no [<i>ki</i> <i>kol</i>] leaven nor any honey shall be offered as a burnt-offering before God” (Leviticus 2:11)?

            "The Gemara concludes: This matter remains <b>difficult</b><b>, </b>as no satisfactory explanation has been found for why Rabbi Eliezer does not derive from the expression <i>ki</i> <i>kol</i> that leaven in a mixture is also prohibited.", 
            "After discussing leaven in a mixture, the Gemara states a more general principle. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said </b>that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b><b> said: With regard to all prohibitions of the Torah, a</b><b> permitted </b>substance <b>does not join together with a prohibited </b>substance. If one eats a permitted food with a prohibited food, and together they constitute the minimum prohibited measure, he is exempt from punishment for this act of consumption. This principle applies to all <i>halakhot</i> <b>except for the prohibitions of a</b><b> nazirite, </b>who is liable for eating a mixture of that kind, <b>as the Torah said </b>with regard to a nazirite: “He shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink anything <b>soaked </b>in grapes” (Numbers 6:3). This verse indicates that a nazirite is prohibited from consuming not only wine and vinegar, but also any food that was soaked in these liquids. ", 
            "<b>And Ze’eiri said: </b>Permitted and prohibited substances <b>also </b>combine with regard to <b>the prohibition against</b><b> offering leaven </b>on the altar, as it states: “For no [<i>kol </i>] leaven and no [<i>kol </i>] honey shall be offered as a burnt-offering before the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11). This indicates that one is also liable for sacrificing leaven in a mixture (<i>Tosafot</i>) in addition to the liability for sacrificing pure leaven. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose </b>opinion did Ze’eiri issue his ruling? It is <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who derives </b>from the term <b><i>kol</i></b> that any mixture that contains any amount of a prohibited substance is not nullified.",

        [
            "with regard <b>to the matter of leavened bread</b><b> on Passover </b>one should <b>also </b>be liable for eating a prohibited substance joined together with a permitted substance. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, indeed it </b><b>is so, and </b>the prohibition mentioned by Ze’eiri against sacrificing leaven in offerings was only <b>to exclude </b>the statement <b>of Abaye, who said: There is </b>significance to <b>offering less </b><b>than an olive-bulk </b>of leaven on the altar, and one is flogged for sacrificing an offering of that kind. By noting that one is liable because permitted substances combine with prohibited substances, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that an </b><b>offering </b>of <b>less than an olive-bulk </b>is <b>not </b>considered an offering, and therefore sacrificing it is not punishable by lashes.

            "Abaye continues. <b>And we discussed this </b>issue: <b>Why </b>are the ingredients in the <b>place that he touched disqualified? </b>The <b>spices, </b>i.e., the garlic or oil, <b>are </b><b>nullified by the majority. </b>Since the major portion of the dish is composed of non-sacred produce, it should not be disqualified by contact with one who immersed himself during that day. <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </b>in reply: <b>What is the reason </b>that it becomes disqualified?

The Rabbis maintain that one is not punished by Torah law for eating a mixture containing leaven. Although the Rabbis do not derive from the word: Anything [<i>kol </i>], that leaven in a mixture is prohibited, they should nonetheless hold one liable for eating an olive-bulk of a prohibited substance in the time it takes to eat a half-loaf of bread. ", 
            "Rav Dimi said: <b>Rather, what </b>conclusion must be drawn; the reason that a non-priest is flogged for eating the <i>teruma</i> soup is <b>due to </b>the fact that <b>a permitted </b>substance <b>joins together with a prohibited </b>substance? If so, <b>ultimately,</b><b> why do the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer with regard</b><b> to </b>eating <b>Babylonian </b><b><i>kutaḥ</i></b><b>?

            "Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Dimi from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>two pots</b><b>, one of non-sacred </b>produce <b>and </b>the other <b>one of</b> <b><i>teruma</i></b><b>, before which </b>were <b>two mortars, </b>one in <b>which non</b><b>-sacred </b>produce was pounded, <b>and one </b>in <b>which </b><b><i>teruma</i></b> produce was pounded, <b>and </b>the contents of <b>these </b>mortars <b>fell </b><b>into these </b>pots, but it is unknown which produce fell into which pot, <b>it is </b>all <b>permitted. </b>The reason for this ruling is <b>as I say, </b>since there is no definitive proof to the contrary, that the <b><i>teruma</i></b><b> fell into </b><b>the </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b> and </b>the <b>non-sacred produce fell into </b>the <b>non-sacred produce. </b>", 
            "Abaye explains his objection: <b>And if you say </b>that eating <b>an olive-bulk </b>of a prohibited substance <b>in the time it takes to eat </b><b>a half-loaf </b>of bread is prohibited <b>by Torah </b>law, <b>why do we say </b>this principle: <b>As I sa</b><b>y</b> <b>that </b>the <b><i>teruma</i></b> fell <b>into </b>the <i>teruma</i>, <b>etc.? </b>If the <i>teruma</i> produce fell into the pot containing non-sacred produce, one who eats from the mixture will consume an olive-bulk of <i>teruma</i> within the time it takes to eat a half-loaf of bread, and he will thereby violate a Torah prohibition. Rav Dimi <b>said to him: Leave </b><b><i>teruma</i></b> separated from <b>spices, </b>which is <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic </b>law. By Torah law one is required to separate <i>teruma</i> only from grain, wine and oil. The Sages are lenient with regard to <i>teruma</i> by rabbinic law. ", 
            "Abaye <b>raised </b>another <b>objection </b>from a similar <i>baraita</i>: In a case where there are <b>two baskets, one </b>filled with <b>non-sacred </b>produce <b>and the other </b>filled with <b><i>teruma</i></b><b>, and before them </b>were <b>two </b>vessels each containing a <b><i>se’a</i></b> of produce, <b>one </b>filled with <b>non-sacred </b>produce <b>and </b>the other <b>one </b>filled <b>with </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b>, and these, </b>the contents of each of the baskets, <b>fell into those, </b>each of the <i>se’a</i> vessels.

            "The Gemara returns to its discussion of Rabbi Abbahu’s statement with regard to the meaning of the word soaked in the verse: “He shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink anything soaked in grapes,” and whether or not a permitted substance combines with a prohibited one. The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>does <b>this </b>word: <b>Soaked, come to </b>teach <b>that </b>mixtures are prohibited in this case?

            "<b>From here you derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to the entire Torah; </b>in all cases, the legal status of the taste of a forbidden food is like that of its substance.

Therefore, based on the same <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i> inference, the principle: The legal status of its taste is like that of its substance, should apply in this case as well. Similarly, all other prohibitions in the Torah are more severe than the case of a nazirite in one of these aspects, and therefore this principle is universal. In any case, this entire derivation presents a difficulty for Rabbi Yoḥanan, who derives a different <i>halakha</i> from the term: Soaked. ",

In the case of prohibited mixtures of <b>diverse kinds too, this </b>element <b>alone and that </b>element <b>alone </b>are each <b>permitted, and </b>yet <b>together they are prohibited. </b>", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, </b>the novelty is <b>that if one soaks </b>meat <b>in </b><b>milk all day, it is permitted </b>by Torah law, despite the fact that the meat certainly absorbed some taste of the milk, whereas if <b>one cooked </b>the meat in milk even for a short time, the mixture <b>is prohibited </b>by Torah law. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva too </b>certainly agrees that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>meat in milk is a novelty. </b>How can he derive a general principle from this case? ", 
            "<b>Rather, he </b><b>derives </b>the principle: The legal status of the taste is like that of the substance itself <b>from </b>the required <b>purging </b>of the vessels of <b>gentiles. </b>In the section of the Torah that deals with the spoils of Midian (Numbers 31:21–24), it states that a vessel used by a gentile to cook food must be purged through fire and purified before it may be used by a Jew. <b>Isn’t </b>the <b>purging </b>of vessels of <b>gentiles </b>necessary only to cleanse them from the <b>mere taste </b>that was absorbed through the process of cooking? Even so, these vessels are <b>prohibited </b>if this cleansing was not performed. <b>Here, too, </b>it is <b>no </b><b>different; </b>the same reasoning applies in all cases. ", 
            "The Gemara comments: <b>And the</b><b> Rabbis </b>do not derive this principle from this source, as they maintain that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>purging </b>vessels of <b>gentiles</b><b> is </b>also <b>a novelty. </b>What is the novelty of this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As </b>in general, <b>anything that contributes taste </b>that renders the food <b>tainte</b><b>d</b><b> is permitted. </b>If the taste added by the prohibited food does not enhance the permitted food, then as a rule it does not render the permitted substance prohibited. <b>As we derive </b>this principle <b>from </b>the <i>halakha</i> that <b>an </b>unslaughtered <b>animal carcass </b>that is unfit for consumption is not classified as a prohibited animal carcass and is not prohibited. <b>However, here, </b>with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of purging vessels of gentiles, the Torah states that even if they contribute taste that renders the food tainted they are <b>prohibited. </b>If twenty-four hours have passed since food was cooked in a pot, the assumption is that it will contribute a negative taste to any foods cooked in the pot subsequently. Nevertheless, vessels taken from gentiles remain prohibited until they are purged, even though the taste they contribute taints the food. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>how does <b>Rabbi Akiva, </b>who derives this principle from the required purging of the vessels of gentiles, respond to the previous claim? The Gemara explains: He holds <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion subsequently cited in the name of <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, who</b><b> said: The Torah prohibited </b>unpurged vessels of gentiles <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a pot </b>that was used <b>on that</b><b> day. Therefore, it is not </b>a case where the pot <b>contributes taste </b>that renders the food <b>tainted. </b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>what do <b>the Rabbis</b> say about deriving the <i>halakha</i> from a pot used on that day? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, <b>even </b>in the case of <b>a pot </b>used <b>on that day, it</b><b> is impossible that </b>the vessel <b>does not slightly taint </b>the food absorbed in the vessel. Consequently, the <i>halakha</i> of purging vessels of gentiles is indeed a novel case from which principles cannot be derived. ", 
            "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav</b><b> Ashi: From </b>the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, let us </b><b>learn </b>the correct interpretation of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b><b> Don’t the Rabbis say </b>that the term <b>soaked teaches</b> that the principle that the legal status of <b>taste is</b><b> like </b>that of <b>substance </b>applies not only to a nazirite, but that <b>from here you derive </b>the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all prohibitions of the Torah?

            "<b>due to </b>the fact that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a nazirite </b>and those of <b>a sin-offering</b> are <b>two verses that come as one</b><b>,</b> i.e., to teach the same principle, and two verses that teach the same principle <b>do not teach </b>that principle by analogy. ", 
            "The Gemara elaborates: The derivation that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance in the case of <b>a</b><b> nazirite </b>is <b>that which we stated </b>above. With regard to <b>a sin-offering, what is </b>the derivation that permitted material combines with prohibited material? <b>As it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Anything that </b><b>touches in its flesh shall become consecrated” </b>(Leviticus 6:20). I <b>might </b>have thought that non-sacred meat that touched any part of a sin-offering is rendered prohibited <b>even if</b><b> it did not absorb </b>the taste of the sin-offering it touched. Therefore, <b>the verse states: In its flesh </b><b>shall become consecrated, </b>to teach that this meat is not consecrated <b>until </b>the taste of the sin-offering <b>is absorbed</b><b> within its flesh</b><b>.</b> ", 
            "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Shall become consecrated </b>means that <b>its </b>legal status <b>becomes like </b>that of the sin-offering itself; <b>that </b>is, <b>if </b>the sin-offering <b>is disqualified, </b>this meat <b>will </b>also <b>be disqualified. And if </b>the sin-offering <b>is valid, </b>the meat that touched it may <b>be eaten in accordance with </b><b>the more stringent </b>standards <b>of </b>a sin-offering as far as when and where it may be eaten. The principle that a permitted substance joins together with a prohibited substance applies in the case of a sin-offering as well. Therefore, the principle cannot be extended to the entire Torah, as a <i>halakha</i> stated in two cases is not applied elsewhere. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>according to <b>the</b><b> Rabbis as well, let </b>the cases of <b>a nazirite and</b><b> a sin-offering </b>be considered <b>two verses that come as</b><b> one and they do not teach </b>the principle that the legal status of taste is like that of the substance with regard to the entire Torah.",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva, </b>who does not derive a general principle from these verses, would respond by asking: In <b>what </b>way <b>are </b>they <b>necessary?</b><b> Granted, if the Merciful One had written </b>this principle only with regard <b>to a sin-offering, </b>one would <b>not derive </b>the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a nazirite from it, </b>as <b>we do not</b><b> derive </b><i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred </b>objects <b>from </b>those of <b>consecrated</b> objects.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, </b>as they maintain that the principle that the legal status of the taste of a prohibited substance is like that of the substance itself is not limited to these two cases, they would <b>say to you </b>that both sources <b>are </b><b>necessary. </b>The case of the <b>sin-offering </b>is necessary <b>to</b> derive the principle <b>that a permitted </b>substance <b>joins together with</b><b> a prohibited </b>substance, as <b>one cannot derive </b>the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>non-sacred </b>food <b>from consecrated </b>property. <b>And </b>the term <b>soaked, </b>which appears in the context of the <i>halakhot</i> of a nazirite, <b>teaches </b>the principle that the legal status of <b>taste is like </b>that of the <b>substance. </b>Since both examples are necessary, they are not considered two verses that come as one, and it is therefore possible to derive a principle from them. <b>And </b>consequently, <b>from here you derive </b>the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to all of the Torah in its </b><b>entirety. </b>",

This contradicts the mishna, which states that one who is going to a betrothal feast may nullify the leaven without returning for it, because the meal is considered a mitzva. ", 
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </b>This is <b>not difficult, </b>as there is a tannaitic dispute with regard to the issue. <b>This </b>source, the <i>baraita</i>, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, </b>while <b>that </b>source, the mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b><b>Yosei.

            "<b>And</b><b> now that Rav Ḥisda said: The dispute </b>between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei applies to <b>the second </b>betrothal feast, where the groom takes part in an additional meal with the bride’s family, <b>but everyone agrees that the first </b>betrothal <b>feast is a mitzva, </b>the contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> can be resolved differently. <b>Even if you </b><b>say that this </b>mishna and <b>that </b><i>baraita</i> are both in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, </b>it is <b>not</b><b> difficult.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What is </b>meant by <b>this </b>statement that their union will be inauspicious? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: </b>The inauspicious nature of such a marriage can be identified based on the verse describing the return of a daughter of a priest to her father’s house after marrying a non-priest.

            "The Gemara shifts to a discussion of an ignoramus who has some degree of sensitivity (<i>Me’iri</i>). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Anyone who engages in Torah </b>study <b>in</b><b> the presence of an ignoramus, </b>causing the ignoramus embarrassment and anguish over his inability to study Torah, <b>is considered as</b><b> though he had sexual relations with </b>the ignoramus’s <b>betrothed</b> bride <b>in his presence, as it is stated: “Moses</b><b> commanded us the Torah, an inheritance </b>[<b><i>morasha</i></b>] for the congregation of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:4). <b>Do not read it </b>as <b>inheritance [</b><b><i>morasha</i></b><b>]; rather, </b>read it as <b>betrothed [</b><b><i>me’orasa</i></b><b>]. </b>The Torah is compared to the betrothed bride of the Jewish people until one studies it and thereby consummates his marriage with it.

            "The Gemara returns to explaining the mishna. It was taught: <b>And so too, </b><b>one who left </b>Jerusalem with sacrificial meat in his possession must return to Jerusalem to burn it, just as one is required to return in order to remove leaven from his possession. According to Rabbi Meir, this <i>halakha</i> applies with regard to an egg-bulk of sacrificial meat or leaven, whereas Rabbi Yehuda disagrees and says the minimum amount for both is an olive-bulk. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to </b><b>say that Rabbi Meir holds </b>that <b>an egg-bulk is </b>the minimal amount that is considered <b>significant, and Rabbi Yehuda </b><b>holds that an olive-bulk is also </b>considered <b>significant? </b>The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction </b>from a mishna in <i>Berakhot</i>: <b>How</b><b> much </b>food must one eat in order <b>to obligate </b>those with whom he ate <b>in a </b><b><i>zimmun</i></b><b>? An olive-bulk</b> of food is sufficient according to the unattributed opinion in the mishna, which is generally that of Rabbi Meir. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda says: An egg-bulk </b>is the minimum measure to obligate those with whom one ate in a <i>zimmun</i>. This seems to contradict the opinions of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda stated in the mishna here. ", 
            "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </b><b>The opinions are reversed </b>in one of these sources, and must be emended. ",

            "However, <b>here, </b>in the cases of leaven and consecrated food, <b>they</b><b> disagree </b>not with regard to the interpretation of verses but <b>with regard to logical reasoning, as Rabbi Meir holds: </b>The requirement to <b>return </b>consecrated food <b>is analogous to its ritual</b><b> impurity.

            "Another opinion on this issue <b>was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Natan says: </b>The minimum measure for both <b>this and that, </b>leaven and sacrificial meat, is <b>two egg-bulks </b>of prohibited material, <b>but </b><b>the Rabbis did not agree with him.</b>", 
            "Incidental to the discussion of leaving Jerusalem and its surrounding area, the Gemara cites expositions of a prophetic passage, including a statement that God will eventually expand the boundaries of Jerusalem.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why </b>discuss this prohibition <b>particularly </b>with regard to <b>Passover </b><b>eves</b><b>?</b> <b>It </b>is prohibited to perform labor <b>even </b>on <b>Shabbat </b><b>eve</b><b>s</b> <b>and Festival eves as well, as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who performs labor on Shabbat eves and</b><b> Festival eves from </b><b><i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward never sees a</b><b> sign of blessing </b>from this work.

            "The Gemara cites the source of the <b>matter </b><b>itself </b>in its entirety: <b>One who performs labor on Shabbat</b><b> eves or on Festival eves from </b><b><i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward</b><b>, </b>and similarly one who works immediately upon <b>the conclusion of</b><b> Shabbat</b><b>,</b> or <b>the conclusion of a Festival</b><b>,</b> or <b>the conclusion of Yom Kippur, or on any occasion where</b><b> there is a trace of sin, </b>which comes <b>to include</b><b> a communal fast</b><b>,</b> e.g., the Ninth of Av or a fast for rain, when it is prohibited to perform labor, <b>never sees a sign of blessin</b><b>g</b> from this work. If one performs labor just before Shabbat or immediately after Shabbat, the concern is that even a slight miscalculation could lead to performance of labor on Shabbat itself, when it is prohibited.

            "Apropos reward or lack thereof, the Gemara cites th<i>e Tosefta</i> in which <b>the Sages taught: There </b><b>is </b>one who is <b>diligent and rewarded </b>for his diligence; <b>and there is </b>one who is <b>diligent and penalized </b>due to his diligence; <b>there is </b>one who is <b>lazy and </b><b>rewarded; and there is </b>one who is <b>lazy and penalized. </b>How so? <b>Diligent and rewarded </b>is referring to one <b>who </b><b>works the entire week and does not work on Shabbat </b><b>eve.

            "On the topic of reward for a mitzva fulfilled without intent, <b>Rava raised a contradiction: </b>It <b>is written: “For Your mercy is great unto the heavens,</b> and Your truth reaches the skies” (Psalms 57:11); <b>and it</b><b> is written </b>elsewhere: <b>“For Your mercy is great above </b><b>the heavens, </b>and Your truth reaches the skies” (Psalms 108:5). <b>How so? </b>How can these verses be reconciled?

            "<b>The Sages taught: One who anticipates</b> receiving <b>the earnings of his wife or </b>of <b>a mill</b><b> never sees a sign of blessing </b>from them. The Gemara explains: <b>Earnings of his wife </b>is referring to a case where she spins thread for others and charges by weight on <b>a scal</b><b>e</b> (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). The profit is small and it is demeaning to walk in public to solicit customers. Earnings of the <b>mill </b>is referring to a hand mill for which people pay <b>rent </b>and grind their grain. In that case too, the profits are meager. <b>However, if</b><b> a woman works and sells </b>the product of her labor, <b>the verse praises her, as it is written </b>about a woman of valor: <b>“She made a cloak and sold </b><b>it, </b>and delivered a belt to the peddler” (Proverbs 31:24).

            "<b>The Sages taught </b>with regard to a sign of blessing: <b>One who earns </b>a living <b>from </b>selling <b>rods or jugs will never see a sign</b><b> of blessing </b>from them. <b>What is the reason </b>for this? <b>Since their volume </b>is great, <b>the </b>evil <b>eye dominates</b><b> them. </b>People believe that one is selling more than he is actually selling. Similarly, <b>the Sages taught: Merchants </b>who sell their wares <b>in an alleyway [</b><b><i>simta</i></b><b>]</b> adjacent to a thoroughfare, where they are seen by all; <b>and those who</b><b> raise small livestock, </b>which tend to damage other people’s fields; <b>and those who chop down good </b>fruit <b>trees, </b>even if they were permitted to do so; and <b>those who direct</b><b> their eyes to the fine portion </b>with the intention of taking that portion for himself when dividing an item with others, will <b>never see a sign of blessing </b>from them. <b>What is the reason </b>for this? It is <b>that </b>due to these actions <b>people wonder about him </b>and pay special attention to his conduct. Due to that attention, his actions will not be blessed. ", 
            "Similarly <b>the </b><b>Sages taught: In four </b><b><i>perutot</i></b><b>, </b>payments, <b>there is never a </b><b>sign of blessing: Wages of scribes </b>of sacred books; <b>wages </b><b>of disseminators, </b>who repeat and explain the lectures delivered by the Sages on Shabbat; <b>payment of orphans, </b>which one receives when engaging in a partnership with the executor of an orphan’s estate; <b>and money that comes from a country </b><b>overseas. </b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, </b>one will be unsuccessful when receiving <b>wages of disseminators, as it appears as </b>if he is receiving <b>wages </b>for work performed on <b>Shabbat, </b>even though what he is doing is not actually prohibited. <b>And</b> it is also understandable that one will see no blessing from <b>orphans’ money, </b>as minors <b>are not capable of </b><b>relinquishing </b>property. Minors do not have the legal right to forgive even negligible losses, which partners typically overlook. Therefore, one who in the course of business takes even the smallest amount of money from them beyond the sum to which he is entitled is considered a thief. One sees no blessing from <b>money that comes from a country overseas, </b>because <b>a miracle does not transpire every day. </b>Since the risks involved in shipping cargo on long sea voyages are great, one’s merit is diminished each time his merchandise miraculously arrives intact. ", 
            "However, <b>what is </b><b>the reason </b>that one sees no blessing from <b>wages of </b><b>scribes? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The members of the</b><b> Great Assembly observed twenty-four fasts, </b>corresponding to the twenty-four priestly watches (Maharsha), <b>for scribes </b>who write Torah <b>scrolls</b><b>, phylacteries, and </b><b><i>mezuzot</i></b><b>, so that they will not become wealthy</b> from their craft, <b>as were they </b>to <b>become wealthy, they</b> would no longer <b>write </b>these sacred items. Similarly, <b>the Sages</b><b> taught: Scribes </b>who write <b>scrolls, phylacteries, and </b><b><i>mezuzot</i></b><b>; </b>and <b>their</b><b> merchants, </b>who buy the sacred scrolls from the scribes to sell them; and <b>their merchants’ merchants; and all those engaged</b><b> in the work of Heaven </b>and earn their living from it, a phrase that comes <b>to include those who sell</b><b> the sky-blue </b>dye for ritual fringes, <b>never see a</b><b> sign of blessing </b>from their labor. <b>And if they </b><b>engage </b>in these activities <b>for their own sake, </b>to ensure that there will be more sacred items available to the public, then <b>they </b>do <b>see </b>blessing from their labor.", 
            "As the mishna discusses the requirement to observe local customs, the Gemara relates: <b>The residents of Beit She’an were accustomed not </b><b>to travel from Tyre to </b>market day in <b>Sido</b><b>n</b><b> on</b><b> Shabbat eve. </b>In deference to Shabbat, they adopted a stringency and would not interrupt their Shabbat preparations even for a short sea voyage. <b>Their children came before Rabbi Yoḥanan </b>to request that he repeal this custom. <b>They said to him</b><b>: </b>Due to their wealth, it was possible for <b>our fathers</b> to earn a living without traveling to the market on Friday; <b>however, it is not possible for u</b><b>s</b> to do so. <b>He said to them: Your fathers already accepted </b>this virtuous custom <b>upon themselves</b><b>,</b> and it remains in effect for you, <b>as it is stated: “My son, hear </b><b>your father’s rebuke and do not abandon your mother’</b><b>s teaching” </b>(Proverbs 1:8). In addition to adhering to one’s father’s rebuke, i.e., <i>halakha</i>, one is also required to preserve his mother’s teaching, i.e., ancestral customs. ", 
            "The Gemara relates additional customs: <b>The residents </b>of the city of <b>Ḥoza</b><b>i</b><b> were accustomed to separate </b><b><i>ḥalla</i></b><b> from rice </b>dough. <b>They came and told Rav Yosef </b>about this custom. <b>He</b><b> said to them: Let a non-priest eat </b>this dough <b>in their presence </b>to show them unequivocally that this custom has no legal basis. <b>Abaye raised an objection to him</b><b>: </b>With regard to <b>matters </b>that are <b>permitted, but others </b><b>were accustomed to </b>treat <b>them </b>as a <b>prohibition</b><b>,</b> "
        ], 
        [
            "<b>you are not allowed to permit </b>these actions in their presence, lest they come to treat other prohibitions lightly, saying: If this previously prohibited activity was permitted, other prohibitions are not particularly stringent either. How did Rav Yosef permit the residents of Ḥozai to eat rice dough? Rav Yosef <b>said to </b>Abaye: <b>And wasn’t it stated </b>about this <i>halakha</i> concerning stringencies that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: </b>This was stated specifically <b>with regard to Samaritans</b><b>?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>What is the reason </b>that this applies to <b>Samaritans? </b>It is due to the fact that <b>they will extend </b>this <b>matter </b>of leniency, and add to it additional, unjustified leniencies. <b>These people </b>of Ḥozai <b>will also extend </b>this <b>matter </b>of leniency, and come to practice additional leniencies in other cases, as they are ignoramuses.

            "<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: We see, if the majority</b> of people in that place <b>eat rice, </b>do <b>not let</b><b> a non-priest eat </b><i>ḥalla</i> <b>in their presence, lest the</b> halakhic <b>category </b>of <b><i>ḥalla</i></b><b> be forgotten from them.

            "After mentioning <i>halakhot</i> relating to customs, the Gemara returns to discuss the <b>matter itself. </b>If <b>matters </b>are <b>permitte</b><b>d</b><b> but others</b><b> were accustomed to </b>treat <b>them </b>as a <b>prohibition, you are</b><b> not allowed to permit </b>these actions in their presence. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: We are dealing with Samaritans, </b>not with Jews. The Gemara is surprised at this: <b>And doesn’t </b>this apply <b>to everyone? Wasn’t it taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> to the contrary? <b>Two brothers may bathe together</b><b>,</b> and there is no concern that doing so is immodest or will lead to sinful thoughts. <b>However, </b>the custom was that <b>two brothers do not bathe together in </b>the city of <b>Kabul </b>(see I Kings 9:13). <b>And </b>there was <b>an incident involving Yehuda and Hillel</b><b>,</b><b> sons of Rabban</b><b> Gamliel, who bathed together in Kabul, and the entire city</b><b> denounced them </b>and <b>said: In all our days we have</b><b> never seen that </b>type of conduct. <b>Hillel stole </b>away <b>and</b><b> went out to the outer chamber and did not want</b><b> to tell them: You are permitted </b>to do so.

            "Similarly, <b>one </b>may <b>go out with wide </b><b>shoe</b><b>s</b> that resemble slippers <b>on Shabbat; however, one does not</b><b> go out with wide shoes </b>in the city of <b>Birei</b><b>.

            "Similarly, <b>one may sit on gentiles’ stool</b><b>s</b><b> on Shabbat, </b>even though these stools are typically used for displaying merchandise. <b>And </b>there was <b>an incident involving Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who </b><b>sat on gentiles’ stools in </b>the city of <b>Akko, and </b><b>the entire city denounced him. They said: In all our </b><b>days we have never seen that </b>type of conduct.

The Gemara answers: The legal status of <b>people in the cities</b><b>,</b><b> since Sages are not found </b><b>among them, is like </b>that of <b>the Samaritans. </b>Therefore, it is prohibited to tell them that these activities are permitted. ", 
            "The Gemara proceeds to clarify the reasons for the stringent customs in those communities. <b>Granted, </b>sitting on <b>gentiles’ stools </b>is prohibited <b>because it appears like </b>one is engaged <b>in buying and</b><b> selling </b>on Shabbat. In the case of <b>wide shoes as</b><b> well, </b>the Sages prohibited wearing them due to the concern <b>lest they fall off </b>one’s feet <b>and he come</b><b> to carry them </b>in his hand <b>four cubits in the</b><b> public domain, </b>thereby violating a Torah prohibition. ", 
            "<b>However, what is the reason that </b>two brothers <b>may</b><b> not bathe </b>together? The Gemara answers: The custom to prohibit doing so is based on that which <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person </b>may <b>bathe with anyone except</b><b> for his father, and his father-in-law, and his</b><b> mother’s husband, and his sister’s husband. </b>Due to the nature of their relation, one might come to ponder how they came to be related and have prohibited thoughts about intimacy between men and women. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda </b><b>permits </b>one to bathe <b>with his father, due to the </b><b>honor </b>that he can accord <b>his father </b>by assisting his father while bathing. <b>The same is true for one’s </b><b>mother’s husband. </b>", 
            "<b>And </b>the people of Kabul <b>came and issued a </b><b>decree </b>to prohibit bathing together <b>for two brothers, due to </b>their concern that it is similar to bathing with <b>one’</b><b>s sister’s husband.

            "The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabba bar bar Ḥan</b><b>a</b> <b>came </b>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he ate </b>the fat found <b>over the straight </b><b>part </b>of an animal’s stomach. The fat along the stomach consists of two parts: The inner, straight portion, which is shaped like a bowstring, and the outer, rounded portion, which is shaped like a bow. With regard to the fat surrounding the inner, straight portion, the custom in Eretz Yisrael was lenient, whereas in Babylonia it was stringent. <b>Rav </b><b>Avira the Elder and Rabba, son </b>of <b>Rav Huna, entered </b><b>to </b>see Rabba bar bar Ḥana. <b>When he saw them</b> coming, <b>he concealed from them </b>what he was eating. <b>They came and told Abaye </b>what had happened, and <b>he </b><b>said to them: </b>Through his conduct, <b>he rendered you Samaritans, </b>as he could have told you that it is permitted but did not do so.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And is Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b>, who was lenient with regard to a matter that is prohibited, <b>not </b>in agreement with <b>that which we learned </b>in the mishna: When one travels from one place to another, the Sages <b>impose </b><b>upon him the stringencies of the place from which he </b><b>left and the stringencies of the place to which he </b><b>went?

            "Since the Gemara discussed the point when Sabbatical Year produce must be removed in different places, it cites a mishna from tractate <i>Shevi’it</i> that deals with a similar topic. <b>We learned there </b>in a mishna: Eretz Yisrael is divided into <b>three </b>separate <b>land</b><b>s</b> with regard <b>to removal</b><b>,</b><b> Judea, Transjordan, and the Galilee</b><b>.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Read </b>the phrase as both <b>in the land</b> and <b>in your land. </b>It is possible to derive two <i>halakhot</i> from this verse; one <i>halakha</i> is with regard to Eretz Yisrael in general, i.e., one may not perform removal outside of Eretz Yisrael, the land, and one is with regard to the different lands within Eretz Yisrael, your land. <b>Alternatively, </b>the second <i>halakha</i> can be derived <b>from </b>the extraneous words in the expression: <b>“That are in your</b><b> land,” </b>as the Torah could have sufficed with the phrase: “In your land.” ",

            "The Gemara continues to discuss the <i>halakhot</i> of the Sabbatical Year: <b>Rabbi Elai chopped </b>down a palm tree containing <b>unripe dates of the Sabbatical Year. </b>The Gemara asks: <b>How did he do this?

            "The Gemara elaborates on this <i>Tosefta</i>: A good <b>sign for mountains</b><b> is gallnut </b>oaks, a good <b>sign for valleys is </b><b>palm </b>trees.

            "A good <b>sign for streams is reeds. </b>The case where this sign makes a <b>practical </b>halakhic <b>difference </b>is with regard <b>to </b>the <b>rough </b>dried-up <b>stream </b>mentioned in the Torah. When a corpse is found between two towns and the murderer cannot be identified, the Torah states that a calf’s neck is broken in a rough stream. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that growing reeds identify the spot as a stream. A good <b>sign for the plain is a sycamore </b>tree. The Gemara explains that the case where this sign makes a <b>practical</b><b> difference </b>is with regard <b>to buying and selling. </b>If one stipulates that he is buying land in the plains, it is defined as an area where sycamore trees grow. The Gemara notes: <b>Now that you have arrived at this </b>practical halakhic difference with regard <b>to </b>assessing the quality of land for the purpose of transactions, <b>all </b>the signs can be understood as pertaining <b>to buying and selling as well, </b>to identify valleys and mountainous regions.", 
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Apropos different local customs discussed in the first mishna in this chapter, this mishna discusses various <i>halakhot</i> with regard to which there are different customs. In <b>a place where </b>the people <b>were accustomed to </b><b>sell small livestock to gentiles, one </b>may <b>sell </b>them. In <b>a place where </b>the people <b>were not accustomed to sell </b>them due to certain concerns and decrees, <b>one </b>may <b>not </b><b>sell </b>them.

", 
            "The mishna cites another custom related to Passover. In <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to eat roasted </b>meat <b>on Passover </b><b>evenings</b><b>,</b> outside of Jerusalem or after the Temple was destroyed, <b>one </b>may <b>eat </b>it. In <b>a place where </b>people <b>were accustomed not to eat </b>outside Jerusalem, <b>one </b>may <b>not </b><b>eat </b>it.", 
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav</b><b> Yehuda said </b>that <b>Rav said </b>that it is <b>prohibited for</b><b> a person to say </b>in modern times: <b>This meat is</b><b> for </b><b>Passover</b><b>,</b> <b>due to </b>the fact <b>that one appears</b><b> to be consecrating his animal </b>as his Paschal lamb, and he thereby <b>eats consecrated </b>items <b>outside </b>the permitted area. <b>Rav</b><b> Pappa said: </b>This prohibition against saying: This is for Passover, applies <b>specifically </b>to <b>meat, </b>which is similar to consecrated meat; <b>however, </b>with regard to <b>wheat, no, </b>it does not apply. In that case, it is clear that one <b>is saying</b><b> that </b>the flour <b>be watched for Passover. </b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>with regard to <b>meat </b>is that <b>not </b>the case? Is it really prohibited to say that meat is for Passover? The Gemara <b>raises an objection. Rabbi Yosei said: Theodosius [</b><b>Todos</b><b>]</b><b> of Rome, </b>leader of the Jewish community there, <b>instituted the custom for the Roman </b>Jews <b>to eat </b><b>kids roasted [</b><b><i>mekulas</i></b><b>]</b><b> whole </b>with their entrails over their heads <b>on the evenings of Passover, </b>as was the custom in the Temple. The Sages <b>sent </b>a message <b>to him</b><b>: If you were not Theodosius, </b>an important person, <b>I would</b><b> have decreed ostracism upon you, as </b>it appears as if <b>you are feeding Israel consecrated food, </b>which may be eaten only in and around the Temple itself, <b>outside </b>the permitted area. The Gemara asks about the terminology used here: <b>Could</b><b> it enter your mind </b>that this meat was actually <b>consecrated</b> meat? That was certainly not the case. <b>Rather, say </b>instead: "
        ], 
        [
            "Doing so <b>is akin to feeding Jews </b><b>consecrated </b>meat <b>outside </b>the permitted area, as due to its resemblance to the Paschal lamb it could be misleading. The Gemara analyzes this statement: A goat <b>roasted whole, yes, </b>it is prohibited; a goat <b>not roasted whole, no, </b>it is not prohibited. This contradicts Rav, who prohibited roasting even ordinary meat. The Sages <b>say </b>that this is the distinction: With regard to a goat <b>roasted whole, there is no </b><b>difference </b>if <b>one said </b>it is for Passover, and <b>there </b><b>is no difference </b>if one <b>did not say </b>it is for Passover. In either case, it looks like a sacrifice and it is prohibited. With regard to a goat <b>not </b><b>roasted whole, </b>if <b>one specified </b>that it is for Passover, <b>yes, </b>it is prohibited because it appears that he is consecrating it as a sacrifice. However, if <b>one did not </b><b>specify</b> that it is for Passover, <b>no, </b>it is not prohibited, as there is no need for concern.", 
            "<b>Rav Aḥa teaches this </b><b><i>baraita</i></b> about Theodosius <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. </b><b>Rav Sheshet strongly objected to this: Granted, </b>according <b>to the </b><b>one who learns it in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, </b>it works out <b>well. However, </b>according <b>to the </b><b>one who teaches </b>it <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, does </b>it work out <b>well?

In that case, the Rabbis say he is required to bring a meal-offering of wheat because in the first part of his statement he vowed to bring a meal-offering. ", 
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon exempts </b>him from any obligation, as in his opinion, <b>he did not donate in the manner </b>typical <b>of donors. </b>In other words, Rabbi Shimon relates to the statement: A meal-offering of barley, as a single entity.

Similarly, with regard to Passover, since one can consecrate only a living animal as a sacrifice and cannot consecrate meat as a sacrifice, if one declares: This meat is for Passover, it is in no way similar to consecrating an animal, and the meat has no sanctity. ", 
            "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And </b>according to <b>the one who teaches it in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, does </b>it work out <b>well?

According to Rabbi Meir, one is held accountable for the beginning of his statement. Since he mentioned the burnt-offering first, the animal assumes the status of a burnt-offering. However, Rabbi Yosei says that the one’s entire statement is significant, and that the animal is consecrated for two sacrifices. The owner must wait until the animal becomes blemished, redeem it, and use the money to purchase a burnt-offering and a peace-offering. Rabbi Shimon holds in accordance with Rabbi Yosei’s opinion concerning a barley meal-offering. He maintains that one is held accountable not only for his first expression, i.e., that it is a meal-offering, but also for his second expression, i.e., that it is of barley. In that case, the second part of his statement negates the first part. ", 
            "<b>What, is it not </b>concluded <b>from </b>the fact <b>that</b><b> Rabbi Shimon holds in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b><b> Yosei, Rabbi Yosei </b>also <b>holds in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, </b>that if one did not donate in the manner typical of donors, his act is meaningless? If that is the case, then any difficulty for the opinion of Rabbi Shimon would be similarly difficult for the opinion of Rabbi Yosei.

            "<b>A dilemma was raised before </b>the Sages with regard to the above incident. <b>Was Theodosius of Rome a great</b><b> ma</b><b>n</b> in terms of his Torah scholarship, and the Sages refrained from ostracizing him in deference to the Torah that he studied? <b>Or, was he a violent man </b>who could not be punished due to his local influence?

            "<b>They drew an </b><b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b><b> inference on their own from </b>the plague of <b>frogs </b>in Egypt.

            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna discusses additional differences between local customs.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was taught </b>in th<i>e Tosefta</i>: <b>Both </b>in a place <b>where </b>the Sages <b>said to kindle </b><b>and </b>in a place <b>where they said not to kindle, </b><b>they both intended to </b>achieve the <b>same objective, </b>i.e., to distance people from sin, as conjugal relations are prohibited on Yom Kippur. Those who said that one kindles a lamp believe that because people do not engage in relations while a lamp is lit, the lamp will discourage intimacy.

            "On the topic of kindling a lamp for Yom Kippur, the Gemara discusses a related point. <b>Rav Yehuda said </b>that <b>Shmuel said: One</b><b> should recite the blessing over fire: </b>Who creates the lights of fire, <b>only at the conclusion of Shabbat, since </b>the conclusion of Shabbat <b>is </b>the time of <b>its original creation</b><b>.

            "<b>Ravina said: Actually</b><b>, </b>it can be explained that Rabbi Yehuda is referring <b>to</b><b> Judea. </b>With regard to a plant <b>taking root, we state</b> only <b>once </b>the principle: The legal status of <b>part of</b><b> the day is like </b>that of <b>the entire </b>day, but we <b>do not state twice </b>the principle: The legal status of <b>part of the day is like </b>that of <b>the</b><b> entire </b>day.

            "<b>Rava raised an objection: </b>We learned in our mishna that <b>on the eves of Passover </b>the daily offering <b>is slaughtered at seven and a half </b>hours <b>and sacrificed at eight and a half </b>hours, <b>both during</b><b> the week and on Shabbat. And if it could enter</b><b> your mind </b>to say <b>that </b>the daily offering must be slaughtered at <b>eight and a half hours by Torah law</b><b>, how can we do it earlier </b>merely for convenience?", 
            "<b>Rather, </b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s source is rejected, and instead <b>Rava</b><b> said: The mitzva of the daily offering </b>is <b>from when</b><b> the </b>sun begins to descend westward so that the <b>evening</b><b> shadows slant </b>eastward, shortly after midday. <b>What is the</b><b> reason </b>for this?

Rabbi Yosei says that not only the beginning but also the conclusion of his statement is significant, and the animal has been consecrated as both a burnt-offering and a peace-offering. It is therefore unfit to be offered on the altar; rather, it must be sold when it develops a defect and the money used to purchase animals for both a burnt-offering and a peace-offering. And similarly in the case of our mishna, where the priest says that his intent is for the purpose of a Paschal lamb and for the purpose of a peace-offering, Rabbi Yosei would say that the animal has been slaughtered for both a Paschal lamb and a peace-offering, and is therefore disqualified.", 
            "<b>For if </b>our mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, </b>surely <b>he said: Hold </b>one accountable for <b>the first expression, </b>and what he says after that is of no consequence. Rabbi Meir disagrees with Rabbi Yosei about the case of one who says: This animal is a burnt-offering and a peace-offering, for he maintains that the sacrifice has the status of a burnt-offering. Since the first term that he uttered was burnt-offering, the animal is consecrated as a burnt-offering, and it can no longer become a peace-offering. And similarly in the case of our mishna, where the priest says that his intent is for the purpose of a Paschal lamb and for the purpose of a peace-offering, Rabbi Meir would say that the animal has been slaughtered only for a Paschal lamb and the offering is fit.

The question raised here is whether or not partial intent to slaughter the animal as a peace-offering rather than as a Paschal lamb suffices to validate the offering.", 
            "<b>When Rav Dimi</b><b> cam</b><b>e</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: I </b><b>raised this question in the presence of Rabbi Yirmeya </b>and expressed my opinion: <b>Since </b>intent to offer the sacrifice <b>for </b><b>its own purpose validates it at its proper time, </b>i.e., on the eve of Passover, <b>and </b>intent to offer the sacrifice <b>for a different purpose validates it not at</b><b> its proper time, </b>i.e., the rest of the year, there is room to equate the two situations. <b>Just </b>as intent <b>for its own purpose, which validates it at its</b><b> proper time, does not nullify </b>the intent to offer the sacrifice <b>for a different purpose, </b>i.e., if one intends to offer the sacrifice both for its own purpose and for a different purpose it is disqualified, <b>so too, </b>intent to offer the sacrifice <b>for a different purpose, which </b><b>validates it not at its proper time, does not nullify </b>the intent to offer the sacrifice <b>for its own purpose, </b><b>and it is disqualified. </b>It can be concluded from here that whenever one’s thoughts concerning an offering are a combination of validating and disqualifying intentions, the offering is disqualified.",

But <b>can you </b>necessarily <b>say </b>the same thing <b>about </b>the intent to slaughter a Paschal lamb <b>for its own purpose</b> at other times of the year, a disqualification <b>that does</b><b> not apply to all offerings but to the Paschal lamb</b><b> alone? </b>Only the Paschal lamb is disqualified if it is slaughtered for its own purpose not at its proper time, and therefore intent for a different purpose can indeed nullify intent for its own purpose.", 
            "Rav Dimi’s argument having been refuted, the Gemara asks: <b>What </b>conclusion was reached <b>about </b>Rav Dimi’s question? <b>Rava said: A Paschal lamb</b><b> that one slaughtered on the rest of the days of</b><b> the year </b>with the intent that it be <b>for its</b><b> own purpose and for a different purpose is valid. </b>The reason for this is as follows: <b>In an </b>otherwise <b>undetermined </b>situation, the animal <b>stands </b>to be offered <b>for its </b><b>own purpose, </b>for one did not rescind its status as a Paschal lamb either verbally or by intent. <b>But nevertheless, </b><b>when he slaughters it for a different purpose, it is </b><b>valid.</b>", 
            "<b>Apparently, </b>then, the intent to offer the sacrifice <b>for a different purpose comes and nullifies </b>the presumed intent to offer it <b>for its own purpose; </b>the statement that one makes to slaughter the offering as a peace-offering rather than as a Paschal lamb has the power to remove it from its previous status as a Paschal lamb. Accordingly, we should <b>also </b>say that <b>when </b>the priest <b>slaughters </b>the animal both <b>for its own purpose </b><b>and for a different purpose, </b>the intent to offer it <b>for a different purpose </b>carries more weight and <b>comes and </b><b>nullifies </b>the stated intent to offer it <b>for its own </b><b>purpose. </b>", 
            "<b>Rav</b><b> Adda bar Ahava said to Rava: Perhaps </b>a case <b>where</b> one explicitly <b>said </b>that he was slaughtering the offering for its own purpose and for a different purpose <b>is different</b><b> from </b>a case <b>where he did not say </b>this. The proof of this is that if one slaughtered the Paschal lamb <b>for those who can eat it and those </b><b>who cannot eat it, it is valid, but wherever he </b><b>slaughters it only for the sake of those who cannot </b><b>eat it, it is disqualified. Now, why </b>should this be? <b>Surely in an </b>otherwise <b>undetermined </b>situation, the animal <b>stands </b>to be offered <b>for those who can eat it. </b>This indicates that presumed intention cannot be equated with intention that is explicitly verbalized. <b>Rather, </b>a case <b>where </b>one explicitly <b>said </b>that he is slaughtering the animal for those who can eat it and those who cannot eat it <b>is different from</b> a case <b>where he did not say </b>this. <b>So </b><b>too, </b>a case <b>where he </b>explicitly <b>said </b>that he is slaughtering the offering for its own purpose and for a different purpose <b>is different from </b>a case <b>where he did </b><b>not say </b>this.

            "Rava <b>said to him: Are </b>the two cases <b>comparable? </b><b>Granted, there, </b>with regard to the Paschal lamb and the purpose for which it is offered, <b>as long as </b>one <b>did not uproot </b>the animal’s status as a Paschal lamb <b>at </b>the time of <b>slaughter, in an </b>otherwise <b>undetermined</b> situation, <b>it certainly stands </b>to be offered <b>for its own</b><b> purpose; </b>its standing as a Paschal lamb can be changed only if it is explicitly designated as something else. <b>But</b><b> here, </b>with regard to a Paschal lamb and the people for whom it is slaughtered, <b>in an </b>otherwise <b>undetermined </b>situation, <b>does it stand </b>to be slaughtered <b>for those who </b>are registered to <b>eat it?</b>", 
            "This is not the case, for in the instance of every Paschal lamb, there is the possibility that <b>perhaps these will</b><b> withdraw and others will come and register for it.

This is different from slaughtering a Paschal lamb not in its time, for in that case the offering maintains its previous status as a Paschal lamb until its status is explicitly changed through a verbal statement.

The only exception is the Paschal lamb, which when brought for another purpose is invalid. According to Rabbi Yehoshua, in both of these cases the animal is not truly a Paschal lamb; rather, it is a peace-offering brought with the intent that it serve as a Paschal lamb.", 
            "The Gemara infers: <b>The reason </b>that the sacrifice is disqualified <b>is </b>that it was brought <b>at its </b>proper <b>time; </b>it is in this case that the <i>tanna</i><i>’im</i> disagree. <b>But if it was not </b>brought <b>at its</b> proper <b>time, it is valid </b>according to everyone, as it is like any other peace-offering that was slaughtered for a different purpose. <b>But why </b>is this so? <b>Let us</b><b> say: Since </b>slaughtering another sacrifice for the purpose of a Paschal lamb <b>disqualifies </b>it <b>at its </b>proper <b>time</b><b>,</b> this should <b>also disqualify </b>it <b>not at its </b>proper <b>time. </b>Consequently, the ruling quoted above is difficult according to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, who accepts the principle of since for the sake of stringency.",

            "<b>Rather, Abaye</b><b> said </b>the following explanation: We are dealing with a case where the person expressed two different intentions within the act of slaughter itself, as valid slaughter involves cutting most of both the windpipe and the esophagus of the animal. <b>The</b><b> first clause </b>is referring to a case where <b>he said</b><b>: </b>I cut <b>the first </b>organ <b>for circumcised people and the</b><b> second </b>organ <b>even for uncircumcised people, so that in </b><b>the second </b>organ <b>even circumcised people are included. </b>Consequently, he had circumcised people in mind at each stage of the slaughtering. <b>The latter clause </b>is referring to a case where <b>he said: </b>I cut <b>the first </b>organ <b>for uncircumcised people </b>and <b>the second </b>organ <b>for circumcised people, so that in </b><b>the first </b>organ <b>circumcised people are not included, </b>and his intent during that stage is solely for uncircumcised people.",

The question arises as to whether punishments are administered after an uncertain warning, i.e., when it is unclear at the time of the warning whether or not the person being warned will actually transgress. It is possible to explain that this is the basis of the dispute with regard to leaven: If the leaven is outside the Temple courtyard, the one issuing the warning cannot be certain that the person he is warning actually has leaven in his possession at the time of the slaughter. The Gemara suggests that such a warning is considered an uncertain warning, and Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that an uncertain warning is a valid warning while Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish disagrees.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The</b><b> Paschal lamb is slaughtered only in three groups of </b>at least <b>thirty people </b>each. <b>What is the reason </b>for this rule? The verse says: <b>Assembly, congregation, and Israel, </b>and each of these terms refers to a group of no fewer than ten people. <b>We are uncertain </b>as to whether this means that we need three groups of ten people <b>at the same time </b>or <b>one after another. </b>", 
            "<b>Therefore, </b>in order to satisfy both possible interpretations, <b>we require three groups of thirt</b><b>y</b><b> people </b>each. <b>As, if </b>you say we need all thirty <b>at the </b><b>same time, </b>we <b>have </b>that, <b>and if </b>we need them <b>one after another, </b>we <b>have </b>that as well. <b>Therefore, </b>in pressing circumstances when there are not enough people present, <b>even </b><b>fifty </b>people <b>suffice. </b>How so? <b>Thirty enter and perform </b>the necessary rite, <b>ten </b>others <b>enter and ten </b>of the original group <b>leave </b>so that those present are considered a new group, <b>and </b>then <b>ten </b>others <b>enter and ten </b>more <b>leave</b> so that those present now comprise a third group.

            "<b>The Sages taught: Once, King Agripp</b><b>a</b><b> wished to set </b><b>his eyes on the multitudes [</b><b><i>ukhlosin</i></b><b>]</b><b> of Israel </b>to know how many they were.

            "The Gemara questions one of the details of this story: How could the High Priest <b>take</b><b> a kidney? </b>Didn’t <b>he have to burn it </b>on the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>He </b>first took the kidneys for the count, and <b>subsequently he burned them. </b>The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it written: “And </b>the priest <b>shall </b><b>burn it </b>on the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire to the Lord” (Leviticus 3:11)? The singular “it” apparently indicates that <b>he must not mix </b>the <b>fat</b><b>s</b><b> of this </b>sacrifice <b>with </b>those of <b>another; </b>rather, he must burn each set separately. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>He subsequently burned </b><b>them one by one </b>and not all together. The Gemara asks further: <b>Wasn’t it taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that the plural “them” in the verse: “And the priest <b>shall </b><b>burn them </b>upon the altar; it is the food of the offering made by fire for a satisfying aroma; all the fat is the Lord’s” (Leviticus 3:16) indicates <b>that </b><b>all </b>the sacrificial parts of a sacrifice must be offered <b>at the same time? Rather, </b>it must be that when the High Priest took a kidney for counting, it was <b>merely </b>momentary <b>seizure; </b>that is, <b>he took it from them</b><b> until they brought him something else </b>with which to keep track of the numbers, and it was this other item that was counted afterward. ", 
            "It was stated in the mishna that <b>the priests stood in rows </b>and that there were rows of priests holding silver bowls and rows of priests holding gold bowls, but that in no rows were there both gold and silver bowls. <b>What is the reason </b>that there was no intermingling of gold and silver bowls? <b>If you say </b>that it was due to concern that <b>perhaps </b>a priest <b>would take a gold </b>bowl to keep for himself <b>and </b>then <b>return a silver </b>one in its place, the solution described in the mishna does not alleviate this concern. <b>Here, too, </b>in a row where everyone is holding gold bowls, there is concern that <b>perhaps </b>a priest <b>would take a two-hundred-</b>dinar bowl, keep it for himself, <b>and </b>then <b>return a </b>one-hundred-dinar bowl in its place (Rid). <b>Rather, </b>the reason is <b>that this </b>arrangement, where all the bowls in each row are of the same color, <b>is </b>aesthetically <b>more attractive. </b>", 
            "It was further stated in the mishna that <b>the bowls</b><b> did not have </b>flat <b>bases. </b>The Gemara adds that <b>the</b><b> Sages taught </b>a <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>None of the </b><b>bowls in the Temple had </b>flat <b>bases </b>for the same reason, so that they should not be put down, which would allow the blood to congeal.

They could not have sharp bottoms out of concern that <b>perhaps </b>the priests <b>would rest them on the bread and the bread</b><b> would break</b><b>.</b> The showbread had an intricate and delicate shape, and a bowl with a sharp bottom could pierce or break the bread. ", 
            "It was taught in the mishna: <b>An Israelite would slaughter </b>the offering <b>and a </b><b>priest would receive </b>the blood and pass it to other priests. The Gemara asks: <b>Is it not sufficient </b>if someone who is <b>not an Israelite </b>slaughters the offering? Must the ritual slaughter be performed specifically by an Israelite, and not by a priest or a Levite? The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>teaches us this </b><i>halakha</i> <b>itself, that </b>even if the <b>slaughter </b>is performed <b>by a non-priest </b>it <b>is valid. </b>And that which was stated in the mishna that <b>the </b><b>priest receives </b>the blood <b>comes to teach us that from </b><b>receiving and onward </b>the rite is <b>a commandment </b>cast <b>upon </b><b>the priesthood, </b>and a non-priest may not perform it.", 
            "It was also taught in the mishna that the priest would <b>pass </b>the bowl of blood <b>to </b><b>another </b>priest. The Gemara suggests: <b>Learn from this that carrying</b><b> without walking, </b>i.e., transporting the blood to the altar by passing it from hand to hand without actually walking with it to the altar, <b>is </b>considered a valid act of <b>carrying </b>the blood of a sacrifice to the altar, one of the four rites involved in the offering of a sacrifice. This would resolve the same unanswered question in tractate <i>Zevaḥim</i>. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Perhaps </b>the priest <b>would move a little </b>with his feet as he passed the bowl to the next priest, in order to fulfill the requirement to walk with the blood to the altar. <b>Rather, what does this </b>account of how they transported the blood to the altar <b>teach us? </b>The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us </b>that the priests were arranged in rows in order to increase the number of people involved in the rite and fulfill the principle that <b>“in the</b><b> multitude of people is the king’s glory” </b>(Proverbs 14:28). ", 
            "It was further stated in the mishna that each priest would <b>receive a full </b>bowl of blood <b>and return an</b><b> empty </b>one. The Gemara infers: <b>But the opposite </b>was <b>not</b> done; the priest would not first return an empty bowl and then receive a full one. This <b>supports </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b><b> said: One must not postpone </b>the performance of <b>mitzvot. </b>When one is presented with the opportunity to fulfill a mitzva, he must do so immediately and not delay for any reason. In this case, since bringing the blood to the altar is a mitzva, the priest should first fulfill the mitzva at hand and receive the full bowl of blood, and only then should he return the empty bowl. ", 
            "It was also stated in the mishna that <b>the </b><b>priest who was closest to the altar </b>would sprinkle the blood upon the altar. <b>Who is the </b><b><i>tanna</i></b> who holds that the blood of <b>the Paschal lamb </b>requires <b>sprinkling </b>from afar upon the altar, and that pouring the blood directly from the bowl onto the altar does not suffice? <b>Rav </b><b>Ḥisda said: It is Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b>", 
            "<b>As it was </b><b>taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: </b>The verse states: “But the firstborn of an ox, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem, they are sacred; <b>you shall sprinkle </b><b>their blood upon the altar and you shall burn their </b><b>fat </b>for an offering made by fire, for a satisfying aroma to the Lord” (Numbers 18:17). <b>It is not stated:</b><b> Its blood, but </b>rather <b>“their blood.” </b>Similarly, <b>it is </b><b>not stated: Its fat, but </b>rather <b>“their fat.” </b>This <b>teaches</b><b> with regard to the firstborn </b>animal, which is mentioned explicitly in the verse, as well as <b>the tithed animal and</b><b> the Paschal lamb, </b>which have a level of sanctity similar to a firstborn animal, <b>that they </b>all <b>require placement of</b><b> their blood and sacrificial parts on the altar, </b>although the Torah does not give explicit instructions with regard to this aspect of the rite for a tithed animal or Paschal lamb.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we </b>derive that their blood <b>requires </b>sprinkling upon the altar on a side that has a <b>base? </b><b>Rabbi Elazar said: This is derived </b>by way of a verbal analogy between the word <b>sprinkling </b>used here and the word <b>sprinkling </b>used <b>with regard to a burnt-offering.

            "It was stated in the next clause of the mishna that after <b>the first group exited, </b>the second group and then the third group would enter. <b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> with regard to the third group: <b>It</b><b> was called the lazy grou</b><b>p</b> because it was the last of the three groups.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>Nonetheless, </b>the members of the third group <b>should have hurried themselves </b>so that they would not be in the last group. <b>As </b>it <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The world</b><b> cannot </b>function <b>without a perfume merchan</b><b>t</b><b> or without a </b><b>tanner [</b><b><i>bursi</i></b><b>]</b><b>,</b> who processes bad-smelling hides.

The Paschal offering consisted of either a lamb or a goat, sometimes quite young and unable to walk the entire way, so that it had to be carried on a person’s shoulders. Similarly, <b>bringing it</b><b> from outside the Shabbat limit and cutting off its wart</b><b> do not override Shabbat, </b>as all these tasks could have been performed before Shabbat. A wart is considered a blemish that disqualifies the animal from being brought as an offering, but once the wart is removed, the animal is fit to be sacrificed on the altar. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: </b>All of these procedures <b>override </b>Shabbat.

            "<b>Rabbi </b><b>Eliezer said to him: What is this, Yehoshua? </b>How can you suggest such a weak proof? <b>What proof </b>can be deduced from <b>optional </b>activities that would apply <b>to a mitzva? </b>How does the fact that rabbinic decrees remain in effect on a Festival with respect to optional activities prove that one is also forbidden to transgress a rabbinic decree in order to fulfill the mitzva of offering the Paschal lamb? <b>Rabbi Akiva responded and said </b>in defense of Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion: <b>Sprinklin</b><b>g</b> the purifying water of a red heifer upon someone who had contracted ritual impurity through contact with a corpse <b>proves </b>the matter, <b>for it is </b>done <b>for</b> the sake of <b>a mitzva, </b>in order to allow the person to offer the Paschal lamb, <b>and it is </b>prohibited only <b>due to rabbinic decree, and </b>nonetheless <b>it does not</b><b> override Shabbat, </b>for the purification rite is not performed on the eve of Passover that falls on Shabbat. <b>So, too</b><b>, you should not be surprised about these </b>activities, namely carrying the animal, bringing it from outside the Shabbat limit, and cutting off its wart, <b>that although they are </b>performed <b>for</b> the sake of <b>a mitzva and they are </b>prohibited only <b>due to rabbinic decree, they do not override Shabbat.</b>",

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught </b>a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the basic <i>halakha</i> governing the eve of Passover that <b>occurs </b>on Shabbat: <b>This law was forgotten by the</b><b> sons of </b><b>Beteira</b><b>,</b> who were the leaders of their generation. <b>The fourteenth </b>of Nisan <b>once occurred on Shabbat, </b>and <b>they forgot and did not know whether the Paschal lamb</b><b> overrides Shabbat or not. They said: Is there any person</b><b> who knows whether the Paschal lamb overrides Shabbat or not</b><b>? They said to them: There is a certain man </b>in Jerusalem <b>who came up from Babylonia, and </b><b>Hille</b><b>l</b> <b>the </b><b>Babylonian is his name. </b>At one point, <b>he served the </b><b>two </b>most <b>eminent </b>scholars <b>of the generation, Shemaya and </b><b>Avtalyon</b><b>,</b> <b>and </b>he certainly <b>knows whether the Paschal lamb overrides </b><b>Shabbat or not. </b>The sons of Beteira <b>sent </b>messengers <b>and </b><b>called for him. They said to him: Do you know </b><b>whether the Paschal lamb overrides Shabbat or not? He said </b><b>to them: Have we </b>but <b>one Paschal lamb during the </b><b>year that overrides Shabbat? Do we not have many more </b><b>than two hundred Paschal </b><b>lambs</b><b>,</b> i.e., sacrifices, <b>during </b><b>the year that override Shabbat? </b>", 
            "<b>They said to him: From where do you </b>know this? <b>He said to them: “Its appointed time” is stated </b><b>with regard to the Paschal lamb and “its appointed time” </b><b>is </b>also <b>stated with regard to the daily offering, </b>for the verse says: “Command the children of Israel and say to them, My offering, the provision of My sacrifice made with fire, for a sweet savor to Me, shall you observe to offer Me at its appointed time” (Numbers 28:2). From here we learn that the daily offering is brought even on Shabbat. Thus, the daily morning and afternoon offerings are brought on more than fifty <i>Shabbatot</i> over the course of the year, and two sheep are offered every Shabbat as additional offerings, for a total of more than two hundred sacrifices a year that override Shabbat. <b>Just as </b>the expression <b>“its appointed time,” which is stated with regard to</b><b> the daily offering, </b>indicates that it <b>overrides Shabbat, so too</b><b> “its appointed time,” which is stated with regard to the</b><b> Paschal lamb, </b>indicates that it <b>overrides </b><b>Shabbat</b><b>.</b>", 
            "<b>And furthermore</b><b>, it is an </b><b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If the daily</b><b> offering, </b>the neglect of which <b>is not punishable by </b><b><i>karet</i></b><b>, overrides Shabbat, is it not right that the Paschal </b><b>lamb, </b>the neglect of which <b>is punishable by </b><b><i>karet</i></b><b>, should </b><b>override Shabbat? </b>", 
            "After Hillel brought these proofs, <b>they </b><b>immediately seated him at the head and appointed him </b><b><i>Nasi</i></b> <b>over them, and he expounded the laws of Passover that </b><b>entire day. </b>In the course of his teaching, <b>he began rebuking them</b><b> [</b><b><i>mekanteran</i></b><b>]</b><b> them with words.

            "<b>They said to </b>Hillel: <b>Our teacher, </b>if one <b>forgot </b><b>and did not bring a knif</b><b>e</b><b> on the eve of</b><b> Shabbat </b>and cannot slaughter his Paschal lamb, <b>what is </b>the law?

            "<b>The Master said </b>above: <b>“Its</b><b> appointed time” is stated with regard to the Paschal lamb</b><b> and “its appointed time” is stated with regard to the</b><b> daily offering.

            "<b>Rather, </b>you must conclude that the expression <b>“its appointed time</b><b>,” </b>which is stated with regard to the Paschal lamb, <b>does</b><b> not indicate to </b>Hillel that the Torah was so particular about the timing of the Paschal lamb that its slaughter overrides Shabbat. <b>Here too, </b>with regard to the daily offering, you must say that <b>“its appointed time” does not </b><b>indicate to him </b>that it is brought on Shabbat, and so this expression is not the source of this law. <b>Rather, </b>the law is derived from <b>the verse </b>that <b>states: “</b><b>The burnt-</b><b>offering</b><b> of Shabbat on its Shabbat, beside the </b><b>continual burnt-</b><b>offering</b> and its libation” (Numbers 28:10), from which <b>it may be inferred that the daily burnt-</b><b>offering</b><b> is</b><b> brought </b>even <b>on Shabbat.</b>", 
            "The Gemara raises another question: <b>The Master said </b>in that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>And furthermore, it is an </b><b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b><b> inference: If the</b><b> daily offering, </b>the neglect of which <b>is not punishable by</b> <b><i>karet</i></b><b>, overrides Shabbat, is it not right that the Paschal</b><b> lamb, </b>the neglect of which <b>is punishable by </b><b><i>karet</i></b><b>, </b><b>should override Shabbat? </b>The Gemara points out that <b>there is </b><b>room to refute </b>the logic of this argument: <b>What </b>is unique about <b>the daily offering </b>that enables it to override Shabbat? <b>That it is frequent, </b>and something that is frequent always takes precedence; <b>and </b>also that it is totally <b>consumed</b> on the altar, unlike the Paschal lamb, most of which is eaten by human beings. The Gemara explains that this is what happened: Hillel <b>first told them the </b><b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b><b> inference, but they refuted i</b><b>t</b> and proved that it was not reliable, as explained above; <b>and then he told </b><b>them the verbal analogy, </b>and a verbal analogy is based on an oral tradition originating from Moses at Sinai and must be accepted.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But since </b>Hillel <b>learned </b>this <b>verbal analogy </b>from his teachers, <b>why do I </b>need <b>an </b><b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b> inference? Why did he add a logical argument of his own if he had an explicit verbal tradition that this was the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, he said it for them</b><b>, </b>to show that they had not sufficiently exerted themselves in clarifying this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Granted, you did not learn the</b><b> verbal analogy </b>on your own, because you acted according to the principle that <b>one may not expound a verbal </b><b>analogy on one’s own. </b>Since there is no limit to the laws that one can extract using this method of derivation, such a derivation is only legitimate if it has been transmitted as part of the oral tradition, and apparently they did not learn this verbal analogy from their teachers. <b>But an </b><b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b> inference, <b>which one can derive</b><b> on one’s own, you should have derived </b>and you would then have known how to resolve this question. <b>They</b><b> said to him: It is a faulty </b><b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b> inference, as we have shown that it can be easily refuted.

            "<b>The Master said </b>further in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The </b><b>next day, one whose Paschal offering was a lamb stuck </b>the knife <b>in its wool, </b>and one whose Paschal offering was a <b>goat stuck it between its horns </b>so as to avoid carrying the knife on Shabbat. "

            "The Gemara answers: <b>This </b>prohibition of consecrating an animal as a sacrifice on Shabbat or a Festival <b>applies only to obligatory </b>sacrifices <b>that</b><b> do not have a set time </b>to be brought. <b>But</b><b> obligatory </b>sacrifices <b>that have a set time, </b>such as the Paschal lamb, <b>one may consecrate </b>even on Shabbat. <b>For Rabbi</b><b> Yoḥanan said: A person may consecrate his Paschal lamb on</b><b> Shabbat and his Festival peace-</b><b>offering</b><b> on the Festival</b><b>.</b> Since these sacrifices must be brought on a specific day, they may be consecrated on that day even when it is Shabbat or a Festival, as the Sages did not uphold their decree in this circumstance.

The Gemara asks: <b>Even driving a laden</b><b> animal in an unusual manner </b>is problematic; <b>granted that </b><b>there is no prohibition by Torah law, </b>but <b>there is </b><b>at least a rabbinic prohibition. </b>When one performs a prohibited act on Shabbat in an unusual manner, he does not transgress a Torah prohibition, but nonetheless, he violates a rabbinic prohibition.",

            "The Gemara raises an additional question incidental to the previous discussion proving that the Paschal lamb overrides Shabbat: <b>We have </b><b>found </b>proofs that <b>the daily offering and the Paschal lamb </b><b>override Shabbat.

            "<b>Rather, Abaye said: Actually, </b>the law can be derived <b>from the first verse </b>quoted by Rabbi Yoḥanan: “Any man who shall be impure by reason of a corpse.” And the derivation should be understood as follows: <b>If so, </b>that the verse comes to teach that only an individual can rectify his situation on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, but not the community, <b>the Merciful One should</b><b> have written: “Any man who shall be impure.” Why do</b><b> I </b>need the words <b>“by reason of a corpse”?</b>",

", 
            "Having cited verses dealing with the requirement to send out the ritually impure from the camp, the Gemara addresses several <i>halakhot</i> relevant to that topic. <b>Rav Ḥisda</b><b> said: A leper, </b>who must be sent out from all of the camps including the Israelite camp, <b>who went</b><b> in beyond his boundary, </b>that is, he entered an area that is prohibited to him, <b>is </b>nonetheless <b>exempt </b>from the punishment of lashes. With regard to the ritually impure, the Torah states: “Both male and female shall you send out, outside the camp shall you send them, and they shall defile not their camps in the midst of which I dwell” (Numbers 5:3), from which we learn that an impure person who enters the camp is liable to receive lashes for having violated the prohibition of “they shall not defile.” A leper, however, is exempt, <b>as it is stated: </b>“All the days that the plague shall be in him he shall be impure; he is impure, <b>he shall dwell </b><b>in isolation, his dwelling shall be outside the camp” </b>(Leviticus 13:46).", 
            "The Gemara explains that the verse is explicated in the following manner: <b>“He</b><b> shall dwell in isolation” </b>means <b>he shall dwell alone, </b>without even the company of others who are impure. <b>“His </b><b>dwelling shall be outside the camp” </b>teaches that <b>the verse </b><b>has transmuted </b>the negative precept <b>into a positive mitzva</b><b>.</b> In other words, the verse establishes that if a leper entered an area that is prohibited to him, he is commanded to leave, and fulfilling this command removes the full force of the prohibition he has already violated. The rule is that lashes are not administered for the violation of a prohibition, if that violation can be rectified by the fulfillment of a positive commandment.", 
            "<b>An objection was raised against </b>Rav Ḥisda from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A leper, </b>who may not even enter the Israelite camp, <b>who went in beyond his boundary, </b>is punished <b>with forty </b>lashes like one who violates a regular Torah prohibition. Similarly, <b><i>zavin</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>zavot</i></b><b>, </b>who are prohibited from entering the Levite camp, <b>who went in beyond their </b><b>boundaries, </b>are punished <b>with forty </b>lashes. <b>And one who </b><b>is ritually impure due to </b>contact with <b>a corpse is </b><b>permitted to enter </b>even <b>the Levite camp</b><b>.</b> ", 
            "<b>And not only </b><b>did they say that one who is ritually impure due </b><b>to a corpse </b>may enter this area, <b>but even a </b><b>corpse itself </b>may be brought into the Levite camp, <b>as </b><b>it is stated: “And Moses took the bones of Joseph </b><b>with him” </b>(Exodus 13:19), the words <b>“with him” </b>implying that the bones were taken <b>within his boundary, </b>i.e., that Joseph’s coffin was found in the same area in which Moses dwelled. Since Moses was a Levite and lived in the Levite camp, it follows that even a corpse may be brought into the Levite camp. In any event, we see from the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> that a leper does in fact receive lashes for entering an area prohibited to him, against Rav Ḥisda. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>This is </b>a matter that is subject to dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b><b>, for it was</b><b> taught </b>in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>“He shall dwell in </b><b>isolation” </b>indicates that <b>he shall dwell alone, </b>meaning <b>that other </b><b>ritually impure people, </b>such as <i>zavin</i> and those who are ritually impure due to contact with a corpse, <b>should not </b><b>dwell with him. </b>One <b>might </b>have thought that <b><i>zavin</i></b><b> and </b><b>those who are ritually impure due to </b>contact with <b>a </b><b>corpse are sent to one camp, </b>meaning that the laws governing which camps they may or may not enter are the same for both. <b>Therefore, the verse states: </b>“Both male and female shall you send out, outside the camp shall you send them out, <b>and they shall defile not</b><b> their camps </b>in the midst of which I dwell” (Numbers 5:3). The plural term “camps” teaches that there are multiple camps for those who are ritually impure, so that we <b>give a camp for this one and a camp for</b><b> that one</b><b>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda</b><b>. </b>Thus, in his opinion, there are three camps: One which a leper may not enter, one which a <i>zav</i> may not enter, and one which even someone ritually impure due to contact with a corpse may not enter.", 
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is not</b><b> necessary </b>to derive this law from the plural term “camps,” for <b>surely </b>the verse <b>says: </b>“Command the children of Israel <b>that they send out from the camp any leper </b><b>and any </b><b><i>zav</i></b><b> and anyone impure by reason of a </b><b>corpse” </b>(Numbers 5:2). The verse includes an unnecessary phrase: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>say </b>only that they are to send out <b>those who are ritually impure due to a corpse, and</b><b> not say </b>anything about <b>those impure as a </b><b><i>zav</i></b><b>, and</b><b> I </b>would <b>say </b>on my own that a <i>zav</i> is obviously included in this law: <b>If those ritually impure due</b><b> to a corpse are sent out </b>from the camp, <b>all</b><b> the more so </b>is it <b>not </b>clear that <b><i>zavin</i></b> should be sent out? If so, <b>why is a </b><b><i>zav</i></b><b> stated</b><b>? To give him a second camp, </b>that is, to teach us that the law governing a <i>zav</i> is more severe than the law relating to one who is impure due to a corpse and there is an additional camp that he may not enter.", 
            "And furthermore: <b>Let </b>the verse <b>say </b>only that they are to send out a <b><i>zav</i></b><b>, and not say </b>anything about <b>a</b> <b>leper, and I </b>would <b>say </b>on my own that a leper is obviously included in this law as well: If <b><i>zavin</i></b><b> are sent out</b><b>, all the more so </b>is it <b>not </b>clear that <b>lepers</b> should be sent out? <b>Why </b>then <b>is a leper stated</b><b>? To give him a third camp </b>that he may not enter. <b>When </b>the verse <b>says </b>with regard to a leper: <b>“He shall dwell alone,” the verse has transmuted </b>the negative precept <b>into a positive command. </b>This teaches us that a leper who enters a camp that is prohibited to him does not receive lashes for his violation of a negative commandment, which is consistent with the ruling of Rav Ḥisda. ", 
            "The Gemara questions the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: We see from the discussion cited above that it was clear to Rabbi Shimon that the impurity of a <i>zav</i> is more severe than that of one who is ritually impure due to contact with a corpse, and that the impurity of a leper is even more severe than that of a <i>zav</i>. <b>What is the stringency</b><b> of a </b><b><i>zav</i></b><b> over one who is ritually impure due</b><b> to a corpse</b><b>?</b><b> That </b>the <b>impurity </b>of the <i>zav</i> <b>issues out upon him from his </b>own <b>body, </b>rather than coming from an external source, as is the case when impurity is contracted from a corpse. But <b>on the contrary</b><b>, </b>it may be argued that the legal status of <b>one</b><b> who is ritually impure due to a corpse is more</b><b> severe, as he requires sprinkling </b>of the purifying waters on the <b>third and seventh </b>days of his purification process, whereas a <i>zav</i>, who is also impure for seven days, does not require such sprinkling.", 
            "The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> not just <b>“impure” </b>but <b>“and anyone impure.” </b>The additional words come <b>to include one who is ritually impure</b><b> due to </b>contact with <b>a creeping animal. </b>He, too, is sent out from the camp like one who is impure due to contact with a corpse, <b>and </b>it is clear that the legal status of <b>a</b> <b><i>zav</i></b><b> is more severe</b><b> than one who is ritually impure due to </b>contact with <b>a creeping animal.</b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is his stringency</b><b>? </b>In what way is a <i>zav</i> more stringent than one who has contracted ritual impurity from a creeping animal? The Gemara answers: <b>As we have said, </b>that his impurity issues out upon him from his own body, unlike one who has contracted impurity from a creeping animal. But <b>on the </b><b>contrary, </b>it is possible to say that the legal status <b>a creeping animal is </b>more <b>severe, for it imparts ritual</b><b> impurity </b>even <b>through an accident. </b>A <i>zav</i> only becomes impure when it is clear that his discharge did not result from sickness or some other accident, but a person who comes into contact with a creeping animal contracts ritual impurity regardless of the circumstances of that contact. <b>They say </b>in answer to this question: "

If he has only a single discharge, he contracts a less severe ritual impurity that lasts until evening, like one who experienced a seminal emission. This first discharge establishes impurity even if it results from some accident, and no effort is made to attribute it to some other factor.", 
            "The Gemara asks further: <b>What is the stringency of</b><b> a leper over a </b><b><i>zav</i></b><b>? That </b>a confirmed leper <b>is</b><b> required to let his hair grow and rend his garments</b><b> and he is prohibited from marital relations</b><b>,</b> none of which applies to a <i>zav</i>. But <b>on the contrary, </b>there is room to say that the legal status of <b>a </b><b><i>zav</i></b><b> is </b>more <b>severe, for </b>a <i>zav</i> <b>imparts ritual </b><b>impurity to that upon which he lies or sits </b>even if he does not come into direct contact with it, <b>and he imparts ritual impurity to an earthenware vessel through </b><b>movement. </b>If he causes an earthenware vessel to move, it becomes ritually impure even if he touches it on the outside, and even if he does not touch the vessel at all. Ordinarily, an earthenware vessel becomes impure only through contact on the inside of the vessel. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>The</b><b> verse states </b>not just <b>“</b><b><i>zav</i></b><b>” </b>but <b>“and any </b><b><i>zav</i></b><b>,” </b>and this inclusive expression “any” comes <b>to include a </b><b>person who experienced a seminal emission</b><b>,</b> whose impurity is of the same type as a <i>zav</i>, <b>and </b>it is clear that the legal status of <b>a leper is more</b><b> severe than a person who experienced a seminal emission. </b>We can therefore derive through an <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i> inference that if one who experienced a seminal emission is prohibited from entering a certain camp, a leper is certainly prohibited from entering that camp.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is his stringency? </b>In what way is the legal status of a leper more severe than one who experienced a seminal emission? <b>As we said</b><b>, </b>that he must let his hair grow and rend his garments and he is prohibited to engage in marital relations. But we may ask: <b>On the contrary, </b>there is room to say that the legal status of <b>one who experienced</b><b> a seminal emission is </b>more <b>severe, for he becomes ritually</b><b> impure </b>even <b>with any amount. </b>For the Torah did not specify an amount of semen that must be emitted in order to become impure, and one therefore becomes impure upon emitting even a minute amount, whereas leprous signs do have a minimum measure. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>He holds in </b><b>accordance </b>with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it was </b><b>taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says in the name </b><b>of Rabbi Yishmael: </b>In order for <b>a </b><b><i>zav</i></b> to become ritually impure, he <b>needs </b>to experience a discharge substantial enough to cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the </b>male <b>organ</b><b>.</b><b> But the Rabbis did not agree with him. </b>Thus, according to Rabbi Natan, a <i>zav</i> only becomes ritually impure if he experiences a discharge of a particular amount. <b>And one who experienced a seminal emission is compared to </b><b>a </b><b><i>zav</i></b> and therefore the same amount of discharge is required in order to cause ritual impurity. Therefore, the ritual impurity of a leper is more severe than that of one who experienced a seminal emission, and the original <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i> inference applies.", 
            "The Gemara asks: The expressions “any <i>zav</i>” and “anyone impure” teach that their respective categories are more inclusive than one would otherwise have thought. But <b>why do I </b>need the inclusive expression <b>“</b><b>and any leper”? </b>What does the word “any” include? The Gemara explains: Since <b>it is written “any </b><b><i>zav</i></b><b>,” it is</b><b> also written “any leper,” </b>so that the wording of the verse will be consistent. ", 
            "The Gemara challenges the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda </b>quoted above: <b>Rabbi Shimon spoke well</b> when he derived the three camps from which the three different classes of people are sent out from the verse: “That they send out from the camp any leper and any <i>zav</i> and anyone impure by reason of a corpse.” How does Rabbi Yehuda counter this argument?", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>He needs that </b>verse <b>for that which was taught </b>in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b><b> Eliezer says: </b>One <b>might </b>have thought that <b>if </b><b><i>zavin</i></b><b> and</b><b> lepers pushed and entered </b>the Temple <b>courtyard during </b>the offering of <b>a Paschal lamb that is brought in </b>a state of <b>impurity, </b>when the majority of the nation are ritually impure due to contact with a corpse, that <b>perhaps they</b><b> would be liable </b>for punishment for having violated the prohibition of entering the Temple while ritually impure.

            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer </b><b>said: What is Ḥiyya bar Rav’s reason </b>for explaining the term in this manner? <b>As it is written: </b>“Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, <b>and the</b><b> ruins of the fat ones [</b><b><i>meḥim</i></b><b>] shall wanderers</b><b> eat” </b>(Isaiah 5:17). <b>From where may it be inferred </b>that this verse is in any way connected to our discussion? <b>As Rav Yosef translates </b>this verse: <b>“And the righteous</b><b> shall inherit the possessions of the wicked.” </b>This indicates that the word <i>meḥim</i>, understood by Rav Yosef as referring to the wicked, is a term of degradation. This led Ḥiyya bar Rav to interpret the mishna’s clause with regard to cleaning [<i>miḥui</i>] the intestines as referring to removing the repulsive matter inside. ", 
            "Having explained the latter part of the verse in Isaiah, the Gemara turns to the beginning of that same verse. <b>“Then</b><b> shall the lambs feed as in their pasture </b>[<b><i>kedavram</i></b><b>]</b><b>.” Menashya bar Yirmeya said that Rav said: As was</b><b> said about them </b>[<b><i>kamedubar</i></b> <b><i>bam</i></b><b>],</b> i.e., as the prophet promised. To <b>what </b>prophecy does the verse refer with the expression <b>“as was said about them”? Abaye said: </b>It is referring to the continuation of the verse: <b>“And the ruins</b><b> of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.” Rava said to</b><b> him </b>that this cannot be: <b>Granted, were it written</b> only <b>“the ruins </b>of the fat ones,” it would be possible to explain <b>as you said. Now that it is</b><b> written “and the ruins,” </b>with the addition of the word “and,” this indicates that <b>it states something else, </b>and the verse contains two separate prophecies.", 
            "<b>Rather, Rava said: </b>This verse should be understood <b>in accordance with </b>what <b>Rav </b><b>Ḥananel said that Rav said. For Rav Ḥananel said that </b><b>Rav said: In the future, the righteous will resurrect the </b><b>dead. It is written here: “Then shall the lambs feed [</b><b><i>vera’u</i></b><b>] as in their pasture,” </b>the lambs serving as an allusion to the righteous, <b>and it is written there:</b> “Tend your people with your staff, the flock of your heritage, who dwell alone in the wood, in the midst of Carmel; <b>let them feed [</b><b><i>yiru</i></b><b>] in Bashan and</b><b> Gila</b><b>d</b><b> as in the days of old” </b>(Micah 7:14).", 
            "<b> “Bashan” is </b>an allusion to the prophet <b>Elisha, who </b><b>came from the Bashan. </b>How do we know that Elisha came from Bashan? <b>As it is stated: </b>“Joel the chief, and Shafam the next, <b>and Yanai and Shafat in the </b><b>Bashan” </b>(I Chronicles 5:12), <b>and it is written: “Here is</b><b> Elisha ben Shafat who poured water on the hands of</b><b> Elijah” </b>(II Kings 3:11). <b>“Gilad” is </b>an allusion to <b>Elijah, as it is stated: “And Elijah the Tishbite, who</b><b> was of the inhabitants of Gilad, said” </b>(I Kings 17:1). Based on the similarity of the verses and the verbal analogy between the two instances of the word “feed,” we learn that in the future the righteous will be like Elijah and Elisha, who resurrected the dead.", 
            "This idea is derived from a different source as well. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan</b><b> said: In the future the righteous will resurrect the dead</b><b>, as it is stated: “Old men and old women shall</b><b> yet again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every</b><b> man with his staff in his hand for very age</b><b>” </b>(Zechariah 8:4). <b>And </b>the staff will then be used as it was used by Gehazi when Elisha sent him to bring the son of the Shunamite woman back to life, as <b>it is written: “And you shall lay my </b><b>staff on the face of the child” </b>(II Kings 4:29). ", 
            "As we have been discussing the world of the future and the resurrection of the dead, the Gemara cites additional statements on these topics. <b>Ulla raised a contradiction </b>between two verses: In one verse <b>it is written: “He will destroy death </b><b>forever, </b>and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces, and the insult of His people shall He take away from off all the earth; for the Lord has spoken” (Isaiah 25:8). <b>And </b>in another verse <b>it</b><b> is written: </b>“There shall be no more there an infant who lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; <b>for the youngest shall </b><b>die a hundred years old</b><b>”</b> (Isaiah 65:20), implying that people will live long lives, but death will not be totally eradicated. Ulla answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here, </b>in the first verse, it is referring to <b>Jews, </b>who will not die at all, while <b>there, </b>in the second verse, it is referring to <b>gentiles, </b>who will live exceedingly long lives but eventually die. The Gemara asks: <b>What are gentiles doing there</b> in the future world? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is</b><b> written: “And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and</b><b> the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and</b><b> your vineyard workers” </b>(Isaiah 61:5). ", 
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda raised a contradiction </b>between two verses: In one verse <b>it is written: “Then the moon shall be confounded </b><b>and the sun ashamed, </b>when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders will be His glory” (Isaiah 24:23), which indicates that in the future there will be no light at all from the sun or the moon. <b>And </b>elsewhere <b>it is </b><b>written: “Moreover the light of the moon shall be </b><b>as the light of the sun, and the light of </b><b>the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven </b><b>days</b><b>,</b> on the day that the Lord binds up the breach of His people and heals the stroke of their wound blow” (Isaiah 30:26), which indicates that the light of the sun and moon will be even brighter than before. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: Here, </b>where it says that the sun and the moon will be ashamed before the glow of the Divine Presence, it is referring <b>to the World</b>-<b>to</b>-<b>Come, </b>which is an entirely different world; while <b>there, </b>where it says that their light will increase, it is referring <b>to the days of </b><b>the Messiah.</b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to </b>the opinion of <b>Shmuel, </b><b>who said </b>that <b>there is no difference between this world </b><b>and the days of the Messiah except for subjugation </b>to foreign <b>kingdoms, </b>but in all other ways, including the illumination of the celestial bodies, the world order will remain unchanged, <b>what is there to say </b>to reconcile these verses? The Gemara answers: <b>This and that </b>refer <b>to the World</b>-<b>to</b>-<b>Come, and </b>it is <b>not difficult: Here, </b>where it says that the sun and the moon will be totally ashamed, it refers to <b>the camp of the Divine Presence; </b>while <b>there, </b>where it says that the light of the sun and moon will be greatly magnified, it refers to <b>the </b><b>camp of the righteous. </b>", 
            "<b>Rava raised a contradiction </b>between two parts of a verse. <b>It is written: “I put to death and I</b><b> make live” </b>(Deuteronomy 32:39) <b>and </b>in that same verse <b>it is written: “I wound and I heal.” Now </b>once it says that <b>He gives life </b>to the dead, <b>all </b><b>the more so </b>is it <b>not </b>clear that <b>He </b>can <b>heal </b>those who are still alive? What then does the second clause add to the first? <b>Rather, </b>the second clause clarifies the first one: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, </b><b>said: Those </b>same people <b>whom I put to death I </b><b>will bring to life, just as </b>those people <b>whom I </b><b>wounded I will heal. </b>In other words, the verse means to say that just as God will heal the same people He wounded, so will He revive those He put to death; and not, as the verse might otherwise have been understood, that He puts some people to death and gives life to others. ", 
            "Similarly, <b>the Sages taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“I put to death and I make live”; </b>one <b>might have thought </b>that this refers to <b>death for </b><b>one </b>person <b>and life, </b>i.e., birth, <b>for another </b>person, <b>in the customary manner of the world. </b>Therefore, <b>the verse</b><b> states: “I wound and I heal”; just as the wounding</b><b> and the healing </b>mentioned here clearly refer to the <b>same</b> person, <b>so too death and life </b>refer to the <b>same</b> person. <b>From this </b>verse, there is <b>a refutation to those</b><b> who say that there is no Torah source for the</b><b> resurrection of the dead, </b>for it is explicitly mentioned in this verse. <b>Alternatively, </b>the verse can be explained as follows: <b>At first, those whom I put to death I will</b><b> bring to life</b><b>,</b> but they will be revived with the same injuries that they had when they died; <b>and</b><b> subsequently, those whom I wounded I will heal, </b>meaning that their injuries will be healed after they are resurrected.

        [
            "We learned in the mishna that when the eve of Passover occurs on Shabbat, <b>burning </b><b>the fats </b>of the Paschal lamb overrides Shabbat. The Gemara notes that <b>it was taught </b>in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon </b><b>said: Come and see how dear is a mitzva </b>performed <b>in its </b>proper <b>time. For burning the fats and limbs </b><b>and inner fats is valid all night </b>and it would have been possible to wait until the conclusion of Shabbat and burn them at night, but nonetheless <b>we do not </b><b>wait with them until nightfall; </b>rather, we burn them immediately, even on Shabbat. ", 
            "The mishna also taught that <b>carrying </b>the Paschal lamb through a public domain, <b>bringing it </b>from outside the Shabbat limit and cutting off its wart do not override Shabbat. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction </b>from another mishna in tractate <i>Eiruvin</i>, which teaches: <b>One may cut off a wart </b>by hand on Shabbat <b>in the Temple but not in </b>the rest of <b>the </b><b>country </b>outside the Temple. <b>And if </b>the wart is to be removed <b>with an instrument, it is forbidden </b>both <b>here, </b>in the Temple, <b>and there, </b>outside the Temple. From here we see that in the Temple cutting off a wart, at least by hand, is permitted.", 
            "Two <i>amora’im</i>, <b>Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, </b>disagreed about how to resolve this contradiction. <b>One </b>of them <b>said</b><b>: </b>Both <b>this </b>mishna in <i>Pesaḥim</i> <b>and that </b>mishna in <i>Eiruvin</i> speak of cutting off the wart <b>by hand. This </b>mishna that forbids cutting it off refers to <b>a moist </b>wart, which is considered like the flesh of the animal. It is therefore prohibited by rabbinic decree to cut off the wart; and since it could have been removed before Shabbat, the decree applies even in the Temple, where rabbinic decrees are generally not applicable. <b>That </b>mishna that permits cutting it off refers to <b>a dry </b>wart, which breaks apart by itself, and so there is no prohibition even by rabbinic decree to cut it off. <b>And </b>the other <b>one said</b><b>: </b>Both <b>this </b>mishna <b>and that </b>mishna speak of cutting off <b>a moist </b>wart, <b>and </b>it is <b>not difficult. This </b>mishna that says it is permitted talks about removing the wart <b>by hand, </b>which is prohibited only by a rabbinic decree that was not applied to the Temple; whereas <b>that </b>mishna that says it is prohibited talks about removing the wart <b>with an instrument, </b>which is prohibited by Torah law and forbidden everywhere.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says </b>that <b>this </b>mishna speaks about cutting off the wart <b>by hand</b><b> and that </b>mishna speaks about cutting it off <b>with an</b><b> instrument, what is the reason that he did not state</b> like the other <i>amora</i> that <b>this and that </b>talk about cutting off the wart <b>by hand, and </b>it is <b>not</b><b> difficult; this </b>mishna speaks of <b>a moist </b>wart, while <b>that</b> mishna speaks of <b>a dry </b>wart? The Gemara answers that <b>he </b>could have <b>said to you: A dry </b>wart <b>breaks</b><b> apart </b>by itself, and so there would be no need to teach us that it may be removed. Both <i>mishnayot</i> must therefore refer to a moist wart, and the difference between them is whether the wart is being removed by hand or with an instrument. ", 
            "The Gemara reverses the question: <b>And according</b><b> to the one who says </b>that both <b>this </b>mishna <b>and</b><b> that </b>mishna talk about removing the wart <b>by hand, and</b> it is <b>not difficult; this </b>speaks of <b>a moist </b>wart while <b>that </b>speaks of <b>a dry </b>wart. <b>What is the</b><b> reason that he did not state </b>like the other <i>amora</i> that <b>this and that </b>are discussing <b>a moist </b>wart <b>and</b> it is <b>not difficult; this </b>mishna in <i>Eiruvin</i> speaks about cutting off the wart <b>by hand </b>and <b>that </b>mishna in <i>Pesaḥim</i> speaks about cutting it off <b>with an instrument? </b>The Gemara answers that <b>he </b>could have <b>said to you: </b>The case of cutting off the wart with <b>an instrument is</b><b> taught there </b>in <i>Eiruvin</i> in that very same mishna: <b>If</b> the wart is to be removed <b>with an instrument, it</b><b> is forbidden </b>both <b>here, </b>in the Temple, <b>and there, </b>outside the Temple. Therefore, there would be no reason to repeat the same <i>halakha</i> here in this mishna, as it is stated explicitly in the other mishna.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And the</b><b> other </b><i>amora</i>, how does he account for the repetition according to his explanation? The mishna <b>here teaches </b>the law with regard to <b>an instrument </b>because <b>it comes to teach us</b><b> the dispute </b>between <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua; </b>for according to our mishna, Rabbi Eliezer permits cutting off a moist wart even with an instrument in order to render the animal fit to be brought as a Paschal offering. ", 
            "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said </b>that <b>if slaughter, </b>which is ordinarily forbidden on Shabbat as a biblically prohibited labor, nevertheless overrides Shabbat when performed for the sake of the Paschal lamb, then activities that are prohibited by rabbinic decree should certainly override Shabbat when performed for that purpose. Rabbi Yehoshua disagreed, arguing that the law governing a Festival proves otherwise. Rabbi Eliezer countered that the law governing an optional activity, such as preparing food on a Festival, cannot be brought as proof with regard to the mitzva of offering the Paschal lamb. The Gemara notes that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua follows his </b>regular line of <b>reasoning, for he said </b>that <b>rejoicing on a Festiva</b><b>l</b><b> is also a mitzva, </b>and therefore whatever one does in order to enhance one’s enjoyment of the Festival is considered an act performed for the sake of a mitzva, just like the offering of a sacrifice.", 
            "<b>For it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that these two <i>tanna’im</i> disagreed about this matter: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A person has nothing but </b>to choose <b>on a Festival; he either eats and drinks or</b><b> sits and learns </b>the entire day, but there is no specific mitzva to eat on the Festival. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, </b>on the other hand, <b>says: Divide </b>the day, <b>half of </b><b>it for eating and drinking and half of it for </b><b>the study hall, </b>for he holds that eating and drinking are obligatory on the Festival.

The Gemara answers: <b>He thought that it would not </b><b>be proper </b>to tell his teacher that he had forgotten his teaching, and therefore his initial attempt was to remind him indirectly. ", 
            "The Gemara questions the reason for the <i>halakha</i> under discussion. <b>What is the reason that </b>the <b>sprinkling </b>of purifying water <b>does not override Shabbat? Since it </b>involves the <b>mere moving </b>of the liquid from the utensil in his hand to the body of the person seeking purification, why should it be forbidden on Shabbat? <b>Let it </b>at least <b>override Shabbat on account </b>of the mitzva <b>of </b><b>the Paschal lamb. Rabba said: </b>The prohibition against sprinkling is <b>a </b>rabbinic <b>decree </b>that was instituted <b>lest one take </b>the utensil containing the purifying water <b>and carry it </b>a distance of <b>four cubits in the public domain</b><b>,</b> thus violating an actual Torah prohibition. This is consistent with Rabba’s opinion in several other places in the Talmud that the Sages forbade the fulfillment of certain mitzvot due to a similar concern about carrying in the public domain.", 
            "The Gemara asks: At least <b>according to Rabbi Eliezer, let us carry </b>the purifying water even in the public domain, <b>for Rabbi Eliezer said </b>as a general rule that actions that <b>facilitate </b>the performance of <b>a mitzva override Shabbat</b><b>,</b> even if they are not mitzvot themselves and involve transgression of Torah prohibitions. <b>They </b><b>say </b>that there is room to distinguish between different situations: The rule that actions necessary to facilitate a mitzva override Shabbat only <b>applies when the person himself is fit </b>to fulfill the mitzva <b>and the obligation </b>to fulfill it <b>is </b><b>incumbent upon him. But here where the person himself is </b><b>not fit </b>to eat the Paschal lamb, as he is presently ritually impure, <b>the obligation </b>to fulfill the mitzva <b>is </b><b>incumbent upon him, </b>and therefore actions that would enable him to fulfill the mitzva do not override Shabbat.

            "<b>Rabba said: According </b><b>to the statement of Rabbi Eliezer </b>that when a person is unfit no obligation is incumbent upon him, in the case of <b>a healthy baby, one may heat water for </b><b>him to strengthen him </b>even further in order <b>to circumcise </b><b>him on Shabbat, as he is </b>already now <b>fit </b>to be circumcised.

            "<b>And </b>Rabbi Eliezer further maintains with regard to <b>any </b>form of impurity due to which <b>an individual is deferred </b>to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, that if the entire community is afflicted with it, <b>they observe </b>the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>in </b>a state of <b>ritual impurity. </b>And he accepts yet another principle: <b>Anything that applies to the community applies to an individual, </b><b>and anything that does not apply to the community does </b><b>not apply to an individual.</b>", 
            "On the basis of these principles, we can say as follows: With regard to <b>lack of circumcision, if the entire community is uncircumcise</b><b>d</b><b> we say to them: Arise, and circumcise yourselves, and offer</b><b> the Paschal lamb, </b>and we do not allow them to offer the sacrifice while uncircumcised.

            "<b>Rav Huna</b><b>, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: </b>Are these principles really correct? <b>But </b>there is <b>the second </b><b><i>Pesaḥ</i></b><b>, which </b><b>does not apply to the community and </b>yet <b>it applies </b><b>to an individual. </b>Rava <b>said to </b>Rav Huna: <b>It is </b><b>different there, as the community </b>already <b>offered </b>the Paschal lamb <b>on the first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i> in a state of ritual impurity, and therefore the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> can apply to individuals although it does not apply to the community. ", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises </b><b>an objection </b>from a <i>baraita</i> in which it was taught: One <b>might </b>have thought <b>that only one who was pure </b><b>and not on a distant journey is punishable by </b><b><i>karet</i></b> for having neglected to offer the Paschal lamb, as the Torah explicitly states that a person who was ritually impure or on a distant journey is exempt from the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> and obligated in the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.

            "The Gemara infers from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From </b>the fact that <b>he searches for </b>a source to include <b>one who is ritually impure from a creeping</b><b> animal, </b>it is clear that <b>he holds that one may</b><b> not slaughter </b>the Paschal lamb <b>or sprinkle </b>its blood <b>for</b><b> someone who is ritually impure from a creeping animal.

This being the case, sprinkling the purifying waters is not an act that is necessary to facilitate a mitzva and does not override Shabbat even according to Rabbi Eliezer.", 
            "<b>Rav Adda bar Abba said to</b><b> Rava: If </b>it is <b>so, </b>that one may slaughter the Paschal lamb for someone who is ritually impure from a creeping animal, <b>it turns out that the Paschal lamb </b><b>is slaughtered for </b>people <b>who cannot eat it, </b>and it is stated elsewhere that such a sacrifice is disqualified.

            "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva stated a</b><b> principle </b>that any prohibited labor required for the offering of the sacrifice that can be performed before Shabbat does not override Shabbat; whereas slaughter, which cannot be performed on the eve of Shabbat, overrides Shabbat.<b>Rav Yehuda said that</b><b> Rav said: The </b><b><i>halakha</i></b><b> is in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva </b>with regard to the Paschal lamb.

            "The Gemara asks: If there is no obligation to bring this offering, <b>what is the reason that it nevertheless comes </b>when each person’s portion of the Paschal lamb is <b>small</b><b>? </b>The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>as it was</b><b> taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Festival peace-</b><b>offering</b><b> that comes</b><b> with the Paschal lamb is eaten first</b><b>;</b> the reason for this is <b>so that the Paschal lamb will be</b><b> eaten when </b>one is already <b>satiated</b><b>.</b> The Paschal lamb should not be eaten in a needy manner, but rather in joy and when one is already filled to satisfaction.

            "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come </b>and <b>hear </b>a solution from what was taught in a mishna: In the time of the Temple, one of the questions that the children would ask on the night of Passover was: How is this night different from all other nights? For on all other nights we eat meat that is roasted, stewed, or boiled, whereas <b>on this night it </b><b>is all roasted. And Rav Ḥisda said: This is the </b><b>statement of ben Teima, </b>indicating that even the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth must be roasted.

            "Another <b>dilemma was raised before </b>the Sages: <b>According to </b>the opinion of <b>ben Teima, does </b>the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth <b>come from the herd or does it </b><b>not come from the herd, </b>like the Paschal offering, which must be brought from the flock? <b>Does it come </b>even <b>from females or does it not come from females, </b>just like the Paschal offering comes only from males? <b>Does it</b><b> come </b>even from <b>a</b> <b>two-year-old </b>animal <b>or does</b><b> it not come </b>from <b>a two-year-old </b>animal, but rather only from a one-year-old animal, like the Paschal offering itself?", 
            "The Gemara explains that this dilemma is based on a fundamental question similar to the one raised earlier: <b>When the Merciful One</b><b> compares </b>the Festival peace-offering <b>to the Paschal lamb </b>in the Torah, was that only <b>with regard to matters </b>pertaining to <b>eating </b>and the time during which the Paschal lamb must be eaten, <b>but for everything </b>else there is <b>no </b>comparison? <b>Or perhaps there is no difference </b>and the Torah compared these two offerings in every way.",

            "Yet another <b>dilemma was raised before </b>the Sages: <b>According to </b>the opinion of <b>ben Teima, is </b>the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth <b>subject to </b>the prohibition against <b>breaking a bone, </b>as is the Paschal lamb, with regard to which the Torah explicitly states: “And you shall not break a bone in it” (Exodus 12:46), <b>or is it </b><b>not subject to </b>the prohibition against <b>breaking a bone? </b>The possible considerations are as follows: Do we say that <b>even </b><b>though the Merciful One compares </b>the Festival peace-offering <b>to </b><b>the Paschal lamb, the verse </b>that teaches the prohibition against breaking a bone <b>says “in it,” </b>and these words serve as a qualifying statement, indicating that the prohibition applies only <b>in it, </b>the Paschal lamb, <b>and not in the Festival</b><b> peace-</b><b>offering</b> that comes with it? <b>Or perhaps this </b>term, <b>“in it,” </b>teaches that the prohibition applies only <b>to</b><b> a fit </b>Paschal lamb <b>but not to a disqualified </b>one.", 
            "The Gemara proposes: <b>Come </b>and <b>hear </b>a solution based on the following mishna: If <b>a </b>slaughtering <b>knife was foun</b><b>d</b><b> on the fourteent</b><b>h</b> day of Nisan in Jerusalem, <b>one</b><b> may slaughter with it immediately </b>without concern that perhaps it is ritually impure, for presumably any knife that is valid for slaughtering had already been immersed on the previous day so that it could be used for slaughtering the Paschal lamb.

            "The Gemara clarifies: <b>Whose </b>opinion is taught in this mishna? <b>If you</b><b> say it is </b>the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, </b>who permit breaking the bones of the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth, <b>what is different </b>about a slaughtering <b>knife </b>found on the fourteenth <b>that </b>we say its owner presumably <b>immersed </b>it on the previous day?

            "<b>Rather, is it</b><b> not </b>the opinion of <b>ben Teima, and learn from this</b> that even the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth <b>is</b><b> subject to </b>the prohibition against <b>breaking a bone, </b>and therefore a cleaver must be immersed again even if it was found on the fourteenth. Since no bones may be broken on the fourteenth of Nisan, neither those of the Paschal lamb nor those of the Festival peace-offering, it is possible that the knife was not immersed in preparation for the Festival. ", 
            "The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No, actually</b> one can explain that the mishna reflects the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and </b>it is referring to a case <b>where </b>the time to slaughter the Paschal lamb <b>comes on </b><b>Shabbat. </b>In this circumstance, all agree that the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth is not sacrificed.

            "<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to </b>Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Let</b><b> the communal offerings,</b> such as the daily offering and the additional-offerings of Shabbat and the Festivals, <b>prove </b>the matter, <b>for they are permitted </b>to be slaughtered on Shabbat <b>for their own purpose, and </b>nevertheless, <b>one who </b>unnecessarily <b>slaughters </b>a different offering <b>for their purpose is liable</b><b>.</b>This indicates that even when a particular offering may be slaughtered, one is nevertheless liable if he slaughtered a different offering for the purpose of the permitted offering. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua </b><b>said to him: No, if you say </b>this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>communal offerings, </b>it is <b>because they have a </b><b>limit, </b>as there is a specific number of communal offerings that must be offered on any particular day and there is no reason one would mistakenly sacrifice extra offerings for this purpose.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> When the mishna speaks of one who slaughtered a Paschal lamb on Shabbat for a different purpose, <b>with what </b>precisely <b>are we dealing? If </b><b>you say </b>we are dealing <b>with one who erred </b>in that he actually thought this was a different offering and not a Paschal offering, <b>learn from it, </b>i.e., from the fact that the offering is disqualified and he is therefore liable to bring a sin-offering, that <b>the erroneous </b><b>uprooting </b>of the status of an offering <b>constitutes uprooting, </b>even though he had no intention to do so. It would, however, be surprising to find the mishna taking a stand on this issue, as we find elsewhere that it is the subject of an amoraic dispute (<i>Tosafot</i>). <b>Rather, </b>the mishna must certainly be referring to <b>one who </b>intentionally <b>uprooted </b>the animal’s designation as a Paschal lamb and offered it as a different offering.", 
            "If so, <b>say the latter clause </b>of the mishna: As for <b>all </b><b>other offerings that one </b>unwittingly <b>slaughtered </b>on Shabbat <b>for the </b><b>purpose of a Paschal offering, if they were not fit </b>for the Paschal offering, <b>he is liable </b>to bring a sin-offering. <b>And if they are fit, Rabbi Eliezer deems </b>him <b>liable </b>to bring <b>a sin-</b><b>offering</b><b>, </b>whereas <b>Rabbi Yehoshua </b><b>exempts </b>him. <b>Now if </b>the mishna is referring to one who intentionally <b>uprooted </b>the original designation of the animal, which he knew was not a Paschal offering, <b>what does it</b><b> matter to me whether </b>the animal was <b>fit or unfit</b><b>? </b>He certainly does not think that he is performing a mitzva; why then does Rabbi Yehoshua exempt him from bringing a sin-offering?", 
            "<b>Rather, it is obvious </b>that we must be dealing with <b>one who erred. </b>But if so, we have a contradiction in the mishna, as <b>the</b><b> first clause </b>is referring to <b>one who </b>intentionally <b>uprooted </b>the animal’s designation, <b>whereas the latter clause </b>is referring to <b>one who erred </b>about it. <b>Rabbi Avin said: Yes, </b>we must accept this conclusion even though it is unusual: <b>The</b><b> first clause </b>deals with <b>one who uprooted </b>the animal’s designation, <b>whereas the latter clause </b>deals with <b>one who erred</b> about it.", 
            "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef </b>once <b>found Rabbi Abbahu</b><b> standing among a multitude [</b><b><i>okhlosa</i></b><b>]</b><b> of people, </b>and <b>he</b><b> said to him: What is </b>the meaning of <b>our mishna</b><b>? </b>Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: The first clause </b>is referring to <b>one who </b>intentionally <b>uprooted </b>the animal’s status, <b>whereas</b><b> the latter clause </b>is referring to <b>one who erred </b>about it. Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef <b>learned </b>this statement <b>from </b><b>him forty times</b><b>,</b><b> and it seemed to him as </b><b>though it were resting in his pouch; </b>i.e., he repeated it many times until the mishna became crystal clear to him and etched in his memory. ", 
            "The Gemara raises a difficulty with this understanding of the mishna: <b>We learned </b>in the continuation of the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said </b>to Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>If </b>with regard to <b>the Paschal lamb, which is permitted </b>to be slaughtered on Shabbat <b>for its own purpose, when one </b><b>changed its purpose he is </b>nevertheless <b>liable, </b>then with regard to other <b>offerings that are forbidden </b>to be slaughtered on Shabbat even <b>for their own purpose, when he changed their </b><b>purpose is it not right that he should be liable? </b><b>And if it is so </b>that the two parts of the mishna are not talking about the same case, <b>surely </b><b>they are not similar </b>and cannot be compared; <b>as the </b><b>first clause </b>is referring to <b>one who </b>intentionally <b>uprooted </b>the animal’s status, <b>whereas the latter clause </b>is referring to <b>one who erred </b>about it. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>According to Rabbi </b><b>Eliezer, </b>who put forward this <i>a</i> <i>fortiori</i> argument, <b>there is</b><b> no difference</b><b>,</b> for in his opinion someone who erred while intending to perform a mitzva is liable to bring a sin-offering, even if he made a reasonable mistake. Thus, he does not differentiate between the deliberate uprooting of the animal’s status and the erroneous sacrificing of the offering for a different purpose. The Gemara asks: But <b>according to Rabbi Yehoshua, for whom there is a difference </b>between the two cases, <b>let him answer </b>Rabbi Eliezer in <b>this </b>way, that the first clause of the mishna is referring to one who intentionally uprooted the status of an offering, while the latter clause is referring to one who erred about it. Why does he introduce another factor, that in the first clause he changed the animal’s purpose for something forbidden, whereas in the latter clause he changed it for something permitted? ", 
            "The Gemara explains that <b>this </b><b>is what </b>Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to </b>Rabbi Eliezer: <b>According to </b><b>me, </b>these cases are <b>not comparable, </b>because <b>the first clause </b>deals <b>with one who </b>intentionally <b>uprooted </b>the animal’s designation, <b>whereas the latter clause </b>deals <b>with one who erred </b>about it. However, even <b>according to you, </b>who do not differentiate in this manner, I can still answer as follows: <b>No</b><b>, if you say </b>that one is liable if he slaughtered <b>a Paschal lamb </b>for a different purpose, it is <b>because</b><b> he changed its purpose for something prohibited. </b>But can <b>you</b><b> say </b>the same thing <b>about </b>other <b>offerings that he </b>slaughtered for the purpose of a Paschal offering and thus <b>changed</b><b> their purpose for something permitted?</b>", 
            "The mishna continues with what <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to </b>Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>Let the communal offerings prove </b>the matter, <b>for they are </b><b>permitted </b>for slaughter on Shabbat <b>for their own purpose, and </b>nevertheless, <b>one who </b>unnecessarily <b>slaughters </b>different offerings <b>for their purpose </b><b>is liable. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: No, if you </b><b>said </b>this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>communal offerings, </b>it is <b>because they have a limit. </b>But can <b>you </b>necessarily <b>say </b>the same thing with <b>regard to the Paschal lamb, which </b><b>does not have a limit?</b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that wherever there </b><b>is a limit, Rabbi Yehoshua deems liable </b>one who erred while intending to perform a mitzva? <b>But </b>with regard to the circumcision of <b>babies </b>on Shabbat, <b>which has a limit</b><b>,</b><b> we </b>nevertheless <b>learned </b>in a mishna that with regard to <b>one who had two babies </b>to circumcise, <b>one </b>of whom he needed <b>to circumcise after Shabbat and one </b>of whom he needed <b>to circumcise on Shabbat, and he forgot </b><b>and circumcised </b>the one that should have been circumcised <b>after </b><b>Shabbat on Shabbat, he is liable </b>to bring a sin-offering. This is because he performed the prohibited labor of causing a wound not in the framework of performing a mitzva, as no obligation yet existed to circumcise the child.", 
            "If, however, there were two babies, <b>one </b>of whom he needed <b>to circumcise on Shabbat eve, and one </b>of whom he needed <b>to circumcise on Shabbat, and he </b><b>forgot and circumcised the one </b>that he should have circumcised on <b>Shabbat eve on Shabbat, Rabbi Eliezer deems </b>him <b>liable </b><b>to </b>bring <b>a sin-</b><b>offering</b><b>. </b>As circumcision after its appointed time does not override Shabbat, he has therefore unwittingly violated Shabbat. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua exempts </b>him. Since he intended to perform a mitzva, and despite his error in fact performed a mitzva, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. Thus, we see that even though there is a limit in the case of the babies, Rabbi Yehoshua nevertheless exempts one who errs while intending to perform a mitzva. ", 
            "<b>Rabbi </b><b>Ami said: With what are we dealing here? </b>We are dealing with a case <b>where </b>the circumciser <b>first </b>unwittingly <b>circumcised </b>the baby who should have been circumcised on <b>Shabbat eve </b><b>on Shabbat, </b>when <b>there is </b>still <b>this </b>other baby who should be circumcised on <b>Shabbat with whom he is preoccupied. </b>Since he was legitimately preoccupied with a mitzva, as he knew that there was a baby that needed to be circumcised, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. <b>Here, </b>however, with regard to offerings, we are dealing with a case <b>where he first slaughtered the </b>required <b>communal offerings at </b><b>the beginning, </b>so that there was no need to slaughter any more offerings, as communal offerings have a limit. Since he had no reason to make a mistake, he is liable to bring a sin-offering for having unnecessarily slaughtered an animal on Shabbat. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, </b>how do we understand the continuation of the mishna, where <b>Rabbi Meir says </b>that according to Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>even one who </b>unwittingly <b>slaughters </b>other offerings <b>for </b><b>the purpose of communal offerings </b>beyond their daily limit <b>is </b><b>exempt? </b>According to our explanation, this must be true <b>even </b><b>though he first slaughtered the </b>required <b>communal offerings at the </b><b>beginning. But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya from </b>the village of <b>Avel Ara</b><b>v</b><b> teach </b>in a <i>baraita</i> another version of the dispute, according to which <b>Rabbi Meir said: Rabbi Eliezer and</b><b> Rabbi Yehoshua did not disagree over one who had two</b><b> babies </b>to circumcise, <b>one to circumcise </b>on <b>Shabbat eve and</b><b> one to circumcise on Shabbat, and he forgot and circumcised</b><b> the </b>one who should have been circumcised on <b>Shabbat eve</b><b> on Shabbat; </b>in that case, everyone agrees <b>that he is</b><b> liable </b>to bring a sin-offering.",

", 
            "The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>And </b>how can <b>you understan</b><b>d</b> this <i>baraita</i> in its current formulation? <b>If there, </b>in the latter clause, where he circumcised the baby who should have been circumcised after Shabbat on Shabbat, so that <b>he did </b><b>not perform a mitzva </b>because the baby was not yet eight days old and the mitzva did not yet apply, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua </b>nevertheless <b>exempted </b>him because he erred while intending to perform a mitzva. Then <b>where he did perform a </b><b>mitzva, </b>i.e., where he circumcised a baby on Shabbat who was already eight days old before Shabbat and to whom the mitzva of circumcision applied, would Rabbi Yehoshua <b>deem </b><b>him liable?</b>", 
            "The Rabbis of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said: The </b><b>first clause </b>of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a unique situation, <b>where </b>the circumciser <b>first </b>unwittingly <b>circumcised on Shabbat eve </b>the baby who should have been circumcised on <b>Shabbat. </b>"
        ], 
        [
            "In that case, <b>Shabbat does not stand to be overridden </b>at all. Since the baby who should have been circumcised on Shabbat was already circumcised, and the only one left is the baby who should have been circumcised on Friday, the circumciser should have known that he has no circumcisions to perform on Shabbat, because a circumcision that was delayed beyond the eighth day does not override Shabbat. Therefore, he is liable if he performed the circumcision on Shabbat. In <b>the latter clause, </b>however, the circumcision was performed in a situation where <b>Shabbat </b><b>stands to be overridden for him, </b>as the baby who should have been circumcised on Shabbat was not yet circumcised.", 
            "Based on the understanding that everything depends on whether or not Shabbat stands to be overridden, it may be argued that <b>here </b>too, <b>Shabbat stands to be overridden with regard to a </b><b>communal offering. </b>Therefore, one who on Shabbat unwittingly slaughters other offerings for the purpose of communal offerings is exempt from bringing a sin-offering, because he knows that communal offerings must be brought on Shabbat, and consequently there is some justification for his error.", 
            "<b>Rav</b><b> Ashi said to Rav Kahana </b>that this explanation is difficult: <b>Here too, </b>it may be argued that <b>Shabbat stands to</b><b> be overridden with regard to babies in general, </b>as it is permitted to circumcise a baby whose eighth day occurs on Shabbat, and so there is some minimal justification for his mistake. Rav Kahana <b>said to him: </b>That is indeed so. <b>However, with regard to this person, </b>Shabbat <b>does </b><b>not stand </b>to be overridden, as there is no longer any child who is supposed to be circumcised on Shabbat.

            "We learned in the mishna with regard to <b>all other offerings that one </b>unwittingly <b>slaughtered </b>on Shabbat <b>for</b><b> the purpose of a Paschal offering, </b>that <b>if they were</b><b> not fit </b>for the Paschal offering, <b>he is liable </b>to bring a sin-offering, <b>and if they were fit, </b><b>Rabbi Eliezer deems </b>him <b>liable </b>to bring <b>a sin-</b><b>offering</b><b>, </b><b>and Rabbi Yehoshua exempts </b>him.

            "<b>Rava raised a dilemma before </b>Rav Naḥman: If one unwittingly slaughtered an <b>unconsecrated </b>animal <b>for the purpose of a Paschal</b><b> offering, what would Rabbi Meir say? </b>Would he exempt him in this case as well?

            "Rava asked him: <b>But didn’t Rabbi</b><b> Yoḥanan say </b>that <b>Rabbi Meir concedes </b>that if one slaughtered <b>blemished </b>animals on Shabbat he is liable to bring a sin-offering, as they are never sacrificed as offerings, and similarly, unconsecrated animals are never sacrificed as offerings? Rav Naḥman responded: There is room for a distinction. <b>Blemished </b>animals <b>cannot</b><b> be confused </b>with unblemished ones, and so there is no legitimate reason for error; but <b>these, </b>i.e., unconsecrated animals, <b>can </b>easily <b>be confused </b>with consecrated animals, as they are externally indistinguishable from one another, and therefore one who confuses them is exempt.", 
            "Rava asked further: <b>And is Rabbi Meir’s reason </b>really <b>that these can be confused and these cannot be confused</b> with a legitimate offering? <b>But didn’t Rav Beivai say</b><b> that Rabbi Elazar said </b>that <b>Rabbi Meir would exempt </b>him <b>even </b>in the case of <b>a calf of a peace</b><b>-</b><b>offering</b><b> that he slaughtered for the purpose of the Paschal</b><b> offering, </b>even though there is no way to mistake a calf for an animal that can be brought for the Paschal offering?

But why should one be exempt if he brought an unconsecrated animal for the purpose of a Paschal offering? He is not preoccupied with bringing it as an offering. ", 
            "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: </b>Both reasons apply according to Rabbi Meir. If one is <b>preoccupied </b>with bringing the animal as an offering, he is exempt <b>even</b><b> though </b>the animal <b>cannot </b>easily <b>be confused </b>with the one he was supposed to sacrifice.

            "The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Zeira and </b><b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak were sitting on the porch </b><b>of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, and they sat and </b><b>said: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: If one </b>unwittingly <b>confused</b><b> a spit of leftover </b>sacrificial meat, which it is prohibited to eat and which makes one liable to receive the punishment of <i>karet</i> when one eats it intentionally, <b>with a</b><b> spit of roasted </b>sacrificial meat, which is a mitzva to eat, <b>and he ate it, he is liable </b>to bring a sin-offering. Although he intended to do a mitzva, since he unwittingly transgressed the prohibition against eating leftover sacrificial meat, he must bring a sin-offering. ", 
            "<b>And </b>they further reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </b>If <b>one </b>unwittingly <b>engaged in</b><b> sexual intercourse with his wife while she was menstruating, he</b><b> is liable </b>to bring a sin-offering. But if <b>he</b> unwittingly <b>engaged in sexual intercourse with his sister-in-law</b><b> who was waiting </b>to become his wife through <b>levirate marriage</b><b> while she was menstruating, he is exempt, </b>because the act of intercourse itself is a mitzva. A man whose brother died without children is obliged by Torah law to marry his deceased widow and “come to her” (Deuteronomy 25:5), so that even if he mistakenly transgressed while attempting to fulfill the mitzva, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering.", 
            "The Gemara attempts to determine whether Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees or disagrees with Reish Lakish’s ruling: <b>Some say </b>that <b>all the more so in the </b>first case, where one unwittingly ate a spit of leftover sacrificial meat, Rabbi Yoḥanan would <b>deem </b>him <b>liable </b>to bring a sin-offering, <b>for he did not </b>actually <b>perform a mitzva</b> when he ate the meat, even though he intended to do so.

            "The Gemara asks further: Even so, <b>didn’t Rava say </b>that <b>a man is obligated </b><b>to please his wife through a mitzva</b><b>?</b> That is to say, he must engage in sexual intercourse with her when she so desires, even if it is not the time of her conjugal rights. The Gemara answers that we are dealing with a case where it was <b>near her </b><b>expected date </b>of menstruation, when sexual relations are prohibited due to a concern that the woman may already be menstruating or that she may begin to menstruate during the sexual act.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, </b>i.e., if they engaged in sexual intercourse near the woman’s expected date of menstruation when he should have refrained from doing so, then <b>even </b>in the case where he had sexual intercourse with <b>his sister-in-law </b>and she turned out to be menstruating, he should <b>also </b>be liable, as the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply at that time. The Gemara explains that with regard to <b>his sister-in-law,</b><b> he is </b>still <b>shy [</b><b><i>bazeiz</i></b><b>]</b> in front <b>of he</b><b>r</b> and uncomfortable asking her whether she is close to her expected menstruation date, whereas with regard to <b>his wife, </b><b>he is not shy </b>in front <b>of her, </b>and so he should have asked her.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, </b><b>in accordance with whose </b>opinion did he rule with regard to one who erred while engaged in a mitzva? <b>If </b><b>you say </b>he ruled <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as we learned </b>in a mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei </b><b>says: </b>If <b>the first Festival day of the festival </b>of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>occurs on Shabbat, and he forgot and carried </b>his <b><i>lula</i></b><b><i>v</i></b> <b>out into the public domain </b>and continued to transport it there, unwittingly performing a prohibited labor, <b>he is exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering.

            "There is room to differentiate between Rabbi Yosei’s ruling and that of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Perhaps it is different there, as he is</b><b> pressed for time. </b>Since by Torah law the mitzva of <i>lulav</i> applies only one day a year, he is anxious to fulfill the mitzva and therefore does not realize that he is violating a Torah prohibition. This is unlike the case of levirate marriage, which need not be performed at any specific time and about which he is less pressured.", 
            "<b>Rather, </b>one might say that Rabbi Yoḥanan issued his ruling in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b><b> Yehoshua </b>in our mishna <b>with regard to offerings, </b>for according to Rabbi Yehoshua, one who unwittingly slaughtered another offering on Shabbat for the purpose of a Paschal offering, and the animal was fit to be brought as a Paschal offering, is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. Here too, however, there is room to differentiate. <b>Perhaps there also </b>we can say that Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him because <b>he is </b><b>pressed for time.</b>", 
            "<b>Rather, </b>one might say that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling is <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b><b>Yehoshua with regard to babies, </b>one that should have been circumcised on Shabbat eve and the other on Shabbat, and the circumciser forgot and circumcised the one that should have been circumcised on Shabbat eve on Shabbat. In that case the circumciser is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. But once again there is room to differentiate: Perhaps <b>there too, </b>Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him because <b>he is pressed for time.</b> ", 
            "<b>Rather, </b>we should say that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling is <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b><b> with regard to </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b>, as we learned </b>in a mishna: If a priest <b>was eating </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b>,</b><b> and it became</b><b> known that he was the son of a divorced woman</b><b> or a woman who underwent </b><b><i>ḥalitza</i></b> and he is therefore disqualified from the priesthood and may not eat <i>teruma</i>, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems </b>him <b>liable </b>to pay <b>the </b>value of the <b>principal and </b>an additional <b>fifth, </b>like any non-priest who unwittingly ate <i>teruma</i>, whereas <b>Rabbi Yehoshua exempts </b>him. In this case, one who thought he was a priest and therefore fulfilling a mitzva when he ate the <i>teruma</i> was actually committing a transgression, but nevertheless, Rabbi Yehoshua exempts him from the ordinary penalty. On the face of it, this is similar to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling.", 
            "This comparison can, however, be rejected, for <b>perhaps </b>that case should be explained <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye. For Rav Beivai bar Abaye said</b><b>: </b>The mishna is talking about a disqualified priest who ate <b><i>teruma</i></b> which is leaven <b>on the eve of Passover, whose</b><b> time is pressing, </b>because if he does not eat it quickly he will have to burn it. ", 
            "<b>Alternatively, </b>there may be another reason to differentiate: Eating <b><i>teruma</i></b><b> is different, because it is called </b>sacred <b>service</b><b>, and the Merciful One validates service </b>performed by someone of priestly descent even if he is not fit for the priesthood.", 
            "<b>As we learned </b>in a mishna: If a priest <b>was</b><b> standing and sacrificing offerings </b>on the altar, <b>and it became</b><b> known that he was the son of a divorced woman</b><b> or the son of a woman who underwent </b><b><i>ḥalitza</i></b><b>, </b><b>all the offerings that he offered on the altar </b>until that time <b>are disqualified, </b>because only service performed by a priest deemed fit is acceptable. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua validates </b>them. <b>And we said: What is the reason of Rabbi </b><b>Yehoshua?

            "The Gemara questions what was stated above: <b>And where is </b><b><i>teruma</i></b><b> called service? </b>The Gemara explains: <b>As it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an </b><b>incident involving Rabbi Tarfon, who did not come in the </b><b>evening to the study hall.

            "We learned in our mishna that if <b>one </b>unwittingly <b>slaughtered </b>the Paschal lamb on Shabbat <b>for those </b><b>who cannot eat it </b>or for those who did not register for it, he is liable to bring a sin-offering.

The Gemara answers: <b>Since the </b><b>latter clause </b>of the mishna <b>taught </b>cases in which he is <b>exempt </b>from bringing a sin-offering, <b>the first clause </b><b>taught </b>cases in which he is <b>liable, </b>even though it does not really teach us anything new.",

The <i>halakha</i> there is also obvious. The Gemara answers: <b>Since </b>the mishna <b>wished </b>to teach <b>the dispute </b>between <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, </b>it taught all these other <i>halakhot</i> as well. ", 
            "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna</b><b> bar Ḥinnana said to his son: When you go before</b><b> Rabbi Zerika, ask him: According to the opinion that says</b><b> that one who inflicts a destructive wound is exempt, </b>i.e., that one who causes a wound on Shabbat that has no constructive effect but rather is purely destructive in nature has not performed a prohibited labor and is therefore exempt from bringing a sin-offering, how are we to understand the mishna’s ruling that <b>one who slaughtered </b>the Paschal lamb <b>for those who cannot eat it is liable</b><b>? </b>Since the slaughter is invalid, he should be seen as having wounded the animal in a way that brings no benefit and is simply destructive. <b>What has he improve</b><b>d</b> through the slaughter that he should be liable for having performed a prohibited labor? ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>He has improved </b>it in that <b>if </b>the sacrificial parts of the offering <b>ascended </b>to the top of the altar, <b>they do not descend. </b>The <i>halakha</i> is that if the sacrificial parts of a disqualified offering are inadvertently brought up to the top of the altar, they need not be removed and they may be burned on the altar. Thus, the slaughter had some constructive effect.",

            "We learned in the next clause of our mishna that if one <b>slaughtered </b>the Paschal lamb <b>and it was found to </b><b>have a hidden condition that would cause it to die </b><b>within twelve months [</b><b><i>tereifa</i></b><b>], he is exempt </b>from bringing a sin-offering. The mishna’s wording indicates that <b>if </b>the animal’s condition <b>is visible, </b>its owner <b>is liable</b><b>.</b>It may be asked: <b>What has he improved </b>by slaughtering an animal with a such a condition? The Gemara answers: <b>He has improved </b>it in that he <b>removed it from </b>the category of <b>an animal carcass [</b><b><i>neveila</i></b><b>], </b>i.e., an animal that died of natural causes or as the result of an improperly carried out act of ritual slaughter. Had the animal died on its own it would have been treated as a <i>neveila</i>, which is a primary source of ritual impurity, rendering those who touch or carry it ritually impure.

Therefore, it would seem that the slaughter served no constructive purpose.", 
            "<b>Rav Avira said: </b>Even here he has improved it in that <b>he removed it from </b>the category of <b>limbs from a living creature</b><b>.</b> Even a gentile is liable if he eats meat taken from a living animal, but once the animal is slaughtered there is no longer any liability. Accordingly, even this act of slaughter has achieved a productive result.", 
            "We learned in the mishna that if <b>one </b><b>slaughtered </b>the Paschal lamb <b>and it became known </b>afterward that the owners had died, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering. <b>Rav Huna said that Rav said: </b>Regarding <b>a </b><b>guilt-</b><b>offering</b><b> that was consigned to grazing: </b>If the owner of a guilt-offering dies or achieves atonement through a different guilt-offering, the animal is sent out to graze in the field until it develops a blemish, at which point it can be sold. The money from the sale is used to purchase a burnt-offering. <b>And </b>if, before it developed a blemish, someone <b>slaughtered it without specifying </b>its purpose, <b>it is valid as a burnt-</b><b>offering</b><b>. </b>The Gemara concludes that Rav <b>apparently holds that it does not require </b><b>uprooting. </b>There is no need for an explicit declaration in order to change the status of the offering; even if it is slaughtered without its purpose specified it is valid.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, </b>even <b>when it has not </b>yet <b>been </b><b>consigned </b>to grazing, it should <b>also </b>be valid, for any guilt-offering whose owner has achieved atonement through a different offering is presumably going to be brought as a free-will burnt-offering. The Gemara answers: This invalidation stems from a rabbinic <b>decree </b>with regard to a guilt-offering <b>after </b>its owner achieved <b>atonement </b>with a different offering <b>due to </b>concern about a guilt-offering <b>before </b>its owner achieved <b>atonement </b>with a different offering. Before the owner achieves atonement the animal is certainly considered a guilt-offering; it is only after the owner achieves atonement that the offering becomes valid for use as a burnt-offering, and then by strict <i>halakha</i> it is immediately valid for that purpose, even before the animal develops a blemish. ", 
            "<b>From where do you </b><b>say </b>that this is the case? <b>As we learned </b>elsewhere in a mishna: <b>A guilt-</b><b>offering</b><b> whose owner has died </b><b>or whose owner has achieved atonemen</b><b>t</b> through a different guilt-offering <b>grazes until it becomes unfit, </b>whereupon <b>it is sold</b><b> and its money is used for a </b>communal <b>free-will</b><b> burnt-</b><b>offering</b><b>. Rabbi Eliezer says: </b>This guilt-offering is made to <b>die </b>on its own. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: </b>When it develops a blemish, <b>it is sold, and he </b><b>brings a burnt-</b><b>offering</b> for himself <b>with its money.</b>", 
            "This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehoshua, as soon as the owner achieves atonement, his animal loses its status as a guilt-offering and it becomes a burnt-offering. Nevertheless, even he says that the animal that is bought <b>with its money </b>may <b>indeed </b>be brought as a burnt-offering, <b>but </b>the guilt-offering <b>itself </b>must <b>not </b>be sacrificed as a burnt-offering. Undoubtedly, his reason must be that the Sages issued <b>a decree </b>with regard to a guilt-offering <b>after </b>its owner achieved <b>atonement </b>with a different offering, <b>due to </b>concern about a guilt-offering <b>before </b>its owner achieved <b>atonement </b>with a different offering.

            "<b>Rav Ḥisda raised an </b><b>objection to Rav Huna </b>with regard to his opinion about uprooting the status of an offering from what we learned in our mishna: If <b>one slaughtered </b>a Paschal lamb on Shabbat <b>and </b>afterward <b>it became known that the owners had </b><b>withdrawn </b>from it and registered for a different one, or that they had died or become ritually impure, he is exempt from bringing a sin-offering, because he slaughtered with permission.

            "<b>And it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to this </b>mishna that <b>on a weekday, in a case like this, </b>where it turns out that there is no one to eat the Paschal offering, <b>it should be burned immediately</b><b>.</b> <b>Granted, if you say </b>that an offering that has no owner <b>requires uprooting </b>from its previous status in order for its status to change and in the absence of explicit uprooting it retains its original status, here too it can be argued that <b>this is </b>still <b>a Paschal offering.

            "The Gemara infers from this that <b>it is </b>only <b>this </b>offering that <b>requires </b>explicit <b>uprooting, </b>because it is reasonable to assume that its owners still intend to use it for its original purpose, <b>but </b><b>in general it does not require uprooting. </b>According to this opinion, <b>what is there to say, </b>as it would seem that our mishna indicates that explicit uprooting is necessary?

            "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>From where </b>is this known to be correct? <b>Perhaps </b>it requires uprooting and the disqualification is inherent.

            "It was taught in the mishna that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <b>one places the legs</b> and entrails inside the lamb’s body and roasts them together. <b>It was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael </b>would <b>call </b>the Paschal lamb: <b><i>Tokh</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>tokh</i></b><b>,</b> because when one roasts the legs and entrails inside the lamb they make that sound, like other things that are cooked. <b>Rabbi </b><b>Tarfon </b>would <b>call it: Helmeted kid. </b>In his opinion, the entrails must be roasted when they are suspended from the spit above the head of the animal, somewhat resembling a helmet.

            "The Gemara raises another discussion with regard to blood absorbed in meat. People would soak raw meat (<i>Tosafot</i>) in vinegar in order to ensure that none of the blood would separate from its original place and prohibit the meat from being eaten, as it is permitted to eat blood that has not separated from its original place. <b>This </b>piece of <b>raw</b><b> meat, whose vinegar became re</b><b>d</b> due to the blood absorbed in it, <b>is forbidden. </b>If <b>its vinegar did not </b><b>become red, it is permitted.

            "It was taught in the mishna that <b>one </b>may <b>not roast the Paschal lamb </b>on a grill. Subsequently, the mishna quotes an incident in which Rabban Gamliel instructed his servant to roast the Paschal lamb for him on a grill. The Gemara expresses surprise: Was <b>an incident </b>cited <b>to contradict </b>what was previously stated? The Gemara responds: The mishna <b>is incomplet</b><b>e</b><b> and is teaching the</b><b> following: And if it is a perforated grill, </b>so that the fire reaches each part of the meat and the animal will not be roasted from the heat of the grill itself, <b>it is permitted.

            "The Gemara cites a discussion related to the subject of roasting the Paschal lamb. <b>Rav Ḥinnana</b><b> bar Idi raised a dilemma before Rav Adda bar Ahava</b><b>: </b>In the case of <b>an oven that one fired with</b><b> peels of </b>fruit that are <b><i>orla</i></b><b>,</b> i.e., fruit that grows on a tree the first three years after it was planted, from which one may not receive any benefit, if, after the oven became very hot, <b>he swept</b><b> it </b>and removed the fuel and the ashes, <b>and he</b><b> baked bread in it, according to the opinion that prohibits</b> bread baked directly with heat from <i>orla</i> fuel, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to this bread? It was baked with the heat trapped in the oven only after the fuel was removed. <b>He said to him: The bread is</b><b> permitted. </b>", 
            "Rav Ḥinnana <b>said to him: </b><b>But didn’t Rav Ḥinnana the Elder say </b>that <b>Rabbi </b><b>Asi said </b>that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </b>If there is <b>an </b><b>oven that one fired and swept </b>so that the heat remains but there is no longer any fire in the oven, <b>and </b>one then <b>roasted the Paschal lamb in it</b><b>,</b><b> this is not </b>a fulfillment of the Torah’s command that the Paschal lamb must be <b>roasted in fire</b><b>, as it is stated </b>in the Torah: “And they shall eat the meat on that night, <b>roasted in fire, </b>and <i>matzot</i>; with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Do not eat of it raw, nor boiled in water, but <b>roasted in fire; </b>its head with its legs and with its inner parts” (Exodus 12:8–9), and since it says the phrase: Roasted in fire, <b>two times, </b>the verse emphasizes that the Paschal lamb must literally be roasted on the fire? ", 
            "The following can now be inferred: <b>The reason </b>is specifically because <b>the Merciful</b><b> One reveals </b>this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the Paschal lamb in the Torah by repeating: <b>Roasted in fire, roasted in</b><b> fire, twice. But </b>if <b>the Merciful One had not revealed</b> this <i>halakha</i> by emphasizing the need to roast it directly on the fire, <b>I would have said </b>a Paschal lamb roasted in an oven that has already been swept <b>is</b> nonetheless considered <b>roasted in fire. </b>Therefore, in other situations in which something is roasted in an oven, even if it is not roasted directly from the heat of a fire, its status should be comparable to something that was roasted directly from the fuel. If the fuel is forbidden, the food should be forbidden. ", 
            "Rav Adda bar Ahava <b>said to </b>Rav Ḥinnana bar Idi: <b>The Merciful One reveals it there, </b>with regard to the Paschal lamb, <b>and we learn from it </b>that even in other areas of <i>halakha</i>, only something that is roasted directly by a fire is considered roasted in fire. ", 
            "<b>And if </b><b>you wish, say </b>a different answer instead: <b>There, </b>in the case of the Paschal lamb, <b>the reason </b>one may not roast the lamb if one has already swept out the oven <b>is that the Merciful One writes “roasted in fire” twice</b><b>.

            "Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami <b>raised a contradiction </b>based on the Torah’s statement with regard to the laws of leprosy: “Or flesh that shall have on its skin <b>a burn from fire” </b>(Leviticus 13:24).

            "The Gemara responds: <b>It is</b><b> different there, as the verse states </b>not simply fire, but <b>“in fire she shall be burned.” </b>The expression <b>“she</b><b> shall be burned” </b>comes <b>to include all burnings that come</b><b> from fire. </b>",

            "Since the Gemara has discussed communal offerings that are brought even in a state of ritual impurity, it addresses the basic <i>halakhot</i> relating to this area. The Gemara posits two assumptions and then compares the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua to the mishna. It states as a preface that the Sages originally <b>assumed that</b><b> everyone agrees that ritual impurity is overridden in </b>cases involving <b>the public</b><b>.</b> In other words, the prohibition against sacrificing offerings in a state of ritual impurity applies to communal offerings, but it is superseded by the obligation to sacrifice the offering. Therefore, <b>the frontplate </b>of the High Priest <b>is</b><b> required to appease </b>God for the sacrifice of the offering in a state of ritual impurity. ", 
            "<b>There</b><b> is no </b><b><i>tanna</i></b><b> that you have heard </b>of <b>who said</b> that <b>ritual impurity </b>is entirely <b>permitted in </b>cases involving <b>the</b><b> public, </b>i.e., that with regard to the public there is no significance to ritual impurity in the Temple, <b>except for Rabbi Yehuda. As it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The frontplate </b>of the High Priest, <b>whether it is </b><b>on his forehead or whether it is not on his </b><b>forehead, appeases </b>God and thereby facilitates the acceptance of offerings sacrificed in a state of impurity; this is <b>the statement</b><b> of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says: </b>When <b>it is still</b><b> on his forehead it appeases </b>God, but when <b>it</b><b> is no longer on his forehead it does not appease</b> Him, as indicated in the verse: “And it shall be on Aaron’s forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the sacred things which the children of Israel shall hallow” (Exodus 28:38). ", 
            "<b>Rabbi Shimon said to </b>Rabbi Yehuda: <b>The </b><i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>High Priest on</b><b> Yom Kippu</b><b>r</b><b> shall prove </b>it, <b>as </b>the frontplate <b>is </b><b>not on his forehead, and it </b>nonetheless <b>appeases </b>God if communal offerings are brought in a state of ritual impurity. The High Priest spends part of Yom Kippur wearing only the four white garments instead of his usual golden vestments, which include the frontplate. ", 
            "Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him: </b><b>Set aside Yom Kippur, as ritual impurity </b>is wholly <b>permitted </b><b>in </b>cases involving <b>the public. </b>The frontplate is needed only to atone for individual offerings that are brought in a state of ritual impurity. This proves <b>by inference that Rabbi </b><b>Shimon holds </b>that <b>ritual impurity is overridden in </b>cases involving <b>the public, </b>but it is not wholly permitted. Therefore, the frontplate is needed to appease God for the sacrifice of the offering in a state of ritual impurity. ", 
            "The Sages also presumed that <b>everyone agrees </b>that <b>the frontplate </b>appeases God only for the sacrifice of the offering and the burning of the requisite parts on the altar in a state of ritual impurity, but it <b>does not appease </b>God <b>for </b>the impurity of the portions of offerings that are supposed to be <b>eaten</b><b>.</b> Therefore, although the offering is valid, it may not be eaten. <b>As, the only </b><b><i>tanna</i></b><b> you have</b><b> heard say the frontplate appeases </b>God <b>for </b>the impurity of the portions of offerings that are supposed to be <b>eaten</b><b> is Rabbi Eliezer, as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The frontplate appeases </b>God <b>for </b>the impurity of the portions of offerings that supposed to be <b>eaten. </b>And <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The frontplate does not appease</b> God <b>for </b>the impurity of portions of offerings that are supposed to be <b>eaten. </b>",

", 
            "The Gemara explains the question: It could <b>enter your mind </b>to say: <b>From </b>the fact <b>that Rabbi </b><b>Yosei said </b>that <b>the frontplate does not appease </b>God <b>for </b>the impurity of portions of offerings that are supposed to be <b>eaten, </b>it can be inferred that <b>he holds in</b><b> accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who said </b>that <b>we require </b>the <b>two </b>parts of the offering, the blood and the meat, to be valid. If this were not the case, it would be sufficient for the frontplate to appease God for the impurity of the blood, and it would not be necessary for the frontplate to appease God for the impurity of the portions of offerings that are supposed to be eaten. <b>Let us now say that the</b><b> mishna is not in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b><b> Yosei. </b>", 
            "The Gemara rejects this assertion: <b>No, Rabbi Yosei</b><b> holds in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who</b><b> said </b>that the <b>blood </b>of an offering is accepted <b>although</b><b> there is no meat. </b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, with regard to what </b><b><i>halakha</i></b> did Rabbi Yosei say that <b>the frontplate does not appease </b>God <b>for </b>the impurity of the portions of offerings that are supposed to be <b>eaten? </b>Even if it does not appease God for the impurity of these portions, the offering remains valid. The Gemara rejects the question: <b>And according to your</b><b> reasoning, </b>with regard to <b>Rabbi Elieze</b><b>r</b> himself, <b>who said </b>that <b>the frontplate appeases </b>God for the impurity of the portions that are supposed to be <b>eaten, since he said</b> that the <b>blood </b>may be sprinkled <b>although there is no</b><b> meat, with regard to what </b><b><i>halakha</i></b> did he make his other statement that <b>the frontplate appeases </b>God for the impurity of the portions of offerings that are supposed to be <b>eaten? </b>Clearly, whether the frontplate appeases God is significant for reasons other than ensuring that an offering is accepted. ", 
            "<b>Rather</b><b>, </b>the fact that <b>they disagree </b>about whether the frontplate appeases God for the impurity of the portions of offerings that are supposed to be eaten determines whether it is possible <b>to establish </b>the offering <b>as </b>one <b>disqualified due to improper</b><b> intent [</b><b><i>piggul</i></b><b>]</b><b> and </b>whether it is possible <b>to exclude</b> the offering <b>from </b>the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property</b><b>.</b> The dispute is to be understood in this light: <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds </b>that <b>the frontplate appeases </b>God <b>for </b>the impurity of the meat that is supposed to be eaten, <b>and it renders it like pure </b>meat that is not disqualified. Therefore, although the meat may not be eaten, it may be <b>established as </b><b><i>piggul</i></b><b>. </b>Similarly, because it is treated as though it were pure, the sprinkling of the blood of the offering <b>excludes </b>the meat <b>from </b>the prohibition of <b>misuse of consecrated property. </b>", 
            "<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b><b> holds </b>that <b>the frontplate does not appease God for </b>the impurity of sacrificial meat that has become impure, <b>and it</b><b> does not render it like pure </b>meat.

            "<b>Rav Mari strongly objects to this </b>conclusion: <b>Even granting</b><b> that Rabbi Yosei holds in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer </b>that an offering is accepted through the blood alone, even if the meat has become ritually impure, there is still a difficulty. <b>Granted, </b>in the case of animal <b>offerings, </b>which have two permitting factors, the blood and the meat, <b>there is </b>at least one of them, the <b>blood</b><b>, </b>for which the frontplate appeases God and causes the offering to be accepted. With regard to the <b><i>omer</i></b><b>, too, </b><b>there is the handful, </b>for which the frontplate appeases God and is thereby validated. With regard to <b>the shewbread, too</b><b>, there are the bowls </b>of frankincense, which permit the bread in the same manner that the handful permits a meal-offering. ", 
            "<b>But </b>with regard to <b>the two loaves, what is there</b><b> to say? </b>They are completely eaten, and nothing is brought on the altar. How can they be brought in a state of ritual impurity, as the mishna has stated, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei? ", 
            "<b>And if you say </b>that the two loaves are valid because the frontplate appeases God for the impurity of the two lambs <b>that are sacrificed</b><b> with them, this is </b>the same as <b>the communal </b><b>peace-offerings </b>that are mentioned separately in the mishna. <b>If </b><b>so, there are </b>only <b>four </b>offerings listed in the mishna. <b>But we learned </b>in the mishna that there are <b>five,</b> because the two loaves and the communal peace-offerings are listed separately.

            "<b>Rather, </b>the previous suggestion is rejected. Instead, it is suggested that <b>Rabbi</b><b> Yosei holds </b>that <b>ritual impurity is permitted in </b>cases involving <b>the public, </b>even without the frontplate. Therefore, the two loaves remain valid. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t </b>the following <i>baraita</i> <b>taught </b>concerning the purity of both the High Priest on Yom Kippur and the priest who burns the red heifer, each of whom is separated from his house for seven days to ensure his purity?

As it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi </b><b>Yehoshua says: </b>With regard to <b>all the offerings in the </b><b>Torah from which there remains an olive-bulk of meat </b>that is fit to be eaten <b>or an olive-bulk </b><b>of fa</b><b>t</b> that is fit to be sacrificed on the altar, <b>one </b>may <b>sprinkle the blood. </b>If all that remains is <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and half an</b><b> olive-bulk of fat</b><b>,</b><b> one </b>may <b>not sprinkle the</b><b> blood. </b>The fat is burned on the altar and the meat is eaten by the priests. Since the meat and fat serve different functions, they do not combine to equal the minimum amount that must remain in order to sprinkle the blood. ", 
            "<b>And</b><b> with regard to a burnt-offering, even </b>if all that was left was <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and</b><b> half an olive-bulk of fat, one </b>may <b>sprinkle the</b><b> blood because it is all consumed </b>on the altar. Since both the meat and the fat are sacrificed on the altar, they can be combined. <b>And with regard to</b><b> a meal-offering, although all of it remains </b>pure, <b>one </b>may <b>not sprinkle </b>the blood of the animal offering that is brought together with it. ", 
            "The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>What is </b>the mention of <b>a </b><b>meal-</b><b>offering</b><b> doing </b>here? The discussion is about sprinkling blood, which is not relevant in the case of a meal-offering. <b>Rav Pappa said: </b>The meal-offering under discussion is <b>the meal-offering </b>brought with the <b>libations </b>that accompany animal offerings. <b>It could enter your mind to say: Since it </b><b>comes due to the offering, it is comparable to the</b><b> offering itself. </b>One might think that even if the offering became impure but the meal-offering remained pure, one would be permitted to sprinkle the blood of the animal due to the remaining meal-offering. Consequently, <b>it teaches us </b>that this is not the case. ", 
            "<b>From where </b><b>do we </b>derive that if only the <b>fat </b>remains, one may sprinkle the blood of the offering? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said </b><b>in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, and </b>there are those who <b>determined </b>that <b>this </b><i>halakha</i> was stated <b>in the name </b><b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: As the verse states: </b>“And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting; <b>and he shall make the fat smoke for a satisfying</b><b> aroma to the Lord” </b>(Leviticus 17:6). This verse indicates that one may sprinkle the blood if the <b>fat </b>remains pure <b>although there is no </b>pure <b>meat. </b>", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>We </b><b>have found </b>a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one may sprinkle the blood if only <b>fat </b>remains; but if all that is left is <b>the diaphragm and </b>the <b>two kidneys, </b>which are also sacrificed on the altar, <b>from where do</b><b> we </b>derive that one may sprinkle the blood? ", 
            "The Gemara responds: <b>Where did</b><b> we say that one </b>may <b>sprinkle </b>the blood in such a case? The Gemara answers: The fact that one may sprinkle the blood in that case is clear <b>from </b>the fact <b>that it is taught </b>at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And with regard to a meal-offering, although all</b><b> of it remains </b>pure, <b>one </b>may <b>not sprinkle </b>the blood. It can be deduced from this statement that <b>it is</b><b> a meal-offering </b>for which <b>one </b>may <b>not sprinkle </b>the blood, as the meal-offering is not part of the animal; <b>but </b>with regard to <b>the diaphragm and the two</b><b> kidneys, it seems well </b>to sprinkle the blood if they remain. That being the case, <b>from where do we </b>derive this <i>halakha</i>? ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan himself said</b><b>, </b>this time without quoting <i>tanna</i>’<i>im</i>: <b>The verse </b>we quoted above <b>states: For a satisfying aroma, </b>which indicates that <b>anything</b><b> you raise as a satisfying aroma, </b>i.e., anything burned on the altar, is enough to sprinkle the blood. ", 
            "The Gemara notes: <b>And </b>it is <b>necessary to write fat </b>in that verse <b>and </b>it is <b>necessary to write: For a satisfying aroma. As, if</b><b> the Merciful One had written </b>only <b>fat, I would have</b><b> said </b>that if <b>fat </b>remains, <b>yes, </b>the blood may be sprinkled, but if only <b>the diaphragm and two kidneys </b>remain, which are not as significant as the fat, <b>no</b><b>, </b>the blood may not be sprinkled. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One</b><b> writes: For a satisfying aroma.

Therefore, <b>the</b><b> Merciful One writes fat, </b>to teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to sacrificial parts of the animal and not to accompanying libations and meal-offerings. ", 
            "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the entire <b>community or most of it became </b><b>ritually </b><b>impure</b><b>,</b> <b>or the priests were </b>all <b>impure and </b><b>the community was pure, they should perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in ritual impurity. </b>If <b>a minority of </b><b>the community became impure, </b>even if they are many people, <b>those who are pure perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>and those who are </b><b>impure perform </b>the ritual on <b>the second </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>. ", 
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The </b><b>Sages taught: </b>If most or all of <b>the Jewish people </b><b>were impure and the priests and sacred vessels </b>used in the Temple service were <b>pure; or, </b>conversely, if <b>the Jewish </b><b>people were pure and the priests and sacred vessels </b>were <b>impure; and even </b>in a situation in which <b>the Jewish </b><b>people and the priests were pure and the sacred vessels </b>were <b>impure, they </b>may <b>perform </b>any part of the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in ritual impurity. </b>The reason for this is that <b>a communal offering, </b>which is sacrificed even in a state of ritual impurity, <b>is not divided. </b>Therefore, since some of the service must be performed in a state of ritual impurity, it may all be performed in a state of ritual impurity. ", 
            "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: They taught </b>that the service may be done in a state of ritual impurity if the sacred vessels are impure <b>only </b>in a case where <b>the knife </b>to be used for slaughtering <b>became</b><b> impure through </b>contact with <b>one who was ritually impure </b>due to contact with <b>a corpse, as the Merciful One states</b><b>: </b>“And whoever shall touch on the open field <b>one </b><b>slain with a sword, </b>or one that died, or the bone of a man, or a grave, shall be impure for seven days” (Numbers 19:16). The Sages expounded: <b>A sword</b><b> is like a corpse. </b>Therefore, a sword or another metal implement that touches a corpse attains the same level of impurity as the corpse itself, which is the ultimate primary source of ritual impurity. Similarly, a knife that touches a person who is a primary source of ritual impurity due to contact with a corpse attains that same status. ", 
            "Therefore, <b>it renders impure the person</b> who uses it for slaughtering. In this case, <b>when </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>is initially performed, it is</b><b> performed in </b>a state of <b>ritual impurity of the body</b><b>.</b> Generally, one who is impure in this way is liable to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> if he eats sacrificial meat or enters the Temple. ", 
            "<b>However, </b>if <b>the knife became ritually impure with the impurity of a</b><b> creeping animal, which renders the meat impure but does not</b><b> render the person impure, </b>because something rendered impure by a primary source of ritual impurity becomes a secondary source of ritual impurity, which can render food impure but not people, <b>those who are pure </b>may <b>perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb, but <b>those who are impure may not </b><b>perform </b>the ritual. This is because <b>it is preferable that </b><b>one eat </b>the Paschal lamb <b>with impurity of the meat,</b> as the nature of its prohibition is that of a regular <b>negative commandment, and one should not eat the meat</b><b> with impurity of the body, which </b>renders one liable to receive <b><i>karet</i></b><b>. </b>", 
            "The Gemara comments on Rav Ḥisda’s attempt to distinguish between different types of impurity and to claim that the entire community sacrifices the Paschal lamb in a state of ritual impurity only when the people have become impure with a severe form of impurity. <b>Apparently, Rav Ḥisda holds </b>that <b>impurity is overridden in </b>cases involving <b>the public. </b>The prohibition of sacrificing offerings in a state of impurity is not wholly permitted for a community; rather, it is overridden in cases of great need. Therefore, whenever it is possible to minimize the severity of the impurity, in is necessary to do so. <b>And, so too, Rabbi Yitzḥak said </b>explicitly: <b>Impurity </b><b>is overridden in </b>cases involving <b>the public. </b>", 
            "<b>And Rava said </b>that whenever there is any form of ritual impurity involved in the service, <b>even those who are ritually impure may also perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb. <b>What is the </b><b>reason </b>for this? <b>As it is written: “And the flesh</b><b> that touches any impure thing shall not be eaten, it</b><b> shall be burned in fire; and the flesh, every one</b><b> that is pure may eat the flesh” </b>(Leviticus 7:19). ", 
            "Rava derives from this verse that <b>anywhere that we do not apply </b>the <i>halakha</i> that <b>“t</b><b>he flesh that touches any impure thing shall not be </b><b>eaten” </b>and the meat may be eaten despite being impure, <b>we </b>also <b>do not apply “and the flesh, every one </b><b>that is pure may eat the flesh.” </b>In that case, the meat may be eaten even by one who is impure. Just as the first half the verse is not applicable, the second half is also not applicable. It is only <b>anywhere that we apply </b>the <i>halakha</i> that <b>“the flesh that touches any </b><b>impure thing shall not be eaten” </b>that <b>we </b>also <b>apply</b> the second half of the verse:<b> “And the flesh, every</b><b> one that is pure may eat the flesh.” </b>Therefore, when the offering is sacrificed in a state of ritual impurity, there is no prohibition for impure people to eat it. ", 
            "<b>It was stated </b>that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the mishna’s statement that the Paschal lamb may be sacrificed in a state of impurity if the majority of the public is impure. In a case where <b>the Jewish people were </b>divided, and exactly<b> half </b>were<b> pure and half </b>were<b> impure</b><b>,</b><b> Rav</b><b> said half and half is like the majority, and Rav</b><b> Kahana said half and half is not like the majority</b><b>. </b>", 
            "The Gemara explains the dispute between Rav and Rav Kahana. <b>Rav said: Half and half is like the majority</b><b>,</b> meaning that each of the two groups has the status of the majority of the public. Therefore, <b>those </b>who are pure <b>perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for </b><b>themselves </b>in a state of ritual purity. <b>And those </b>who are impure <b>perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for </b><b>themselves </b>in a state of ritual impurity.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>Why </b>do so? <b>Let those </b>who are pure <b>perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on </b><b>their own </b>in a state of purity <b>and those </b>who are impure <b>perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on </b><b>their own </b>in a state of impurity. <b>Didn’t Rav</b> himself <b>say: </b>If half the community is ritually pure and half is ritually impure, <b>those </b>who are pure <b>perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves and those </b>who are impure <b>perform </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for</b><b> themselves?

            "However, <b>they are exempt from performing </b>the ritual of <b>the second </b><b><i>Pesaḥ</i></b><b>.</b> This is proof that Rabbi Yosei holds that their ritual impurity is retroactive. Therefore, at the time the Paschal lamb is slaughtered, it is uncertain whether they are ritually pure or impure, because if they have another discharge before the end of the day, they are retroactively considered to have been impure the entire time. From the fact that they are exempt from the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> even if it turns out that they were ritually impure, it appears that the frontplate does appease God for uncertain ritual impurity due to the discharge of a <i>zava</i>.

            "The Gemara responds to this attempted proof. <b>Say: What </b>is the meaning of Rabbi Yosei’s statement that the ritual impurity applies <b>retroactively? </b>It means that the ritual impurity applies by <b>rabbinic </b>decree. However, according to Torah law, the <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i> is impure only from the time of the new sighting and onward. ",

            "The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Whichever way you </b>look at Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, it is difficult: <b>If he holds </b>that that the <i>zav</i> <b>renders </b>objects <b>impure retroactively, </b>the new discharge <b>should cancel all</b> the days. Conversely, <b>if he holds </b>that the <i>zav</i> <b>renders</b> objects <b>impure from now and onward, it should not cancel</b><b> even its own day. </b>Since part of the seventh day was clean, the <i>zav</i> is considered to have successfully completed his seven clean days, and the new discharge renders him impure for only one day. <b>Rather, say instead </b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows: <b>It should not cancel even its</b><b> own day. </b>", 
            "<b>And </b>Rabbi Oshaya <b>said to him: </b>I do not agree with you, but know that <b>Rabbi Yosei</b><b>, </b>who exempts one in this circumstance from the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>holds in accordance with your </b>opinion. The Gemara analyses Rabbi Oshaya’s statement: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yosei say </b>that <b>they render </b>objects designed for <b>lying and sitting impure retroactively</b><b>, </b>whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that they render these items impure only from the time of the new discharge and onward? <b>Rather, </b>must one <b>not conclude from this that </b>when Rabbi Yosei said <b>he renders </b>these items <b>impure retroactively, </b>he meant that this ruling is <b>due to rabbinic </b>decree and is not Torah law? The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from </b><b>this. </b>", 
            "The Gemara returns to its discussion of whether the leniency of impurity of the deep applies to priests and Rava’s attempt to prove that it does, based upon Rabbi Ḥiyya’s statement that impurity of the deep is permitted only with regard to ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. The Gemara asks: <b>According to </b><b>Rabbi Yosei, now that he said </b>that a <i>zav</i> who immersed and then saw an additional discharge <b>renders </b>items <b>impure </b>only <b>from now and onward </b>according to Torah law, and not retroactively, Rabbi Ḥiyya’s statement that the leniency of impurity of the deep applies <b>only to </b>ritual impurity imparted by <b>a corpse </b>was stated <b>to exclude what </b>other case? Rabbi Ḥiyya could not have been excluding impurity due to the discharge of a <i>zav</i> or <i>zava</i>, as suggested above, because their offerings are valid even without the frontplate placating God. ", 
            "<b>Let us</b><b> resolve </b>the dilemma <b>from this </b>statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya, as it must come to exclude impurity from a creeping animal. If so, it must be referring to <b>a priest, and</b><b> impurity of the deep is permitted for him. </b>", 
            "<b>Say </b>in response to this attempted proof: <b>Actually, </b>you can explain that it refers to the impurity of <b>the owners and to </b>a case where they are offering <b>the Paschal lamb, and </b>Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>holds </b>that <b>one</b><b> may not slaughter </b>an offering <b>and sprinkle </b>its blood <b>for</b> those who are <b>impure from a creeping animal. </b>Therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether this <i>halakha</i> applies to those unknowingly rendered impure by a creeping animal, <b>and it was</b><b> necessary to exclude </b>this case and teach that the leniency of impurity of the deep applies only to ritual impurity imparted by a corpse and not to impurity from a creeping animal.

            "The Gemara answers: A case of a full-fledged <i>zava</i> is found <b>in </b>a woman <b>who continuously </b><b>flows, </b>i.e., she experiences a continuous discharge of blood that spans three days. <b>If you wish, say </b>instead that the case is <b>where she saw </b>a discharge <b>for two</b><b> entire twilights, </b>meaning that she experienced a discharge for the entire twilight period on two consecutive days.

            "<b>Rav Yosef raised a dilemma: </b>With regard to <b>the</b><b> priest who facilitates acceptance of the daily offering</b><b>,</b><b> is</b><b> ritual impurity of the deep permitted for him or not</b><b>? </b>The two sides of the dilemma are as follows: <b>If</b><b> you say </b>that <b>the priest who facilitates acceptance of the</b><b> offerings of the nazirite and </b>of <b>one who performs </b>the ritual of <b>the Paschal lamb, ritual impurity of the deep</b><b> is permitted for him, </b>then in the case of <b>the</b><b> priest who facilitates acceptance of the daily offering, what </b>is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say </b>that <b>when we learned </b>the <i>halakha</i> of <b>impurity of the deep </b>through oral tradition, it was <b>with regard to the Paschal lamb, </b>but <b>with </b><b>regard to the daily offering we did not learn </b>it? <b>Or perhaps </b>we can <b>derive </b>that the <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>the daily offering from </b>the fact that it applies to the <b>Paschal lamb? </b>", 
            "<b>Rabba said: </b>This dilemma can be resolved through an <b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b><b> inference: </b><b>Just as in a place where known ritual impurity is </b><b>not permitted for him, </b>e.g., with regard to the Paschal lamb, for which known impurity disqualifies the offering and one would have to observe the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, nonetheless <b>impurity </b><b>of the deep is permitted for him, </b>all the more so <b>in a place </b>where <b>known ritual impurity is permitted </b><b>for him, </b>with regard to communal offerings, as such offerings may be sacrificed even in a known state of impurity if there is no way to sacrifice the offering in a state of purity, "

            "The Gemara answers: <b>We derive it from </b>the exposition of <b>Rabbi</b><b> Shimon, as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b><b> Shimon says: </b>The verse that states: “Any sin-offering from which some blood has been brought to the Tent of Meeting, to make atonement <b>in the sacred place, </b>shall not be eaten; <b>it shall be burned in fire” </b>(Leviticus 6:23), <b>has taught that the burning of a sin-offering</b><b> is in the sacred </b>area, the Temple courtyard.

            "<b>I have </b>derived <b>only </b>that the <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>this alone, </b>a sin-offering; with regard to <b>the rest of the disqualified offerings of the most </b><b>sacred order and the portions of offerings of lesser sanctity </b>that are consumed on the altar, <b>from where do we </b>derive that they must be burned in the Temple courtyard, which is their boundary when they are valid? <b>The verse </b><b>states: “Any…in the sacred place…shall be burned in </b><b>fire,” </b>which teaches that any consecrated item must be burned in a sacred place.

            "The Gemara asks further: <b>We found </b>a source for <b>offerings of the most </b><b>sacred order; from where do we derive </b>that it also applies to <b>offerings of lesser sanctity?

            "The Gemara proceeds to ask an unrelated question with regard to <i>piggul</i>: <b>And according to </b>the opinion of <b>the </b><b><i>tanna</i></b><b> from the school of Rabba bar Avuh, </b><b>who said </b>that <b>even </b><b><i>piggul</i></b><b>, </b>which is a disqualification of the animal itself, <b>requires decay of form, </b>meaning that it must be left over until the next day so that it will begin to decay and is only then burned, <b>from where do we </b>derive that it requires decay of form? ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is </b><b>derived </b>from a verbal analogy from the parallel words <b>“iniquity</b><b>” </b>and <b>“iniquity.” </b>With regard to <i>piggul</i>, the verse states: “It remains rejected [<i>piggul</i>]; and the soul that eats it shall bear its iniquity” (Leviticus 7:18), and with regard to <b>leftover </b>sacrificial meat, the verse states: “And whatever is leftover…shall be burned in fire…and each of those who eat it shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 19:6–8). Just as leftover sacrificial meat is burned after it has been left over to the next day, so too, <i>piggul</i> is burned only after it has been left over to the next day and its form has decayed. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Let us </b>instead <b>learn </b>the rules of <i>piggul</i> <b>through </b>a verbal analogy based on the parallel words <b>“iniquity” </b>and <b>“iniquity” </b>from <b>the sin-offering of Aaron</b><b>, </b>with regard to which the verse states: “Why did you not eat the sin-offering in the place of sanctity…and He gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17). The sin-offering of Aaron was burned immediately, without decay of form, so why can it not be learned from there that <i>piggul</i> does not require decay of form either?

", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Now that we say </b>that we have accepted the conclusion that <b>all disqualified sacred </b>offerings must be <b>burned</b><b>, </b>and it is <b>no different </b>whether they are disqualified <b>offerings</b><b> of the most sacred order </b>or <b>offerings of lesser sanctity</b><b>, </b>because in both cases <b>they learned it as a </b><b>tradition, </b>with regard to the verse that says: <b>“In the</b><b> sacred place…shall be burned in fire,” why do I</b> need it? What does this verse teach that is not known from oral tradition? The Gemara answers: <b>That </b>verse <b>is</b><b> required </b>to teach that the requirement of burning that is learned from the oral tradition cannot take place anywhere; <b>its</b><b> burning </b>must take place only <b>in the sacred </b>place, the Temple courtyard. ", 
            "The Gemara asks further: If the source of the <i>halakha</i> is an oral tradition, with regard to the verse that states: <b>“The flesh that touches any impure item shall</b><b> not be eaten, it shall be burned in fire” </b>(Leviticus 7:19), <b>why do I </b>need it? This <i>halakha</i> is included in the oral tradition and should not require its own verse. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>That </b>verse is <b>necessary </b><b>for itself. It could enter your mind to say </b>that <b>disqualified sacred </b>offerings include only a case <b>where its blood </b><b>was left overnight </b>instead of being sprinkled on the altar on the day the offering was slaughtered; or <b>its blood </b><b>was spilled; </b>or <b>its blood was taken outside </b>the hangings; <b>and </b>similarly, the case of an offering that <b>was slaughtered </b><b>at night. </b>In all these cases, the offering must be <b>burned </b>because these are disqualifications unique to sanctified offerings <b>that </b><b>do not exist with regard to unconsecrated </b>items. ", 
            "<b>But </b>if the meat <b>became ritually impure, which disqualifies </b><b>unconsecrated </b>meat <b>also, say </b>that <b>since it was treated in </b><b>the manner of unconsecrated items, </b>as the disqualification is not unique to consecrated items, <b>it should not require burning, and </b><b>burial should be sufficient for it</b><b>.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us </b>that an offering that is disqualified through ritual impurity must also be burned. ", 
            "It was taught in the mishna that if <b>the owners </b>of the offering <b>became ritually impur</b><b>e</b><b> or died </b>before the offering was completed, <b>its form </b>must be left to <b>decay</b><b>, </b>and it is burned after the first day of the Festival. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka disagrees and says that it is burned immediately. <b>Rav Yosef said: </b>This <b>dispute </b>is about a case in which <b>the owners became ritually impure after</b><b> the sprinkling </b>of the blood, <b>because the meat was fit</b><b> for eating </b>since all its services were completed in a valid way. <b>But </b>if <b>the owners became ritually impure before</b><b> the sprinkling </b>of the blood, such that <b>the meat </b><b>was not fit for eating </b>even for a moment, <b>all </b><b>agree </b>that <b>it should be burned immediately.</b>", 
            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>to this statement based on the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>This is the principle: </b>In <b>all </b>cases in which <b>its disqualification is in itself, it should be </b><b>burned immediately. </b>If the disqualification is <b>in the blood </b>of the offering or <b>in the owners, its form </b>should be left to <b>decay, and </b>then <b>it should be taken out </b><b>to the place </b>designated for <b>burning. </b>", 
            "The following inference can be made based on the formulation of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>It is teaching </b>that the case of disqualified <b>owners </b>is <b>similar to </b>the case of disqualified <b>blood</b><b>:</b><b> Just </b><b>as </b>in the case of <b>blood </b>the disqualification necessarily occurred <b>before the sprinkling </b>of the blood, as the offering is not disqualified if anything happens to the blood after sprinkling, <b>so too, </b>the case of <b>owners </b>is referring to one in which they became disqualified even <b>before the sprinkling </b>of the blood, which contradicts the statement of Rav Yosef. ", 
            "<b>Rather, if </b>this <b>was stated </b>in the name of Rav Yosef, <b>it was stated as follows: </b>This <b>dispute </b>is specifically about a case in which <b>the owners became ritually</b><b> impure before the sprinkling </b>of the blood, such that <b>the</b><b> meat was never fit for eating, which </b>makes it <b>as</b><b> though its disqualification is in itself. But </b>if <b>the owners</b><b> became ritually impure after sprinkling </b>of the blood, such that <b>the meat was fit for eating, all agree </b>that <b>its disqualification is due to a different matter, </b>i.e., an external factor, <b>and it requires decay of form. </b>", 
            "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b><b> said: Even </b>a case in which the owners became ritually impure <b>after sprinkling </b>the blood <b>is </b>included in <b>the dispute</b> about whether decay of form is necessary. <b>And Rabbi </b><b>Yoḥanan follows his </b>line of <b>reasoning, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </b><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and Rabbi Neḥemya said the same </b><b>thing. </b>The statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka is that </b><b>which we said. </b>", 
            "With regard to <b>Rabbi </b><b>Neḥemya, what is </b>the ruling in which he expressed his opinion? It is <b>as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥemya says: </b>Aaron’s sin-offering that was burned on the eighth day of inauguration <b>was burned due to</b><b> acute mourning</b><b>,</b> as that was the day his sons Nadav and Avihu died. <b>For this </b>reason, <b>it is stated</b> that Aaron explained to Moses: “Now that events such <b>as</b><b> these </b>befell me, were I to eat this day’s sin-offering would the Lord approve?” (Leviticus 10:19). In other words, it was due to the deaths of his sons, which Aaron referred as “events such as these,” that Aaron burned the sin-offering instead of eating it. ", 
            "Rabbi Yoḥanan analyzes Rabbi Neḥemya’s statement: <b>Now, acute mourning is similar to </b>a case of disqualification <b>after sprinkling </b>of the blood, because acute mourning merely disqualifies the owners from eating the offering. It does not disqualify the actual performance of the sacrificial service by a High Priest, such as Aaron. Therefore, it is like other disqualifications that take effect after the sprinkling, which simply prohibit the eating of the meat. <b>And when it</b><b> was burned, it was burned immediately, </b>without waiting until the following day. This shows that Rabbi Neḥemya agrees that an offering that becomes disqualified after its blood has been sprinkled should be burned immediately. "

            "<b>Rabba adds </b>that these tanna’im were not the only ones who maintain this opinion; <b>even Rabbi Yosei HaGelili </b>agreed with them, <b>as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The entire matter </b>that is stated in the verse: “Any sin-offering from which some blood has been brought to the Tent of Meeting, to make atonement in the sacred place, shall not be eaten; it shall be burned in fire” (Leviticus 6:23) is not stated with regard to a regular sin-offering improperly brought inside the Sanctuary; rather, it <b>speaks only about bulls that are burned and goats that are burned</b><b>.</b> These are unique sin-offerings, and the Torah states that their blood should be brought inside the Sanctuary. The verse is stated with regard to these sin-offerings both in order to command the Jewish people <b>to burn the disqualified ones</b><b> in the place of the </b><b><i>bira</i></b> on the Temple Mount <b>and </b>in order <b>to establish a prohibition with regard to</b><b> their </b><b>consumption</b><b>. </b>", 
            "The Rabbis <b>said</b><b> to </b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: If you expound the verse in this fashion, then with regard to a regular <b>sin-offering</b><b> whose blood entered inside </b>the Sanctuary, <b>from where </b>is it derived that it must be burned? <b>He said to</b><b> them: </b>It is derived from the verse: <b>“Behold, its </b><b>blood was not brought into the Sanctuary within” </b>(Leviticus 10:18).

            "The Gemara explains: <b>And</b><b> Rabbi Yoḥanan </b>did not include Rabbi Yosei HaGelili because Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds </b>that there is a difference between the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and those of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and Rabbi Neḥemya.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>What are </b><b>the circumstances </b>in which <b>these bones </b>must be burned? <b>If </b><b>we say </b>that <b>there is no marrow in them, why </b>must they be <b>burned?

            "<b>Granted, if you say that </b>an item that <b>serves </b>as a base or container for <b>leftover is something </b>significant and becomes disqualified in the same manner as the leftover themselves, <b>because of this it needs </b><b>burning </b>like the leftover itself. <b>But if you say that </b><b>serving </b>as a base for <b>leftover is nothing </b>significant, <b>why </b><b>do these </b>bones need to be <b>burned?

The prohibition to break the bones of the Paschal lamb applies even when the Paschal lamb itself may no longer be eaten. Thus, the bones must be burned because there is no way to extract the marrow.

            "The Gemara adds: <b>And who is the </b><b><i>tanna</i></b><b> who differentiates between </b>a Paschal lamb <b>that had a time when it was valid and </b>one that <b>did not have a time when it was </b><b>valid?

            "The Gemara <b>raises an objection </b>based on what was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>No bones of</b><b> offerings require burning except for the bones of the Paschal</b><b> lamb, due to the </b>possibility that leaving the bones around will lead to <b>a mishap </b>because one may eventually transgress the prohibition of breaking the bones.

            "<b>Rav Yehuda said </b>that <b>Rav said: All the sinews </b>in an animal are considered <b>like meat. </b>Therefore, one can fulfill his obligation to eat the Paschal lamb by eating them and one can register for them, <b>except for the sinews</b><b> of the neck, </b>which are so hard that they are not considered meat.

However, since there is no absolute proof that this is correct, the sciatic nerve must be removed from both sides. Although in theory the forbidden sciatic nerve may be discarded and the permitted one may be eaten, since there is uncertainty as to which one is permitted, neither of them may be eaten. Both must be burned. ", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we then conclude that Rabbi Yehuda </b><b>was uncertain </b>about which sciatic nerve is forbidden? The Sages were unsure whether Rabbi Yehuda was absolutely convinced that it is the sciatic nerve from the right side that is forbidden, or if he was saying that this would seem likely to be the case, but he was not certain. <b>As, if it were clear to him </b>that it is the sciatic nerve from the right thigh that is forbidden, the proper procedure would be different: <b>The one that is </b><b>permitted we should eat, and </b>the one <b>that is forbidden </b><b>we should discard. Why should he </b>require <b>burning? </b>", 
            "<b>Rav Ika bar Ḥinnana said, </b>in response to this attempted proof: The mishna addresses a case <b>where </b>the two sciatic nerves <b>were known, but in the end </b>became <b>mixed </b>together. In other words, at first it was known which was the forbidden right nerve and which was the permitted left nerve. However, they were then mixed together and can no longer be identified. Therefore, due to the uncertainty, they must both be burned. ", 
            "<b>Rav Ashi said: </b>The mishna’s ruling that the sinews must be burned <b>is </b><b>necessary only </b>with regard to <b>the fat of the sciatic </b><b>nerve, as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The fat </b>around the sciatic nerve <b>is permitted </b>according to Torah law, but <b>the Jewish people are hol</b><b>y</b><b> and treat it </b><b>as forbidden. </b>Since it is permitted according to Torah law, it has the status of meat and may not be simply discarded. However, since the Jewish people treat it as forbidden, they do not eat it even from the Paschal lamb. Therefore, it is left until after the time when the meat may be eaten and burned in accordance with the general <i>halakha</i> of leftover. ", 
            "<b>Ravina said: </b>This discussion pertains to the <b>outer </b>nerve, <b>and </b>it is in accordance with that which <b>Rav Yehuda said </b>that <b>Shmuel said, as Rav Yehuda </b><b>said </b>that <b>Shmuel said: There are two sinew</b><b>s</b> in the sciatic nerve: The <b>inner </b>sinew <b>that is next to the</b><b> bone is forbidden </b>according to Torah law, <b>and one is</b><b> liable </b>to be flogged <b>for </b>eating <b>it.

            "<b>Ḥizkiya said, and similarly, </b>one of the Sages in <b>the school of Ḥizkiya taught: The verse </b><b>states: “And you shall not leave any of it until </b><b>morning; and that which remains of it until morning you </b><b>shall burn with fire” </b>(Exodus 12:10). <b>As </b>there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state “until morning,” </b>and repeating that phrase adds nothing to the verse, <b>what </b>is the meaning when <b>the verse states “until morning”? </b>It is <b>to</b><b> give it a second morning for its burning. </b>In other words, it comes to teach that the mitzva to burn the leftover does not apply on the first morning, i.e., the morning of the Festival when they become prohibited to eat, but on the second morning, the sixteenth of Nisan. However, when the sixteenth falls on Shabbat, the burning is delayed until the seventeenth. ", 
            "<b>Abaye said: </b>The reason is because <b>the verse states: “The burnt-</b><b>offering </b><b>of each Shabbat </b><b>on its Shabbat </b>in addition to the continual burnt-offering and its libation” (Numbers 28:10). This indicates that the burnt-offering of Shabbat may be offered on the altar on Shabbat or burned if it is disqualified, but <b>not the </b><b>burnt-offering of a weekday on Shabbat, and not the </b><b>burnt-offering of a weekday on a Festival. </b>It is derived from here that one may not burn anything on Shabbat that is not an obligation of that day. ", 
            "<b>Rava said </b>a different reason: <b>The verse states </b>concerning Festivals: “And on the first day there shall be a sacred convocation; no kind of labor shall be done on them, save that which every man must eat, <b>only</b><b> that may be done for you” </b>(Exodus 12:16). From this verse one can infer the following: <b>That, </b>i.e., the food itself, you may prepare, <b>but </b>you may <b>not </b>perform acts that <b>facilitate its </b>preparation, which must be done beforehand. The word <b>only </b>is also exclusive; it indicates that only food preparation is permitted, "

            "<b>but not a circumcision</b> that is <b>not at its </b>ideal <b>time</b>.

This needed to be emphasized. Otherwise, it would have <b>come </b>to be derived <b>through an </b><b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that circumcision does override Shabbat and Festivals, based on the fact that it overrides the laws of leprosy. Therefore, the Torah emphasized that circumcision performed later than the eighth day does not override Festivals. ", 
            "<b>Rav Ashi said </b>a different reason that the leftover Paschal lamb is not burned on the Festival: The obligation of <b>solemn rest </b>stated with regard to Festivals <b>is a positive </b>mitzva.

            "The Gemara answers: <b>It is </b>a case of <b>ritual impurity </b>in <b>a concealed </b>place, as the part that has gone out would impart ritual impurity to the portion that has not gone out due to the contact they make underneath the skin, which is concealed from view; and the principle is that <b>ritual impurity </b>in <b>a </b><b>concealed </b>place <b>does not render </b>other objects <b>impure. </b>",

            "<b>Rav Yosef said: Can a </b><b>person get up and ask </b>based on the <b>Sanctuary?

Therefore, the answer mentioned earlier, that everything in those plans was based upon divine inspiration, is not relevant. In that case, one should be able to derive that all the roofs were sanctified. ", 
            "The Gemara responds: <b>And </b>how <b>can you </b><b>understand </b>it that way? <b>Isn’t it teaching: </b>In the case of <b>these roofs </b>of the courtyard and the chambers located there, <b>one may not eat offerings of the most </b><b>sacred order and one may not slaughter offerings of lesser </b><b>sanctity there </b>because they do not have the sanctity of the courtyard? <b>However, that is difficult. </b>It contradicts the previous statement that <b>the roof is sanctified. Rav Ḥama bar</b><b> Gurya said: </b>The roof of the Sanctuary was considered sanctified only because <b>those two </b>measuring rods used to measure <b>cubit</b><b>s</b> were stored there. ", 
            "<b>As we learned </b>in a mishna: <b>There were two </b>rods for measuring <b>cubits in </b>the chamber called <b>Shushan the Capital, one in the northeast corner and</b><b> one in the southeast corner.

Consequently</b><b>, </b>the second measuring rod was <b>longer than Moses’ </b>cubit <b>by</b> a full <b>fingerbreadth. </b>", 
            "<b>And why </b>did they construct two measures for cubits, <b>one large and one small? </b>It was <b>so </b><b>that the artisans </b>who were working in the Temple <b>would </b><b>take </b>payment according the amount of work they did, as measured <b>by the small </b>cubit, <b>and return </b>it to the Temple through their work, as measured <b>by the large </b>cubit, <b>so they would not come to misuse consecrated property.</b> If they would accept any payment that they did not deserve, they would be misusing consecrated property. Therefore, this system of measuring was instituted in order to slightly reduce their payment and prevent accidental misuse of Temple funds. The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I </b>need <b>two </b>large cubits? The Gemara answers: <b>One, </b>the shorter of the two, was <b>for</b><b> silver and gold</b><b>,</b> so that the artisans would not lose too much, <b>and one was for construction. </b>", 
            "<b>We learned </b>in the mishna: <b>The </b>space within the <b>windows and the thickness of the wall were </b>considered to be <b>inside. </b>The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, </b>with regard to the windows, <b>you will find it </b>to be sanctified with the sanctity of the Temple courtyard <b>when it is </b><b>level with the ground of the courtyard. But </b>with regard to <b>the thickness of the wall, </b>which must have been significantly above the ground, under <b>what circumstances </b>can <b>you find </b>it to be level with the ground of the courtyard? Even the roofs of chambers in the courtyard were not sanctified; therefore, if the thickness of the wall was not level with the floor of the courtyard, it would certainly not have been sanctified. ", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>You </b><b>find it in </b>the case of <b>the low wall </b>on the Temple Mount, which was the same height as the floor of the courtyard. This low wall is mentioned in the Bible, <b>as it is written: “He has made the </b><b>rampart and wall mourn” </b>(Lamentations 2:8), <b>and Rabbi Aḥa said</b><b>, and some say </b>it in the name of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b><b>, </b>that this double language of both rampart and wall in the verse is referring to <b>a wall and a low</b><b> wal</b><b>l</b> that were next to each other.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>With </b><b>regard to what </b>principle <b>do they disagree? </b>The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds that the consonantal text of the Torah </b><b>is authoritative; </b>meaning, the primary understanding of the verse is according to the way it is spelled. If this is the case, the verse may be rendered: In one house shall he eat it [<i>yokhal</i>], referring to the person eating the Paschal lamb. This would indicate that one eating from the Paschal lamb must eat in one location, but the verse does not prohibit dividing the offering between multiple groups. <b>And Rabbi Shimon holds that the vocalized text of the</b><b> Torah is authoritative</b><b>.</b> Since the word is pronounced <i>ye</i><i>’akhel</i>, it is clear that it is referring to the Paschal lamb itself, and the verse requires that the offering be consumed by a single group of people (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).

            "The Gemara attempts to clarify this <i>halakha</i>: If members of a group <b>were sitting </b>and eating the Paschal lamb, <b>and a partition was spread between them </b>such that they now constitute two separate groups, <b>according to </b>Rabbi Yehuda, <b>who</b><b> says a Paschal lamb may be eaten in two groups</b><b>, they may </b>continue to <b>eat; according to </b>Rabbi Shimon, <b>who</b><b> says a Paschal lamb may not be eaten in two</b><b> groups, they may not </b>continue to <b>eat </b>because they now constitute two groups.

The Gemara therefore rejects this suggestion: <b>Rabbi Zeira said: </b>The <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is not based on retroactive clarification, but rather on the following principle: The verse states: “They shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, <b>a lamb for a household” </b>(Exodus 12:3), indicating that a minor’s membership in the household is sufficient for him to be registered in the household’s Paschal lamb <b>in any case, </b>even without his agreement.",

Since it is not possible to identify which lamb the hide came from, the meat of <b>all </b>of the lambs must <b>go out</b><b> to the place </b>designated <b>for burning. </b>Nevertheless, all five people <b>are exempt from observing </b>the <b>second </b><b><i>Pesaḥ</i></b><b>.</b>", 
            "It is with regard to this <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abaye said: They taught </b>that they are all exempt from the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> in a case <b>where </b>the hides <b>were mixed up together only after the sprinkling </b>of the blood on the altar, <b>for at the time </b><b>the blood </b>of each of the other four animals <b>was </b><b>sprinkled, </b>each one of the four unblemished lambs <b>was, at </b><b>any rate, fit to be eaten, </b>and therefore the owners are considered to have fulfilled their obligation to slaughter a fit Paschal lamb.

            "The Gemara comments: <b>The one who </b><b>teaches </b>this statement of Abaye as <b>referring to </b>the case in <b>the mishna, </b>where the disqualification is due only to a lack of awareness of which animals are registered for whom, but the animals themselves are inherently valid to be used, he would say that Abaye’s ruling applies <b>all</b><b> the more so to the </b><b><i>baraita</i></b><b>, </b>where the disqualification is due to a blemish in the body of the animal itself. However, <b>the one who teaches </b>Abaye’s statement as referring <b>to </b>the case in <b>the </b><b><i>baraita</i></b> would say that <b>with regard to the mishna, no, </b>it does not apply. <b>Since </b>both animals <b>are </b>inherently <b>valid </b>to be used, <b>for if </b>the slave <b>remembers </b>which animal the master requested, each one <b>will be fit to be eaten, </b>the following may be said: <b>It is revealed before </b>God in <b>Heaven </b>which offering belongs to which person; the lack of awareness of this information does not impinge of the offerings’ validity, and therefore both the master and slave are exempt from the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.", 
            "The Gemara returns to discuss the previously mentioned <i>baraita</i> concerning five people who offered Paschal lambs, and it was made clear that one of the lambs was invalid: <b>The Master said: </b>All of them <b>are exempt from observing </b>the <b>second </b><b><i>Pesaḥ</i></b><b>. </b>The Gemara asks: <b>But there is one, </b>the owner of the lamb with the blemished hide, <b>who did not </b><b>fulfill </b>his obligation to bring a valid Paschal lamb. How then can all five be exempt?", 
            "The Gemara answers: <b>Because it is not possible </b>to do otherwise; for <b>what</b><b> should he do? Let each one </b>of the five <b>bring a Paschal lamb. </b>This would not be a solution. <b>They would be bringing unconsecrated animals into the </b>Temple <b>courtyard, </b><b>since four of them, </b>i.e., the owners of the unblemished lambs, <b>have already </b>validly <b>performed </b>the ritual of the Paschal lamb. They are not obligated to bring another Paschal lamb; therefore, they are unable to consecrate another Paschal lamb. If they attempt to do so, the lamb remains unconsecrated and may not be brought into the Temple courtyard.", 
            "The Gemara suggests an alternative way for the five to ensure that they have all fulfilled their obligations: <b>Let</b><b> them all bring one Paschal lamb </b>as a unified group. The Gemara rejects this as well: This would also not be a solution. <b>It would turn out that the Paschal</b><b> lamb was eaten by those who have not registered for</b><b> it, </b>since one who has already fulfilled his obligation to bring a Paschal lamb is unable to be registered in a group formed in order to offer another one.", 
            "<b>What is this? </b>Surely a solution can be found by using the following stipulation: <b>Let each one</b><b> bring his Paschal lamb and stipulate and say: If mine</b><b> was the blemished </b>lamb, <b>this </b>lamb <b>that I am </b><b>bringing now shall be a Paschal lamb, and if mine </b><b>was unblemished, this </b>lamb <b>that I am bringing now shall </b><b>be a peace-offering.</b>",

            "The Gemara suggests that it may still be possible to find a way to use the stipulation: <b>Let each one </b>of these five people bringing a new Paschal lamb <b>bring a priest </b>to be registered <b>with him </b>for their Paschal lamb.

            "The Gemara identifies a further distinction between a peace-offering and the Paschal lamb that precludes the use of the stipulation: <b>Rather, </b>the reason it is not possible to use the stipulation is <b>because it would reduce the </b>amount of time available for <b>eating the peace-offering, for a Paschal</b><b> lamb </b>may be eaten only <b>for a day and a</b><b> night, whereas a peace-offering </b>may be eaten <b>for two</b><b> days and one night. </b>Were the stipulation to be made, all the offerings would have an uncertain status of either being a peace-offering or a Paschal lamb. They would therefore all be treated with the strictures of a Paschal lamb, and any meat remaining on the morning after the first night would have to be burnt. However, in the event that the offering was actually a peace-offering, this would be premature, since it may still be eaten for another day.", 
            "The Gemara modifies the proposed stipulation: Instead of making a stipulation between a Paschal lamb and a regular peace-offering, <b>let </b>each one of <b>them </b>specify that if they have already fulfilled their obligations to bring a Paschal lamb, their intention is to consecrate and <b>bring </b>the current offering as <b>a surplus Paschal lamb. </b>The status of a surplus Paschal lamb is usually achieved when an animal is originally consecrated as a Paschal lamb but for some reason is not offered. Such an animal is offered as a type of peace-offering.", 
            "The Gemara assumes here that it is also possible to consecrate an animal directly with this status, and therefore the following stipulation could be used. <b>And </b>when bringing their lambs <b>they should </b>each <b>say: If mine was the blemished </b>lamb, <b>this </b>lamb <b>that I am bringing now shall be</b><b> a Paschal lamb; </b>and <b>if mine was unblemished, this </b>lamb <b>that I am bringing now shall be a </b>surplus Paschal lamb, which is type of <b>peace-offering </b>and may therefore be offered even if one has already fulfilled his obligation to bring a Paschal lamb.

            "The Gemara challenges this suggestion: <b>But can we designate</b> animals <b>initially </b>as <b>surplus </b>Paschal lambs? This cannot be done; the sanctity of a surplus Paschal lamb is achieved only with an animal that was initially designated for a Paschal lamb but remained unused. If so, how is the suggested stipulation tenable? The Gemara explains: <b>Let them trouble themselves </b>to find <b>and bring </b>an unused leftover animal already invested with the sanctity of <b>a surplus Paschal lamb, </b>and let them make the suggested stipulation upon it. In this way, the stipulation should work and provide a solution.", 
            "The Gemara identifies a distinction that exists even between a Paschal lamb and a surplus Paschal lamb that precludes the use of even this suggested stipulation. <b>Rather, </b>it is not possible to use the stipulation <b>because </b>of the requirement to perform the act of <b>placing </b>one’s hands on the head of the offering, <b>for a Paschal lamb </b><b>does not need </b>the act of <b>placing </b>one’s hands, <b>whereas a surplus </b>Paschal lamb, since it is a type of peace-offering, <b>does need </b>the act of <b>placing </b>one’s hands.

            "The Gemara identifies a further distinction between a Paschal lamb and a surplus Paschal lamb that precludes the use of the stipulation: <b>Rather, </b>it is not possible to use the stipulation <b>because </b>of the requirement to apply <b>presentations </b>of sacrificial blood upon the altar. <b>For whereas </b>the blood of <b>a Paschal lamb </b>is applied to the altar in <b>one presentation, </b>the blood of a peace-offering is applied to the altar with <b>two that</b><b> constitute four</b><b>,</b> i.e., the blood is applied on two opposite corners so that it runs down all four sides of the altar.",

            "A mishna and <i>baraita</i> that the Gemara cites later on in the discussion teach that, logically, were it not for a verse teaching otherwise, the prohibition against using as an offering an animal given as payment for a prostitute’s services should apply even in a case where the animal had already been consecrated as an offering before being given as payment. <b>Abaye said: If not that Rabbi Oshaya established</b> that <b>that </b>mishna is referring to a case of <b>one</b><b> who registers a prostitut</b><b>e</b><b> for his Paschal lamb </b>as her payment, <b>and </b>this position <b>is </b>in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi, whom Rabbi Oshaya apparently understood and who holds that a person retains monetary rights to his Paschal lamb even after consecration, which is why one is able to register the prostitute for it, <b>I would </b><b>have established that </b>mishna as referring only to <b>offerings of </b><b>lesser sanctity and </b>claimed it is <b>in accordance with the </b><b>opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, </b>who <b>said: Offerings of lesser </b><b>sanctity are the monetary property of their owners, </b>and therefore it is possible for the owner to use them as payment for a prostitute.", 
            "<b>But </b>I would have presumed that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that <b>a Paschal lamb </b>is unlike regular offerings of lesser sanctity, in that <b>a person does not</b><b> restrict </b>its consecration in order to retain monetary rights to it, and it is therefore not considered to be his property at all. However, with regard to <b>money </b>consecrated for a Paschal lamb, <b>a person certainly restricts </b>its consecration. <b>When</b><b> one initially designates it, he designated it with this intent</b><b>: </b>If he should wish to purchase a portion in someone else’s Paschal lamb that was already consecrated, then the money should remain non-sacred in order to allow for that purchase to take hold.", 
            "I would have therefore been able to explain that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Due to this </b>opinion of his, the <b>money in</b><b> the hand </b>of the owner of the lamb, which he received for selling a share in his Paschal lamb, <b>is non-sacred because, </b>although <b>with regard to the Paschal </b><b>lamb a person does not restrict </b>its consecration, <b>with regard </b><b>to money a person certainly restricts </b>its consecration.", 
            "Abaye continues his line of thinking: <b>And that </b>mishna <b>that Rabbi Oshaya established as </b>being <b>in</b><b> accordance </b>with the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi, <b>I </b><b>would not establish it as </b>being <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi.

            "Abaye admits that there is a problem with explaining the <i>baraita</i> in this way: <b>However, this, </b>the <i>baraita</i> we are addressing, <b>cannot </b><b>be established </b>in <b>accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, </b><b>for it </b>also <b>teaches </b>in a different clause that <b>one </b><b>who sells his burnt-offering and peace-offerings has not </b><b>done anything. </b>Meanwhile, Rabbi Yosei maintains that a peace-offering is one’s personal property, and therefore if one sells it the sale is valid.", 
            "Nevertheless, <b>now that Rabbi Oshaya has</b><b> established that </b>mishna as referring <b>to one who registers a</b><b> prostitute for his Paschal lamb, and </b>he established that <b>it</b><b> is </b>in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi, <b>learn from it that </b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds that </b><b>even with regard to one’s Paschal lamb, a person </b><b>restricts </b>its consecration. Should someone wish to purchase a portion of it, he will be able to do so. In such a case, from the outset that portion was not considered consecrated. This will answer the question raised by Ulla as to how the sanctity of the money can be transferred to a Paschal lamb that was already consecrated. In such a case, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, one does not fully consecrate the animal from the outset. Therefore, the animal is considered non-sacred for this purpose, and the sanctity may be transferred from the money to the animal.", 
            "<b>What is </b>this teaching of <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> that Abaye alluded to? Rabbi Oshaya’s teaching concerns the following mishna in <i>Temura</i>: As <b>we learned </b>in a mishna: If <b>one gave </b>animals <b>consecrated </b>as offerings <b>for </b>a prostitute’s <b>payment, they are </b>nevertheless <b>permitted </b>to be sacrificed. Although generally, animals given to a prostitute as payment are disqualified for use as offerings, this disqualification does not apply to an animal that was consecrated beforehand.", 
            "However, if one gave her <b>birds </b>that were <b>non-sacred, they are prohibited </b>for use as an offering.

If </b><b>consecrated </b>animals, for <b>which a blemish disqualifies them </b>for use, may nevertheless be used as an offering, since the status of a prostitute’s <b>payment </b>or the status of a dog’s <b>price does not take effect upon them, </b>then with regard to <b>birds, </b>for <b>which a blemish does not </b><b>disqualify them </b>for use as an offering, <b>is it </b><b>not </b>logically <b>right that </b>the status of a prostitute’s <b>payment </b>or a dog’s <b>price should not take effect </b><b>upon them? </b>In repudiation of this argument, <b>the verse states: </b>“You shall not bring the payment of a prostitute, or the price of a dog, into the House of the Lord your God <b>for any vow” </b>(Deuteronomy 23:19). A derivation is made from the extraneous phrase “for any vow” <b>to include birds, </b>which may be brought as vows.", 
            "The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that expands the argument made in the mishna and suggests that the opposite argument can also be made: <b>From now, </b>since it is known that birds used as a prostitute’s payment are disqualified, the following <b><i>a</i></b> <b><i>fortiori</i></b><b> inference </b>can be made to disqualify an animal already <b>consecrated: Just as </b>with regard to <b>birds, </b>for <b>which a</b><b> blemish does not disqualify them, </b>the status of a prostitute’s <b>payment and </b>a dog’s <b>price takes effect upon</b><b> them, </b>so too, with regard to animals <b>consecrated </b>as offerings, for <b>which a blemish does disqualify them, is it not</b> logically <b>right that </b>the status of a prostitute’s <b>payment</b><b> and </b>a dog’s <b>price should take effect upon them</b><b>? </b>In repudiation of this argument, <b>the verse states: “For </b><b>any vow,” </b>indicating that the disqualification applies to everything <b>except </b><b>for </b>something that has <b>already been vowed </b>to be offered and consecrated for that purpose.", 
            "The Gemara analyzes the assumption of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>But the </b>only <b>reason </b>consecrated animals are disqualified <b>is that the Torah writes </b>the word <b>vow; but if not for that I would have said </b>that even with regard to <b>consecrated </b>animals, <b>the prohibition of </b><b>a </b>prostitute’s <b>payment takes effect upon them. </b>The Gemara questions this assumption: <b>But </b>there is the following established principle: <b>A person cannot make forbidden something that is not his. </b>A consecrated animal is considered to be the property of the Temple and no longer of the individual who consecrated it. If so, how can one make it forbidden by giving it to a prostitute?", 
            "<b>Rabbi Oshaya said: </b>The mishna and <i>baraita</i> are referring <b>to one who registers a prostitute </b><b>for his Paschal lamb, </b>giving her a portion in it as payment for her services, <b>and </b>the <i>mishna</i> <i>and</i> <i>baraita</i> <b>are </b>in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that a Paschal lamb is considered a person’s personal property for the purposes of allowing additional people to register for it.", 
            "<b>What is </b>this teaching of <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi that Abaye alluded to? <b>As it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if the household be too little for a lamb,</b> then shall he and his neighbor next to his house take one” (Exodus 12:4). The phrase “if the household be too little” is taken to mean the household cannot afford the basic necessities of the Festival. Continuing this interpretation, the phrase “for a lamb [<i>miheyot</i> <i>miseh</i>]” is then taken to mean: <b>sustain him [</b><b><i>haḥayeihu</i></b><b>] from the lamb, </b>i.e., he may use the Paschal lamb as a means of supporting himself.

            "<b>The Rabbis hold that this is </b>considered <b>a different eating, </b>not directly related to the Paschal lamb.

If, by Torah law, one who is ritually impure due to contact with a creeping animal is fit to have an offering brought on his behalf, how then can he tip the balance of the entire community such that the majority is considered ritually impure and unfit to bring the Paschal lamb in purity?",

            "<b>So too, it is reasonable </b>to establish the mishna as referring to a <i>zav</i> who had already immersed, <b>from </b>the fact <b>that the last clause </b>of the mishna <b>taught: </b>With regard to a <i>zav</i> who <b>saw three sightings, one slaughters </b>the Paschal lamb <b>on his </b><b>behalf on the eighth </b>day. <b>Granted, if you say </b>that the first clause, which states: With regard to <b>a </b><b><i>zav</i></b> <b>who saw two sightings, one slaughters on his behalf on </b><b>the seventh day, </b>is referring to a case in which <b>he </b>had already <b>immersed, </b>then it is <b>necessary </b>to teach the last clause for the following reason:",

            "<b>With regard to what </b><b>do they disagree? </b>The Gemara explains that they disagree about how to interpret the various verses that refer to the first and second <i>Pesaḥ</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds </b>that the use of the word souls in the verse: <b>“According to the</b><b> number of the souls</b>…you shall make your count for the lamb” (Exodus 12:4), includes everyone, <b>and even women, </b>in the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>. <b>And if you say </b>that <b>if</b><b> so, even on the second </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>, women should <b>also </b>be included, but <b>it is written </b>with regard to one who had not offered a Paschal lamb on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> and then neglected to bring one on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>: <b>“That man shall bear his sin” </b>(Numbers 9:13), which indicates that <b>a man, yes, </b>he is liable for not having brought a Paschal lamb on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, but <b>a woman, no, </b>she is not liable.",

The verse compares the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> to the second, and it is therefore <b>effective </b>to enable women to be included in a group in <b>a merely ancillary </b>manner.", 
            "<b>And Rabbi Yosei, what is the</b><b> reason </b>for his opinion? <b>As it is written </b>with regard to the <b>first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>: <b>“According to the number of</b><b> the souls,” </b>which includes <b>even a woman.

The word <b>soul </b>includes <b>even women. But </b>if so, the conclusion of that verse, which states: <b>“That man shall bear</b><b> his sin,” </b>which appears to emphasize that specifically a man is liable for not participating in the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, is there <b>to exclude what </b>case? It is there <b>to exclude</b><b> a minor </b>who did not participate in the Paschal lamb <b>from </b>the punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b><b>.</b>", 
            "<b>And </b><b>Rabbi Shimon, </b>what is the reason for his opinion? <b>It</b><b> is written </b>in a verse concerning the <b>first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>“</b><b>man.” </b>This teaches that <b>a man, yes, </b>a Paschal lamb may be brought on his behalf alone, but <b>a woman</b><b>, no. And if you say </b>that <b>if so, </b>a woman should be totally excluded from participating <b>even </b>in a group in an <b>ancillary </b>manner, this is not correct, because the verse states: <b>“According to the number of the souls,” </b>which certainly includes women, and it is therefore <b>effective </b>to enable women to be included in a group in <b>an </b><b>ancillary </b>manner.",

            "The Gemara adds that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Natan <b>follow their </b>line of <b>reasoning </b>as demonstrated by another dispute between them, which is related to the dispute quoted above. <b>As it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A convert who</b><b> converted </b>during the month <b>between the </b>offering of the <b>two</b><b> Paschal lambs </b>on the first and second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>and </b><b>similarly, a minor who grew up </b>and became obligated in mitzvot during the month <b>between the </b>offering of the <b>two </b><b>Paschal lambs, is obligated to observe the second </b><b><i>Pesaḥ</i></b><b>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Natan</b><b> says: Whoever needs </b>to observe <b>the first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>needs </b>to observe <b>the second; whoever does not need </b>to observe <b>the first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>, e.g., one who is a minor or is not yet Jewish, <b>does not need </b>to observe <b>the second </b><i>Pesaḥ</i> either.", 
            "The Gemara explains: <b>With regard </b><b>to what do they disagree?

            "Conversely, <b>Rabbi Natan holds </b>that <b>the second </b><i>Pesa</i><i>ḥ</i> <b>is </b>merely <b>a redress for the first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>, such that if one was obligated to bring the Paschal lamb on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> and did not, he may do so on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>; however, <b>it does </b><b>not repair the </b>failure to bring the Paschal lamb on <b>the first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>.

However, if one unwittingly failed to sacrifice the Paschal lamb on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>, he is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> even if he intentionally refrained from observing the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.", 
            "<b>And Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya held: The second </b><i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>repairs the </b>failure to offer the Paschal lamb on the <b>first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>.

            "<b>And </b>all <b>three of them expounded the same</b><b> verse </b>to derive their opinions: <b>“But the man who </b><b>is ritually pure, and is not on a journey, </b>and refrains from offering the Paschal lamb, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because [<i>ki</i>] he did not bring the offering of the Lord in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin” (Numbers 9:13). <b>Rabbi </b>Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds </b>that the verse should be understood as follows: The phrase: <b>“And refrains from </b><b>offering the Paschal lamb, </b>that soul <b>shall be cut off,” </b>means <b>that he did not participate </b>in the offering on <b>the first </b><i>Pesaḥ</i>. In the continuation of the verse, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi understands the word <i>ki</i> to mean: If, as the word <i>ki</i> has various meanings, one of which is: If.

            "On the other hand, if the lost lamb is found <b>after </b>the <b>slaughter of the </b>replacement <b>Paschal lamb</b><b>, it </b>itself <b>is sacrificed as a peace-offering, and so</b><b> too, its substitute </b>is sacrificed, which explains the ruling that the substitute of a Paschal lamb is sacrificed as a peace-offering.", 
            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the explanation of Rabbi Akiva: If so, <b>let </b>the mishna <b>say </b>these <i>halakhot</i> more simply, as follows: <b>The Paschal lamb </b>itself <b>is sacrificed and </b><b>the Paschal lamb is not sacrificed. </b>According to Rabbi Akiva’s explanation, the same rule applies to both the lamb and its substitute. What additional point is Rabbi Yehoshua making by speaking about the substitute? The Gemara answers: <b>This </b>comes to <b>teach us </b>through this formulation <b>that there is a </b>case of a <b>substitute Paschal lamb that is not sacrificed. </b>One might have thought that a substitute Paschal lamb is always treated as a peace-offering, even when it was substituted before the time of the slaughter; therefore, the mishna states that there is an instance in which it cannot be sacrificed because it is a substitute for a Paschal lamb that itself cannot be sacrificed.", 
            "<b>It was stated </b>that there was a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> about the proper text of the mishna. <b>Rabba </b><b>said: We learned </b>the opinion of Rabbi Akiva in the mishna as referring to the distinction of whether the lamb is found <b>before </b>the <b>slaughter </b>of the replacement lamb <b>or </b><b>after </b>the <b>slaughter </b>of the replacement lamb. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: </b><b>We learned </b>that it depends upon whether it is found <b>before midday or after midday. </b>Midday is the time that determines the status of an animal as a Paschal lamb; therefore, if the lamb is found after midday, even if it is found before the slaughter of the replacement Paschal lamb, its identity as a Paschal lamb is not firmly established and it may be sacrificed as a peace-offering.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>according <b>to Rabbi Zeira, </b><b>isn’t </b>the mishna <b>teaching </b>explicitly that it depends upon whether the lamb is found <b>before the slaughter of the </b>replacement <b>Paschal lamb? </b>How can he disagree with the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>Say </b>that according to Rabbi Zeira, the mishna must be interpreted as referring not to the act of the slaughter itself but to a lamb that is found <b>before the </b>earliest <b>time </b>for the <b>slaughter of the </b><b>Paschal lamb, </b>which is midday.", 
            "The Gemara notes that this dispute among the <i>amora’</i><i>im</i> <b>is like </b>the following dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in a mishna: <b>The Paschal lamb that is found before the</b><b> slaughter </b>of its substitute <b>shall be left to graze </b>until it becomes unfit; it is then sold, and the proceeds are used to purchase an animal that will be sacrificed as a peace-offering. If it is found <b>after the</b><b> slaughter, it </b>itself <b>is to be sacrificed </b>as a peace-offering. This is parallel to the explanation of Rabba. <b>Rabbi</b><b> Eliezer says </b>that if it is found <b>before midday it</b><b> shall be left to graze, </b>but if it is found <b>after midday it is to be sacrificed </b>as a peace-offering, which is parallel to the explanation of Rabbi Zeira.",

A firstborn animal may be eaten for two days and one night while a Paschal lamb must be eaten in one night; therefore, eating the firstborn animals according to the strictures of the Paschal lamb will cause them to be disqualified and burned once morning arrives, despite the fact that they are not actually disqualified yet.",

Rabbi <b>sent him </b>the following response: <b>This </b>is what <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, </b><b>said, who said </b>it <b>in the name of his father, </b><b>who </b>himself <b>said </b>it <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua </b><b>ben Ḥananya: </b>The proper order of the blessings is <b><i>nun</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>heh</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>yod</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>kuf</i></b><b>:</b> Candle [<i>ner</i>], wine [<i>yayin</i>], <i>havdala</i>, and <i>kiddush</i>.", 
            "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said </b>that the following <b>parable </b>serves to explain the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: </b>This is comparable <b>to a king who is exiting </b>a city <b>and</b><b> a governor is entering. </b>Etiquette dictates that the inhabitants of the city first <b>escort the king </b>out of the city to take leave of him in a dignified fashion, <b>and</b><b> afterward they go out to greet the governor. </b>Similarly, one should first recite <i>havdala</i>, to take leave of Shabbat, and only then recite <i>kiddush</i> over the Festival, whose sanctity is lesser than that of Shabbat.", 
            "The Gemara asks: <b>What </b>halakhic conclusion <b>was reached about</b> this matter? What is the proper order of the blessings? The <i>amora’im</i> accept Rav’s opinion that one should recite <i>kiddush</i> before <i>havdala</i>; however, they disagree about the blessing of time, which is generally relevant in such cases and which Rav did not address. <b>Abaye said </b>that the proper order is <b><i>yod</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>kuf</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>zayin</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>nun</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>heh</i></b><b>: </b>The blessing over wine [<i>yayin</i>], <i>kiddush</i>, the blessing for time [<i>zeman</i>], the blessing over the candle [<i>ner</i>], and <i>havdala</i>. <b>And Rava said </b>the order is <b><i>yod</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>kuf</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>nun</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>heh</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>zayin</i></b><b>: </b>Wine [<i>yayin</i>], <i>k</i><i>iddush</i>, candle [<i>ner</i>], <i>havdala</i>, and time [<i>zeman</i>]. The Gemara concludes: <b>And </b>the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>Rava</b><b>.</b>", 
            "With regard to this issue of <i>havdala</i>, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda happened to </b>come to <b>the house of Rava. </b>After Shabbat, <b>they brought before them</b><b> a light and spices. Rava recited the blessing over the</b><b> spices first and then </b>the blessing <b>over the light. </b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda <b>said to him: But both Beit Shammai</b><b> and Beit Hillel, </b>who dispute the order of the blessings at <i>havdala</i>, agree that the blessing over <b>light is first</b><b>, and </b>only <b>then </b>comes the blessing <b>over the spices.</b>", 
            "<b>And what is this; </b>what is the source for the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Beit Shammai say </b>that with regard to one who is required to say Grace after Meals and <i>havdala</i>, and he has only one cup of wine, the proper order of the blessings is: The blessing over the <b>candle, and </b>the blessing of Grace After <b>Meals, </b>followed by the blessing over the <b>spices, and </b>finally <b><i>havdala</i></b><b>. And Beit</b><b> Hillel say: </b>The blessing over the <b>candle </b>comes first, <b>and </b>then the blessing over the <b>spices, and </b>afterward the blessing of Grace After <b>Meals, and </b>last is <b><i>havdala</i></b><b>. </b>Both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that the blessing over the candle is recited before <i>havdala</i>.", 
            "<b>Rava answered after him and said: This </b>mishna is <b>the</b><b> statement of Rabbi Meir. However, Rabbi Yehuda says: Beit Shammai</b><b> and Beit Hillel did not disagree over </b>Grace After <b>Meals</b><b>, as </b>everyone concurs that <b>it is </b>recited <b>first, nor </b>did they disagree <b>over </b><b><i>havdala</i></b><b>, as it is </b>recited <b>last.</b>", 
            "<b>With regard to what did they disagree? </b>They disagreed over the blessings recited in the middle of <i>havdala</i>, i.e., the blessings <b>over light and over the spices</b><b>.</b><b> Beit Shammai say: Light </b>first, <b>and spices thereafter; </b><b>and Beit Hillel say: Spices </b>first, <b>and light thereafter.

            "The Gemara relates another incident with regard to establishing meals and reciting blessings. <b>Rav Ya’akov bar </b><b>Abba happened to </b>come to <b>Rava’s house </b>for a Shabbat meal. <b>He saw that </b>Rava <b>recited </b>the blessing: <b>Who </b><b>creates the fruit of the vine, over the first cup </b>of wine he drank at the meal, <b>and then he </b><b>recited </b>the same <b>blessing upon the cup of </b>wine he used for the <b>blessing </b>of Grace after Meals <b>and drank </b>it. <b>He said to him: Why do you </b>have to say <b>all this, </b>i.e., why is it necessary to recite a second blessing? <b>The Master has recited a </b><b>blessing for us once </b>already, at the beginning of the meal, and thereby exempted us from a blessing on all the wine drunk during the meal. Rava <b>said to him: </b><b>When we were in the house of the Exilarch, this </b><b>was our practice. </b>It was the custom among the Sages to recite two blessings.", 
            "<b>He said to </b><b>him: </b>It works out <b>well to act this way </b>in <b>the house of the Exilarch, as there is uncertainty </b>as to whether <b>he will bring us </b>another cup of wine to drink, <b>or whether he will not bring us </b>another cup. Since we are dependent upon the host and cannot anticipate in advance whether we will drink more wine, each cup requires its own blessing. <b>Here, </b>however, <b>the cup is</b><b> resting before us and our attention is on it, </b>i.e., we intend to drink this wine after Grace after Meals. What need is there to recite another blessing? <b>He</b><b> said to him: I acted in accordance with the </b>opinion of the <b>students of Rav, as Rav Beruna and Rav</b><b> Ḥananel, the students of Rav, were sitting </b>together <b>at </b><b>a meal, </b>"
        ], 
        [
            "and <b>Rav Yeiva the Elder stood over the</b><b>m</b> to serve them. <b>They said to him: Give us </b>a cup of wine <b>and we will recite the blessing</b><b>s</b> of Grace after Meals. <b>Ultimately, they </b>changed their mind and <b>said </b><b>to him: Give us </b>a cup of wine <b>and we </b><b>will drink </b>it. <b>He said to them </b>that <b>Rav said</b><b> as follows: Since you </b>have <b>said: Give us </b>a cup <b>and we will recite the blessings </b>of Grace after Meals, <b>it is prohibited for you to drin</b><b>k</b> any more. <b>What is the reason </b>for this? The reason is <b>that</b><b> you have diverted your attention </b>from drinking. Therefore, if you want to drink any more, you must recite the blessing over wine again.", 
            "The Gemara relates that <b>Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi were sitting at</b><b> a meal</b><b>,</b><b> and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava</b><b>, stood over them </b>to serve them. <b>Ameimar recited a blessing</b><b> over each and every cup </b>of wine he drank. <b>And</b><b> Mar Zutra recited a blessing over the first cup </b>he drank during the meal <b>and over the last cup </b>he drank, upon concluding Grace after Meals. <b>Rav Ashi recited</b><b> a blessing over the first cup and </b>did <b>not recite</b><b> any further blessings </b>over the subsequent cups he drank.", 
            "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rava said</b><b> to them: In accordance with whose </b>opinion should <b>we act</b> in this matter? We have witnessed three different courses of action. <b>Ameimar said: I </b>repeatedly <b>changed my mind. </b>In other words, the reason Ameimar recited a blessing over each cup was not because he maintains that it is always necessary to do so. Rather, he drank each cup with the intention that it should be his last. Consequently, he diverted his attention from drinking each time, and therefore he was required to recite a new blessing before he could drink again. <b>Mar Zutra said: I acted in accordance with the</b> opinion of the <b>students of Rav. </b>They maintain that one who prepares to recite Grace after Meals has completely diverted his attention from drinking, and therefore the blessing on wine that one recites during the meal does not include the wine he drinks after Grace after Meals.", 
            "<b>And Rav Ashi said: </b>The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in</b><b> accordance with </b>the opinion of <b>the students of Rav. </b>This can be proven from a ruling of Rav himself, <b>as</b> with regard to <b>a Festival that occurs after Shabbat, Rav</b><b> said </b>that the order of blessings is <b><i>yod</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>kuf</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>nun</i></b><b>, </b><b><i>heh</i></b><b>: </b>Wine [ <i>yayin</i>], <i>kiddush</i>, candle [<i>ner</i>], and <i>havdala</i>. This shows that although one recites <i>kiddush</i> between the blessing over wine and <i>havdala</i>, it is unnecessary to recite the blessing over wine again before <i>havdala</i>. The same should hold true in our case: Just as <i>kiddush</i> is not considered an interruption between the blessing over wine and its consumption, Grace after Meals should not be considered an interruption either.", 
            "The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <b>And that is not so. There, </b>when one is preparing himself to recite Grace after Meals, he has already <b>uprooted his min</b><b>d</b><b> from drinking. Here, </b>with regard to <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdala</i>, <b>he has not uprooted his mind</b><b> from drinking.</b>", 
            "After discussing the opinion of the students of Rav, the Gemara returns to the story of Rav Ya’akov bar Abba’s visit to Rava. <b>When </b>the time <b>came to recite </b><b><i>havdala</i></b><b>, </b>Rava’s <b>attendant got up and lit a torch from</b><b> a candle. </b>Rav Ya’akov bar Abba <b>said to him</b><b>: Why do you </b>need <b>all this?

Rav Ya’akov bar Abba <b>said to him: If he </b><b>had not heard it from the Master he would not </b><b>have done it </b>on his own; he must have been following your opinion on this matter.

            "Rava <b>began </b>his recitation of <i>havdala</i> <b>and said: Who distinguishes</b><b> between sacred and profane, between light and darkness, between Israel</b><b> and the nations, between the seventh day and the six</b><b> days of work</b><b>.</b> Rav Ya’akov bar Abba <b>said</b><b> to him: Why do you </b>need <b>all this?

            "<b>But the Master did not </b><b>say three </b>distinctions, <b>nor did he say seven</b><b>,</b> as he actually mentioned four distinctions. <b>He said to him: In</b><b> truth, </b>that is inaccurate, as the distinction <b>between the seventh</b><b> day and the six days of work </b>is not considered a separate statement of distinction.

            "With regard to the previously cited dispute, the Gemara asks: <b>What is </b>the practical difference <b>between them? </b>Since the beginning and end of a blessing generally address the same topic, what is the difference between these two opinions?

            "<b>The one who said </b>that one must mention an expression <b>similar to </b>the <b>beginnings </b>of blessings <b>near their conclusions </b>would say that one is <b>not</b><b> required to say: Between the sanctity of Shabbat and the</b><b> sanctity of the Festival You have distinguished, </b>before concluding the blessing, as the beginning of the blessing refers simply to the sacred and the profane. <b>And </b>according to <b>the one</b><b> who said </b>that one must say a phrase <b>similar to</b> the <b>conclusions </b>of blessings <b>near their conclusions, </b>one is <b>required</b><b> to say: Between the sanctity of Shabbat and the sanctity</b><b> of the Festival You have distinguished.</b>", 
            "The Gemara returns to the aforementioned matter <b>itself.

In other words, as Rav Sheshet maintained that the reason one may not eat on Passover eve is to prevent him from being distracted from preparing the Paschal lamb, and he also maintained that the Paschal offering may be sacrificed during the entire day of the fourteenth of Nisan, therefore, he would not eat that entire day.", 
            "<b>They say </b>in response to this suggested interpretation of Rav Sheshet’s practice: <b>No, </b>it is by no means clear that this was his reasoning. <b>Rav Sheshet was different, </b><b>as he was delicate [</b><b><i>istenis</i></b><b>]</b><b>,</b><b> for if he would </b><b>taste some </b>food <b>in the morning, </b>the <b>food </b>he ate <b>at night would not be effective for him. </b>He would therefore fast the whole day so that he could eat <i>matza</i> at night with a hearty appetite.",

Likewise, <b>Rav Ashi said: I saw Rav Ḥananya bar Beivai </b>follow this policy: <b>Upon </b>drinking <b>each cup, he would leave </b>the house <b>and view the marketplace.</b>", 
            "<b>And we said </b>that there is concern for the safety of one who drinks in pairs <b>only </b>when he intends <b>to set out on the </b><b>road </b>after drinking, <b>but </b>if he intends to remain <b>in </b><b>his home </b>there is <b>no </b>need for concern. <b>Rabbi Zeira </b><b>said: And </b>one who plans <b>to sleep is comparable to </b>one who is <b>setting out on the road</b><b>.</b> He should be concerned that he might be harmed. The Gemara asks: <b>And </b>if one intends to remain <b>in his home, </b>is there <b>no </b>cause for concern? <b>But Rava would count </b><b>the beams </b>of the house to keep track of the number of cups he had drunk so as to ensure that he would not consume an even number.", 
            "<b>And </b>likewise <b>Abaye, when he would drink one cup, </b><b>his mother would </b>immediately <b>place two cups in his two </b><b>hands </b>so that he would not inadvertently drink only one more cup and thereby expose himself to the danger of drinking in pairs. <b>And </b>similarly, <b>when Rav Naḥman bar </b><b>Yitzḥak would drink two cups, his attendant would </b>immediately <b>place one </b>more <b>cup in his hand, </b>and if he would drink <b>one cup, </b>the attendant would <b>place two cups </b><b>in his two hands. </b>These reports indicate that one should be concerned for his safety after drinking an even number of cups, even when he remains at home. The Gemara answers: <b>An important person is different. </b>The demons focus their attention on him, and he must therefore be more careful than the average person.", 
            "<b>Ulla said: Ten cups contain no </b><b>element of </b>the danger associated with <b>pairs. Ulla </b>rules here <b>in accordance with his reasoning </b>stated elsewhere, <b>as Ulla said, </b><b>and some say it was taught in a </b><b><i>baraita</i></b><b>: The </b><b>Sages instituted </b>that one must drink <b>ten cups </b>of wine <b>in the house of a mourne</b><b>r</b> during the meal of comfort. <b>And if it could enter your mind </b>that <b>ten</b><b> cups do contain the element of </b>danger associated with <b>pairs</b><b>, how could the Sages arise and institute something that </b>might <b>bring a person to </b>a state of <b>danger? However, eight</b><b> cups do contain the element of </b>danger associated with <b>pairs</b><b>.</b>", 
            "<b>Rav Ḥ</b><b>isda and Rabba bar Rav Huna both say </b>that eight is also safe from the dangers of pairs, as the number seven, represented by the word <b><i>shalom</i></b><b>, combines </b>with the previous cups <b>for the good </b>but <b>does not combine for </b><b>the bad. </b>The final verse of the priestly benediction reads: “The Lord lift His countenance upon you and give you peace [<i>shalom</i>]” (Numbers 6:26). The word <i>shalom</i>, the seventh Hebrew word in this verse, has a purely positive connotation. Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna therefore maintain that the seventh cup combines with the previous six only for good purposes. After the seventh cup, i.e., from the eighth cup and on, the cups constitute pairs for the good but not for the bad. <b>However, six cups do </b><b>contain the element of </b>danger associated with <b>pairs.</b>", 
            "<b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say </b>that even drinking six cups is not dangerous. The reason is that the fifth cup, represented by the word <b><i>viḥuneka</i></b> in the second verse of the priestly benediction: “The Lord make His face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you [<i>viḥuneka</i>]” (Numbers 6:25), <b>combines </b>with the previous cups <b>for </b><b>the good </b>but <b>does not combine for the bad.

            "<b>Abaye and Rava both say </b>that even the number four is not dangerous, as <b><i>veyishmerekha</i></b><b>, </b>the third word in the first verse of the priestly benediction, reads: “The Lord bless you and keep you [<i>veyishmerekha</i>]” (Numbers 6:24). <b>It combines for the good </b>but <b>does not </b><b>combine for the bad.</b>", 
            "<b>And Rava follows his </b>standard line of <b>reasoning </b>in this regard, <b>as Rava </b>allowed <b>the</b><b> Sages to leave </b>after having drunk <b>fou</b><b>r</b><b> cups </b>and was not concerned for their safety. <b>Although Rava bar Livai </b><b>was injured </b>on one such occasion, Rava <b>was not concerned </b>that <b>the matter </b>had been caused by his consumption of an even number of cups, <b>as he said: That </b>injury occurred <b>because </b>Rava bar Livai <b>challenged me during the </b>public <b>lecture</b><b>.</b> It is improper for a student to raise difficulties against his rabbi during a public lecture, lest the rabbi be embarrassed by his inability to answer.",

However, if there is more of the stringent material, the two substances do not combine halakhically to form the amount of the smaller requisite size.

The point is that the Jews would not have chanted: “They who make them shall be like them” (Psalms 115:8) at a time that they were worshipping idols.

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And why is </b>this section <b>called the great </b><b><i>hallel</i></b><b>? </b><b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because </b>this passage states that <b>the </b><b>Holy One, Blessed be He, sits in the heights of </b><b>the universe and dispenses food to every creature. </b>The whole world praises God for His kindness through the great <i>hallel</i>, which includes the verse: “Who gives food to all flesh” (Psalms 136:25).",

            "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rava, </b>who maintains that it is a mitzva from the Torah to eat <i>matza</i> nowadays, how could he respond to that interpretation of the verse?

            "<b>Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya</b><b>,</b><b> as it was taught </b>in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse <b>“And they shall eat of the </b><b>meat on that night” </b>(Exodus 12:8), <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya</b><b> says: Here it is stated “on that night,” </b>from which it cannot be determined when the night ends. <b>And below</b><b> it is stated: “And I will pass through the land</b><b> of Egypt on that night </b>and I will strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:12).

This verse indicates that the Paschal lamb may be eaten <b>until the time of haste, </b>i.e., until dawn, as the Jewish people left Egypt the next day.", 
            "Rabbi Akiva continues: <b>If </b>that is <b>so, what is </b>the meaning when <b>the verse states: “On </b>that <b>night,” </b>with regard to eating the Paschal lamb? The Gemara explains that this phrase is necessary, as I <b>might </b>have thought that the Paschal lamb <b>is eaten during the day, </b>like all other <b>offerings, </b>which must be slaughtered and eaten during the day. Therefore, the <b>verse states: “On </b>that <b>night,” </b>to underscore that this particular offering <b>is eaten at night, and it is</b><b> not eaten during the day.</b>",

            "The Gemara explains the previous statement. How could the Paschal lamb be eaten for two days and one night if one starts eating it at night? The Gemara explains: One may say: <b>I will substitute</b><b> the nights </b>that the Paschal lamb may be eaten <b>instead</b><b> of the days </b>that a peace-offering is eaten. <b>And</b> accordingly, the Paschal lamb may <b>be eaten for two nights</b><b> and one day. </b>Therefore, <b>the Torah wrote </b>the word <b>“</b><b>that,” </b>to teach that the Paschal lamb may be eaten only on that one night.",

If it is prohibited to leave any part of the Paschal lamb until the morning, it is certainly prohibited to leave any of it until the following night. Therefore, it is unnecessary to cite an additional source to teach that the Paschal lamb may be eaten only on the first night.", 
            "<b>And Rabbi Akiva </b>could have <b>said to you, </b>in response to this argument: <b>If the Torah hadn’t written </b>“on <b>that </b>night,” <b>I would have said: What is </b>indicated by the word <b>“morning” </b>in that verse?

One might therefore have thought that the <i>halakhot</i> of eating <i>matza</i> differ entirely from those of the Paschal lamb.
