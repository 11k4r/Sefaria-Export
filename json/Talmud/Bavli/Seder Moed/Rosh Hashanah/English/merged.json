Why is it necessary to set a specific date to count the years of a king’s rule, rather than counting them from the day that he ascends to the throne? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for </span>determining the validity of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">documents</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> ", 
            "It was the common practice to date documents in accordance with the years of the king’s rule; therefore, it was important that these years begin at a fixed time, so that one knows whether a particular document was antedated or postdated, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Antedated promissory notes, </span>i.e., promissory notes dated prior to the date on which the loan actually took place, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are invali</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> because a loan document creates a lien on the borrower’s property. By dating the document earlier than the loan itself, the lender has a fraudulent mortgage on the property, which can be used against any future purchaser. Therefore, the Sages ordained that an antedated promissory note does not establish a lien, even from the true date of the loan. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But postdated</span> promissory notes bearing a date that is later than the date when the loan actually took place <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are valid, </span>as postdating the note presents no opportunity for defrauding a purchaser.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Meir, </span>who says that one transgresses the prohibition against delaying as soon as one Festival has passed, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">what is the rationale </span>for his opinion?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Sheshet said </span>a different explanation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is </span>meant here by <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Paschal lamb? </span>It is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the peace-offering </span>that is brought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">in place of a Paschal lamb. </span>If a lamb that had been set aside to be sacrificed as a Paschal offering was lost, and its owner took another lamb and sacrificed that as his Paschal lamb, and afterward the first animal was found, it must now be brought as a peace-offering.

            "§ The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">From</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> where are these matters derived </span>that all the offerings and vows listed above in the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> are subject to the prohibition against delaying? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">As the Sages taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“When you shall vow a vow </span>to the Lord your God, you shall not delay paying it; for the Lord your God will surely require it from you, and it would be sin in you” (Deuteronomy 23:22).

            "The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What could he have done </span>with the remaining animal? If you say <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that he may sacrifice it and sacrifice </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the bread with it, </span>i.e., the forty loaves of bread that are brought as a meal-offering together with the animal component of the thanks-offering, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">perhaps this </span>animal <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is </span>not the one that had originally been set aside but rather <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the substitute, </span>and the rule is that the substitute is sacrificed like the thanks-offering itself, but without bread.

The verse warns one who takes a loan that incurring debt may result in one losing the very sheets that he sleeps on to his creditor.

Consequently, you might <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">say that </span>one’s <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">wife also dies </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for this transgression </span>of the prohibition: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">You shall not delay, </span>in that one fails to fulfill his commitment.

The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: Is it that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“When</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> you shall vow a vow </span>to the Lord your God, you shall not delay paying it” (Deuteronomy 23:22), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> this </span>one, the heir, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">did not make a vow? </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Or perhaps </span>the essence of the mitzva is as it says: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And there you shall come; and there you shall</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> bring </span>your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices” (Deuteronomy 12:5–6), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> this </span>one, the heir, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is obligated </span>to come and bring his father’s offerings.",

The words <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“it shall be a Jubilee</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">”</span> come to teach that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although they did not release </span>property to its original owners, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although they did not sound </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span>, it is nevertheless a Jubilee Year, and the <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the Jubilee year apply. One <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> they did not send </span>free the slaves it is also still a Jubilee Year. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Therefore, the verse states: “It shall</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> be,” </span>this being a term of limitation. This teaches that at least one of the essential <span class=\"it-text\">halakhot</span> of the year must be observed, and if not, it is not a Jubilee Year. This is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Yosei says: “It shall be a Jubilee</span> for you”; <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although they did not release </span>property to its original owners, and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">although they did not send </span>free the slaves, it is nevertheless a Jubilee Year.

In this case, the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> must be sounded, otherwise it is not a Jubilee Year.", 
            "Rabbi Yosei explains his position: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Since one verse includes </span>situations where the Jubilee is in force, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and another verse excludes </span>such situations, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">for what </span>reason <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do I say </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is a Jubilee Year although </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they did not send </span>free the slaves, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">but it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Jubilee Year only if they sounded </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span>?

The Gemara explains: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">The verse states: “And </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">you shall proclaim liberty [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">deror</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] throughout all the land </span>to all its inhabitants,” and immediately afterward it says: “It shall be a Jubilee for you.” <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">holds </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a verse may be expounded in reference to the </span>immediately <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">preceding clause, but not in reference to the clause before </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that. </span>Therefore, the exclusion implied by the words “it shall be,” is referring to what is stated in the immediately preceding clause: “And you shall proclaim liberty throughout all the land,” i.e., the emancipation of slaves. It is not referring to what is stated in the clause before that: “On Yom Kippur shall you sound the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> throughout all your land.”",

            "§ <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: Rice, millet, poppy</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and sesame that took root before</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Rosh HaShana are tithed in accordance with the outgoing </span>year, meaning that second tithe is set aside in the first, second, fourth, and fifth years of the Sabbatical cycle, and poor man’s tithe is set aside in the third and sixth years, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and they are permitted </span>even if the following year is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a Sabbatical Year.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba said: </span>Say that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Sages </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">said </span>that the tithe year of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a tree follows </span>the time of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the formation </span>of its fruit, that of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">grain and olives follows </span>the time that they reach <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one-</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">third </span>of their growth, and that of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">vegetables follows </span>the time of their <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">picking</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">.</span> The question may therefore be raised: With regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">these </span>crops, i.e., rice, millet, poppy, and sesame, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to what did the Sages equate </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">them</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">?</span> Their tithe year is determined neither by their formation, nor by the time when they reach one-third of their growth, nor by their picking.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabba then said: </span>The reason for their uniqueness with regard to tithing is that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">since </span>these crops do not ripen all at once, but rather, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they ripen </span>and are gathered <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">little by littl</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">e</span> over an extended period of time, if their year were to follow the time of their picking, people might set aside tithes from that which was picked before Rosh HaShana for that which was picked after Rosh HaShana. Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Sages </span>decreed that their tithe year <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">follows </span>the time of their <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taking root, </span>which is the same for the entire field.

An allusion may be found in Scripture for all of them: Giving <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">charity, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death”</span> (Proverbs 10:2); <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">crying out </span>in prayer, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is written</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: “Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> He brings them out of their distresses” </span>(Psalms 107:28); <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a change of </span>one’s <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">name, as it is written: </span>“As for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Sarai your wife, you shall not call her </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be” </span>(Genesis 17:15), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it is written </span>there: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And I will bless </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">her, and I will also give you a son from </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">her” </span>(Genesis 17:16); <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a change of </span>one’s <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">deeds </span>for the better, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is written: “And God saw their</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> deeds” </span>(Jonah 3:10), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it is written </span>there: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> God repented of the evil, which He had said He</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> would do to them, and He did not do </span>it” (Jonah 3:10).", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And some</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> say: Also, a change of </span>one’s <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">place </span>of residence cancels an evil judgment, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is written: “And the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Lord said to Abram: Go you out of your county</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">” </span>(Genesis 12:1), <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and afterward </span>it is written: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And I</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> will make of you a great nation” </span>(Genesis 12: 2).

            "The Gemara cites two more statements in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak, relating to the Festivals: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person is</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> obligated to </span>go out and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">greet his teacher on a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Festival</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> as it is stated </span>that the husband of the Shunamite woman asked, when she was readying herself to go to the prophet: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Why will you go to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">him today; it is neither the New Moon nor Shabbat”</span> (II Kings 4:23). <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">By inference, </span>we learn <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that on </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the New Moon and on Shabbat, </span>which in this context means a Festival that is a day of rest, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">she </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was required to go.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A person is obligated to </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">purify himself on a Festival</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> as it is stated: “</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And their carcasses you shall not touch; </span>they are impure to you” (Leviticus 11:8). This verse is referring to the Festivals, as taught in the following <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This is also </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught </span>in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And their carcass</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> you shall not touch.” </span>One <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">might </span>have thought <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>ordinary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Jews are prohibited from touching an animal carcass. </span>Therefore, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> verse states: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, </span>and say to them: There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people” (Leviticus 21:1). It is derived from here that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the sons of Aaron are prohibited </span>from defiling themselves, but <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the children of Israel, </span>i.e., non-priests, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are not prohibited </span>from doing so.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">But are </span>these <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">matters not an </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">a</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">fortiori</span> inference? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">If, </span>with regard to of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">severe impurity, </span>i.e., contact with a human corpse, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">priests are prohibited </span>from defiling themselves, while ordinary <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Israelites are not prohibited </span>from doing so, in the case of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">light impurity, </span>e.g., touching an animal carcass, is it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not all the more so </span>that Israelites be permitted to defile themselves? <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, what </span>is the meaning when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the verse states: “And their carcass you shall</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> not touch?” </span>It means that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">on a Festival </span>all are obligated to purify themselves.

            "§ The Gemara goes back to discuss the Day of Judgment. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Kruspeda</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">i</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">books are opened on Rosh HaShana </span>before the Holy One, Blessed be He: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">One of wholly wicked </span>people, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and one</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of wholly righteous </span>people, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and one of middling </span>people whose good and bad deeds are equally balanced. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Wholly righteous</span> people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are immediately written and sealed for life; wholly </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">wicked </span>people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are immediately written and sealed for death; </span>and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">middling </span>people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are left </span>with their judgment <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">suspended from Rosh </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">HaShana until Yom Kippur, </span>their fate remaining undecided. If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">merit, </span>through the good deeds and mitzvot that they perform during this period, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they are written for life; </span>if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">do not </span>so <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">merit, they are written for death.</span>",

            "§ <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Huna raised a contradiction</span> between the two halves of a verse. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">It is written</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">: “The Lord is righteous [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">tzaddik</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] in all His ways” </span>(Psalms 145:17), indicating that God acts in accordance with the attribute of strict justice [<span class=\"it-text\">tzedek</span>], <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is written </span>in the same verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“And kind [</span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">ḥasid</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">] in all His</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> works,” </span>implying that He acts with grace and loving-kindness [<span class=\"it-text\">ḥesed</span>], going beyond the letter of the law. Rav Huna explained: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Initially, </span>at the time of judgment, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">righteous, but in the end, </span>at the time of punishment, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">He is gracious.</span>", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabbi Elazar raised</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> a </span>similar <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">contradiction: It is written: “But to you, O</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Lord, belongs kindness” </span>(Psalms 62:13), implying that God acts beyond the letter of the law, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">written </span>in the same verse: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“For You render to a</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> man according to his deeds,” </span>implying that He rewards and punishes measure for measure.

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rav Yehuda said: A covenant </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was made with the thirteen attribute</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">s</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> that they will not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> return empty-handed, </span>meaning that if one mentions them, he will certainly be answered, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as it is stated </span>in this regard: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">“Behold, I make a covenant” </span>(Exodus 34:10).",

            "The Gemara <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">raises an objection </span>from a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>: If <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one repents in the meantime, </span>between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he is forgiven; </span>if <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">he does </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not repent in the meantime, </span>then <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">even if he </span>later <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">brings </span>as offerings <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">all the rams of Nebaioth in the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">world, </span>which are of the best quality, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">they do not</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> forgive him </span>in the Heavenly court. This implies that once one’s sentence has been decreed, even repentance cannot alter it. The Gemara answers: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">This </span>is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">not difficult: Here, </span>where repentance is effective only before the sentence on Yom Kippur, the <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span> is referring to repentance <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of an individual; </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there, </span>where forgiveness is granted even after a sentence is issued, it is referring to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">communal </span>repentance.",

Eating unleavened bread on Passover is an obligation only on the first night until midnight. After that time, it is optional. The verse states: “You shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty-first day of the month at the evening,” implying that it is not obligatory but optional to eat unleavened bread. Since the optional time of eating unleavened bread begins at midnight, after the conclusion of the obligatory time, the conclusion of that time is also at midnight on the twenty-first day.

This comes <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">to exclude </span>from the category of prohibited labors <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the sounding of the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">shofar</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> and the removal</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of brea</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">d</span> from the oven, each of <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">which is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a skill and not a labor, </span>and therefore they are not included in the category of prohibited labor. Apparently, sounding the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> is not prohibited by Torah law.", 
            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, Rava said: By Torah</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> law one is permitted </span>to sound the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> on Rosh HaShana even on Shabbat, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">and it was the Sages who</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> decreed </span>that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">it </span>is prohibited.

The Sages were concerned that one might carry the <span class=\"it-text\">lulav</span> or the Megilla four cubits in the public domain to take it to an expert who will teach him the proper manner to perform these mitzvot.

            "§ The mishna taught: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">After the Temple was destroyed, </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabban</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> Yoḥanan ben </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Zakkai instituted that </span>the people should sound the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span> even on Shabbat in every place where there is a court of twenty-three judges. The background to this decree is related in greater detail in a <span class=\"it-text\">baraita</span>, as <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the Sages </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">taught: Once Rosh HaShana occurred on Shabbat, and all the </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">cities gathered </span>at the Great Sanhedrin in Yavne for the Festival prayers. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to the sons </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">of Beteira</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> who were the leading halakhic authorities of the generation: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Let us sound </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">shofar</span>, as in the Temple. <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">They said to him: Let us discuss </span>whether or not this is permitted.",

            "The Gemara answers: The practical difference <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">between </span>the opinion of the first <span class=\"it-text\">tanna</span> and the opinion of the Rabbis who issued that last statement is with regard to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">a temporary court</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> i.e., one that is not fixed in a certain place.

            "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And from where do we </span>derive <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">one performs </span>actions in <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">commemoration of the Temple?

            "§ The mishna taught: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai also instituted <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>for <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the entire day</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> of waving </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> offering, eating the grain of the new crop <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">is prohibited. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">What is </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the reason </span>for this ordinance?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">And they</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> do not know that last year, </span>when <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there was no</span> <span class=\"gemarra-italic\">omer</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">, the eastern </span>horizon <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">illuminating, </span>i.e., the morning of the sixteenth of Nisan, served to <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permit </span>the consumption of the new grain immediately. However, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">now that </span>the Temple has been rebuilt and <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">there is an </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">omer</span> offering, it is <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">the </span><span class=\"gemarra-italic\">omer</span> that <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permits </span>the consumption of the new grain. When the Temple is standing, the new grain is not permitted until the <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> offering has been sacrificed. ", 
            "The Gemara clarifies: In this scenario, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">when </span>is it <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that </span>the Temple was <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">built?

            "<span class=\"gemarra-regular\">Rather, </span>you must say <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">that it was rebuilt on</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> the fifteenth </span>of Nisan or on some earlier date, in which case the new grain would not become permitted by the illumination of the eastern horizon. In that scenario, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\"> midday onward let it be permitted </span>to eat the new grain, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">as didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna in tractate <span class=\"it-text\">Menaḥot</span>: The people <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">distant </span>from Jerusalem, who are unaware of the precise time when the <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> was brought, <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">are </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">permitted </span>to eat the new grain <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">from midday onward</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">because the </span>members of the <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">court are not indolent with </span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">regard to </span>the <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> offering and would certainly have sacrificed it by midday. If so, now too, it should be permitted to eat the new grain beginning at that time. Why did Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai prohibit it for the entire day?", 
            "The Gemara answers: This ordinance <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was necessary only </span>in a case <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where </span>the Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was rebuilt on the fifteenth adjacent to sunset. Alternatively, </span>in a situation <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">where </span>the Temple <span class=\"gemarra-regular\">was rebuilt at night</span><span class=\"gemarra-regular\">,</span> on the evening of the sixteenth, and there was no opportunity to cut the <span class=\"it-text\">omer</span> that night. In either case there is insufficient time to complete all the preparations so that the offering can be sacrificed by noon the next day. If people eat the new grain at midday, they will have retroactively transgressed a prohibition.
