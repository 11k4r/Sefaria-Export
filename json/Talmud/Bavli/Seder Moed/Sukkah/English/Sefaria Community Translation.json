            "Mishnah: A sukkah that is taller than twenty <i>amos</i> is invalid. Rabbi Yehudah permits it.", 
            "Or if it is less than ten <i>tefachim</i> tall, or if it does not have (three) walls, or if it has more sunlight than shade, it is invalid.", 
            "Gemara: It is taught in a Mishnah there: A <i>mavoi</i> that is taller than twenty <i>amos</i> must be lowered. Rabbi Yehuda says: It is not necessary.", 
            "What is the difference between a sukkah, that was taught to be invalid, and a <i>mavoi</i>, that was taught to be repaired?", 
            "Sukkah is a Torah commandment, so it was taught to be invalid. <i>Mavoi</i> is a rabbinic commandment, so it was taught to be repaired.", 
            "And if you need, I could say: [In the case of a] Torah commandments it could have also been taught to repair it. Nonetheless, [the ruling for] sukkah (containing many statements), was given concisely, and taught that it is invalid. [The ruling for] <i>mavoi</i>, which does not contain many statements, taught to repair it.", 
            "From where are these words?", 
            "Rabbah said: As it says in the <i>Torah</i>: (Leviticus 23:43) \"In order that your generations will know that I settled the children of Israel in <i>sukkot</i>.\" Until twenty <i>amos</i>, a person knows that he is dwelling in a sukkah. Above twenty <i>amos</i>, a person does not know that he is dwelling in a sukkah, because it is not in his field of vision. ", 
            "Rabbi Zeira said: From here: (Isaiah 4:6) \"And a sukkah will be for shade from the Sun during the day.\" Until twenty <i>amah</i>, a person sits in the shade of a sukkah. Above twenty <i>amah</i>, a person does sit in the shade of the sukkah; rather, in the shade of its walls.", 
            "Abaye said to him: Rather, from that, whoever builds his sukkah in <i>Ashteroth Karnayim</i>, this also would not be a sukkah!", 
            "He said to him: There, remove <i>Ashteroth Karnayim</i>, and there is shade from the sukkah. Here, remove the walls, and there is no shade from the sukkah.", 
            "And Rabbah says: From here: (Leviticus 23:42) \"In sukkahs you will sit for seven days.\" The Torah said, For all seven days, leave from a permanent dwelling and dwell in a temporary dwelling. Until twenty <i>amah</i>, a person builds a dwelling as a temporary dwelling. Above twenty <i>amah</i>, a person does not build a dwelling as a temporary dwelling, rather as a permanent dwelling.", 
            "Abaye said to him: Rather, from that, someone who makes walls from iron and puts <i>sekhakh</i> on top, this also would not be a sukkah!", 
            "He said to him: This is what I said to you: Until twenty <i>amah</i>, when a person builds a dwelling, it is a temporary dwelling. If he built it as a permanent dwelling, he has still fulfilled [the <i>mitzvah</i>]. Above twenty <i>amah</i>, when a person builds a dwelling, it is a permanent dwelling. If he built it as a temporary dwelling, he has also not fulfilled [the <i>mitzvah</i>]."
