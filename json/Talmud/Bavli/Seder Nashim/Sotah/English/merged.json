            "SHOULD SHE HAVE ENTERED A PRIVATE PLACE WITH HIM AND STAYED WITH HIM A TIME SUFFICIENT FOR MISCONDUCT TO HAVE OCCURRED, SHE IS FORBIDDEN TO HER HUSBAND AND FORBIDDEN TO PARTAKE OF THE HEAVE-OFFERING. ", 
            "IF [HER HUSBAND] DIED, SHE PERFORMS THE CEREMONY OF HALIZAH BUT CANNOT CONTRACT A LEVIRATE MARRIAGE. ", 
            "[Gemarah]  Now that the Tanna has finished [Tractate] Nazir, what is his reason for continuing with [Tractate] Sotah? ", 
            "— It is according to the view of Rabbi; ", 
            "for it has been taught: ",

            "that whoever witnesses a suspected woman In her disgrace should withhold himself from wine. ", 
            "But [the Tanna in the Mishnah] should treat of [Tractate] Sotah first and afterwards that of Nazir! ", 
            "— Since he treated of [Tractate] Kethuboth [marriage-settlements] and dealt with the theme, ‘He who imposes in vow upon his wife’, he next treated of [Tractate] Nedarim [Vows]; and since he treated of [Tractate] Nedarim, he proceeded to treat of [Tractate] Nazir which is analogous to Nedarim, and then continues with Sotah for the reason given by Rabbi. ", 
            "IF ONE WARNS HIS WIFE. As an accomplished fact it is allowable, but as something still to be done it is not. ",
