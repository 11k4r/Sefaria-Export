He said to him: It is written in your Torah, you shall make you graven images. Why are you bathing in the bath of Aphrodite? He replied to him, we may not answer [questions relating to Torah] in a bath. When he came out, he said to him, I did not come into her domain, she has come into mine.

Meir; but the Sages declare: Any [Gentile] who takes upon himself the seven precepts which the sons of Noah undertook; and still others maintain: These do not come within the category of a ger toshav; but who is a ger toshav? A proselyte who eats of animals not ritually slaughtered, i.e., he took upon himself to observe all the precepts mentioned in the Torah apart from the prohibition of [eating the flesh of] animals not ritually slaughtered."
