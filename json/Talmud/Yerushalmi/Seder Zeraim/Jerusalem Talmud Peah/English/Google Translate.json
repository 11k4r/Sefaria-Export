From them Nathan gave back and added a tenth to ten If a man does not finish the wig, it is immeasurable that he should not have passed away, and he must pay the tithes of Rabbi Berkiah in particular, and why do not we produce ashes as a pervert? That he adds to them and that in doing them is a mitzva, even though he adds to them"
