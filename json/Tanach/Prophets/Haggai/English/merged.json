            "In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying:", 
            "’Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying: This people say: The time is not come, the time that the LORD’S house should be built.’", 
            "Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying:", 
            "’Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your cieled houses, while this house lieth waste?", 
            "Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.", 
            "Ye have sown much, and brought in little, Ye eat, but ye have not enough, Ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink, Ye clothe you, but there is none warm; And he that earneth wages earneth wages For a bag with holes.", 
            "Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.", 
            "Go up to the hill-country, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.", 
            "Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of My house that lieth waste, while ye run every man for his own house.", 
            "Therefore over you the heaven hath kept back, so that there is no dew, and the earth hath kept back her produce.", 
            "And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.’", 
            "Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, hearkened unto the voice of the LORD their God, and unto the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him; and the people did fear before the LORD.", 
            "Then spoke Haggai the LORD’S messenger in the LORD’S message unto the people, saying: ‘I am with you, saith the LORD.’", 
            "And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,",

            "In the seventh [month], on the twenty-first of the month, the word of the Lord came through Haggai the prophet, saying: ", 
            "Say now to Zerubbabel the son of Shaltiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak the High Priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying", 
            "Who among you is left, who saw this house in its former glory? And as you see it now, is it not as nothing in your eyes? ", 
            "And now, be strong, Zerubbabel, says the Lord; and be strong, Joshua the son of Jehozadak the High Priest; and be strong, all the people of the land, says the Lord. And (for I am with you, says the Lord of Hosts) do ", 
            "the thing that I set up with you when you left Egypt. And My spirit stands in your midst; fear not. ", 
            "For so said the Lord of Hosts: [There will rise] another one, and I will shake up the heaven and the earth and the sea and the dry land [for] a little while. ", 
            "And I will shake up all the nations, and they shall come [with] the precious things of all the nations. And I will fill this House with glory, said the Lord of Hosts. ",

            "\"Should a man carry contaminated flesh in the skirt of his garment, if it touches in his skirt the bread and the pottage and the wine and the oil, or any food, will it [the food] become contaminated?\" And the priests replied and said, \"No.\" ",

            "And Haggai replied and said, \"So is this people, and so is this nation before Me, says the Lord; and so is all the work of their hands, and whatever they sacrifice there is contaminated. ", 
            "And now, consider from this day and before-before placing a stone upon a stone in the Temple of the Lord ", 
            "so that they should not come to a heap of twenty measures, and there would be ten; [similarly,] when one would come to the wine-vat to draw off fifty press-measures, and there would be twenty. ", 
            "I smote you with blast and with yellowing and with hail in all the work of your hands, and you are not [returning] to Me, says the Lord. ",

            "The seed is still in the granary, and the grapevines, the fig trees, the pomegranate trees, and the olive trees have not yet borne [fruit]-from this day I will bless.\" ",

            "And I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots and their riders; and the horses and their riders shall come down, each one by the sword of his brother. ",
