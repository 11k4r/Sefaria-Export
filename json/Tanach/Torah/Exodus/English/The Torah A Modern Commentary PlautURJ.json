            "Then [God] said to Moses, \"Come up to Adonai, with Aaron Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders of Israel, and bow low from afar.", 
            "Moses alone shall come near Adonai; but the others shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him.\"", 
            "Moses went and repeated to the people all of God's commands and all the rules; and all the people answered with one voice, saying, \"All the things that God has commanded we will do!\"", 
            "Moses then wrote down all of God's commands. Early in the morning, he set up an altar at the foot of the mountain, with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.", 
            "He designated some young men among the Israelites, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed bulls as offerings of well-being to God.", 
            "Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he dashed against the altar.", 
            "Then he took the book of the covenant, and read it aloud to the people; and they said, \"All that Adonai has spoken will we do, and obey.\"", 
            "Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, \"This is the blood of the covenant, which Adonai now makes with you in agreement with all these words.\"", 
            "Then Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel ascended;", 
            "and they saw the God of Israel, under whose feet the likeness of a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very sky for purity.", 
            "Yet [God] did not raise a hand against the leaders of the Israelites; they beheld God, and they ate and drank.", 
            "And God said to Moses, \"Come up to Me on the mountain and be there; and I will give you the stone tablets with the teaching and the commandment which I have written, that you may teach them.\"", 
            "And Moses and his attendant Joshua arose, and Moses ascended the mountain of God.", 
            "To the elders he said, \"Remain here for us until we return to you. Aaron and Hur are with you; let anyone who has a legal matter approach them.\"", 
            "When Moses had ascended the mountain, the cloud covered the mountain.", 
            "The glory of God abode on Mount Sinai, and the cloud hid it for six days. On the seventh day God called to Moses from the midst of the cloud.", 
            "Now the Presence of God appeared to the Children of Israel as a consuming fire on the top of the mountain.", 
            "Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and ascended the mountain; and Moses remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights."
