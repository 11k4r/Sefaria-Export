            "And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said: ‘This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians.’ So it was named Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.", 
            "And his sons did as he commanded them.", 
            "For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a burial place, from Ephron the Hittite, in front of Mamre.", 
            "And Joseph returned to Egypt, he, and his brothers, and all who went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.", 
            "And when Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said: ‘Maybe Joseph will hate us, and will pay back all the evil which we did to him.’", 
            "And they sent a message to Joseph, saying: ‘Your father commanded before he died, saying:", 
            "You will say to Joseph: Please, forgive the transgression of your brothers, and their sin, for the evil that they did to you. And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.’ And Joseph wept when they spoke to him.", 
            "And his brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said: ‘We are your servants.’", 
            "And Joseph said to them: ‘Do not fear; am I in the place of God?", 
            "And as for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring about what has happened today, to keep many people alive.", 
            "So, do not fear; I will sustain you, and your little ones.’ And he comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.", 
            "And Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.", 
            "And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph’s knees.", 
            "And Joseph said to his brothers: ‘I die; but God will remember you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which He swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.’", 
            "And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying: ‘God will surely remember you, and you will carry up my bones from here.’", 
            "So Joseph died, being a hundred ten years old. And they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."
