            "The text of <b>mezuzot is not written on</b> parchment made of <b>skins of unclean</b> (i.e. non-kosher) <b>domestic animals or unclean wild animals, but it is written on</b> parchment made from <b>skins of dead</b> (i.e. not slaughtered in a way fit for eating) <b>or sick</b> (in a way that makes them unfit for eating) kosher animals. <b>And we are not concerned that perhaps the skins were pierced</b> at the animal’s heart.", 
            "<b>One must place the same size </b>margin <b>on all sides, as Rabbi Shimon Ben Elazar said.</b>", 
            "<b>If</b> the mezuzah parchment <b>was perforated in the location of the writing, it is invalid</b>; if <b>in an empty space, it is valid. If one wrote</b> the letter <b>vavs as zayins, zayins as vavs, regular</b> letters <b>as final ones, final ones as regular ones,</b> the paragraph separators <b>petucha as setuma, setuma as petucha, or if he mixed up its</b> other <b>letters or wrote them in</b> Paleo-<b>Hebrew</b> script, <b>it is invalid.</b>", 
            "<b>A storehouse for hay, a woodshed</b>, and <b>a</b> general <b>storehouse are exempt</b> from the requirement of mezuzah. <b>A cattle barn is exempt.

            "<b>An arched gateway is exempted</b> from a mezuzah. <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda obligate it, but they all agree that if</b> the gateway <b>is a straight wall below</b> for at least ten tefachim <b>and the arch is above</b> that, then the arch <b>requires a mezuzah.</b>",

            "<b>The mezuzah is written on</b> a scroll that is affixed on <b>the right side  at the entrance from the market to a gatehouse and at the exit from the courtyard to the gatehouse.</b>",

            "Regarding <b>a small room</b> similar to a gatehouse that serves as an entrance <b>to a large room, we affix</b> the mezuzah on the right <b>in order</b> of size <b>from small to large</b>, unlike a gatehouse. <b>If all</b> the doorways to the room are <b>frequently used, one places</b> a mezuzah <b>on all of them.</b>", 
            "<b>Regarding two rooms next to each other</b> with a doorway between them <b>we affix<b> the mezuzah on the right side <b>as one enters</b> further inside the house, i.e. from the outer room to the inner room. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: if there is a movable ladder to all four sides</b> we affix mezuzot to them.</b></b>",
