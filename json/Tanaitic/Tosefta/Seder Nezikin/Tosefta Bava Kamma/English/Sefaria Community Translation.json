            "3. There are seven thieveries. First - one who misrepresents [geneivat daat] themselves to others, one who insincerely invites another to their home, one who plies another with gifts they know they will not accept, one who impresses their guest by opening a barrel of wine already sold to a vendor, one who has improper measures, one who lies regarding weights, one who adulterates their merchandise... How do we know misrepresentation is theft? Because it says 'So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel' (II Samuel 15:6) "
