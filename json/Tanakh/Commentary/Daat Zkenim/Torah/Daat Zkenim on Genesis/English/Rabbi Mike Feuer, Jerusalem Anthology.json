                "And Abraham named that place – This is speaking of Mount Moriah. It is called that because it became a mountain out of fear (yirah) – at first it was a valley but it immediately became a high, steep, lofty mountain. Furthermore, it was originally called Shalem, as it says “Melchitzedek, king of Shalem…” (Bereshit 14:18) but Avraham called it yireh, therefore it is now called Yerushalayim which contains within it both yireh and Shalem.", 
                "The Lord will see – He called it ‘The Lord will see’ that my will and desire is to slaughter my son as He commanded me."
