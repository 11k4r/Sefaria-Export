                "\"For if they will say...\" Now, you may argue that the verse is still problematic; for how does the issue of the giving of the land connected to Torah's mitzvot? This is clear, since most of the Torah's mitzvot  are performed in conjunction with (the Jewish people's sovereignty or dwelling in) the land. Donations, tithes and construction of a temple must be done in the land. When Jewish people do not have the land they cannot fulfill these mitzvot at all.  ..."

The Re'em says that <i>hamazikin</i>, \"damagers,\" means demons. But this is an error, because here it is written, \"with every beast of the earth.\" Demons are not called <i>chayyot,</i> but rather are in the category of <i>kol chai,</i> \"all living things,\" as it is written (above, Bereishit 6:19 and Rashi ad loc.): \"from all the living things.\" And they are not called <i>chayyot</i>, \"beasts.\""
