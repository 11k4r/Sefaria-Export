It is in the plural, says the Seforno, to indicate that He is the ultimate eternal form from which all others derive. According to the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i>) and the <i>Beis Yosef</i> it signifies strength and domination. To the Ralbag it indicates that all things emanate from and are governed by Him. The Vilna Gaon agrees that it indicates governance, which is why it can be applied to lesser governing beings as well."
