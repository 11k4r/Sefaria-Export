                "I have already explained in Sefer HaYesod that it is possible to abbreviate words in any language e.g. donkey to donk'. Only the word \"no\" cannot be abbreviated because it will reverse the meaning. A great Spanish grammarian said [in this vein] that a \"heh\" is missing [here] and it should be \"for is a man like a tree of the field\" [as a rhetorical question.] (Note that a number of English translations actually render the phrase this way --Translator), but I do not find the notion compelling since what reason is there to say \"Do not destroy a fruit tree for it is not like a person to who can run away from you\" and according to my understanding we have no need for all this. [Rather] this is the explanation: \"for you shall eat from it but not cut it down for a man is as a tree of the field\" and similarly \"for he seizes a soul\" i.e. (in the case of seizing tools necessary for living as collateral, which is the verse cited --Translator) he is seizing things which preserve life. \"and do not cut it down\" [in our verse] is parsed along with \"to go before you in a seige,\" that is to say \"do not destroy a fruit tree, which provides life for people; it is only permitted for you to eat from it and not to cut it down to force the city into siege.\" Evidence that this is correct [comes from the phrase] \"thou shalt cut it down and build a siege [tower]\" [regarding non-fruit bearing trees]"
