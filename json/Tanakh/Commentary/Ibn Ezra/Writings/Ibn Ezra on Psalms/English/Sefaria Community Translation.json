                ". . .Kiss the son against his anointed; and behold the interpretation 'How pure and also how pure my insides' (Proverbs 31:2); and it is also written 'you are my son.' It is a custom in the nations of the world to place their hands under the hand of the king as the brother of Solomon or the slave under the thigh of his master or to kiss the king. This is the custom in India to this day."
