There is a pause between the words “the firstborn” and “Nadav” because it does not refer to Nadav who died without children, and there is no practical ramification of his being the firstborn. Rather, it refers to Aharon who was the firstborn ahead of Moshe."

There are 25 (<i>gematriya</i> of כה) letters in the verse of <i>Shema Yisrael.</i> The language of blessing and peace is used in the Torah 25 times. Therefore, the blessing of the <i>kohanim</i> begins with the language of blessing and concludes with peace. This is hinted at in the verse, “Hashem shall <b>bless</b> His people with <b>peace</b>” (Tehillim 29:11)."
