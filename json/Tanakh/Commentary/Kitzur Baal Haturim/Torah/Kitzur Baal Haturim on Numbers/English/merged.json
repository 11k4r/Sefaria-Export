There is a pause between the words “the firstborn” and “Nadav” because it does not refer to Nadav who died without children, and there is no practical ramification of his being the firstborn. Rather, it refers to Aharon who was the firstborn ahead of Moshe."

This is why the Priestly Blessing starts and finishes with the word peace and that is the meaning of \"The LORD will bless His people with peace.\" "
