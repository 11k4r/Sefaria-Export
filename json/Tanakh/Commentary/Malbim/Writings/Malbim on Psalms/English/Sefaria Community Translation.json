                "&lt;&lt;in progress=\"\"&gt;&gt; [The author] is coming to explain the conditions on account of which a person will be a \"Happy Person.\" There is a difference between a \"Happy Person\" and a \"Successful Person\": \"Success\" applies to worldly matters, [enjoyed] in life in this World; \"Happiness\" is in spiritual matters, [enjoyed] in the World to Come. Now, there are three areas of fulfillment, 1) fulfillment of acquisition, 2) fulfillment of the body, and 3) fulfillment of the soul. Therefore the Psalmist explains that here he is addressing the \"Happiness of Man\" [soleley] the \"Happiness\" that only man can attain, which is afforded by his being [at the level of] Man--not coupled with the \"Happiness\" which is afforded by being a living being (i.e. the fulfillment of acquisition or fulfillment of the body) which can also be found among animals. [In fact] we find various animals that attain their livelihood and sustenance more easily and swiftly then man; as the expression goes, \"there are none more wealthy than a pig.\" There are also animals which can accomplish can accomplish more than man is able to though use of the body, such as the elephant and the lion; and, in regards to the senses, an eagle, hawk through their faculty of sight. This is not the \"Happiness\" unique to a person; rather, [the \"Happiness of Man\"] is the fulfillment of refined character and spiritual qualities which can only be found achieved by man. The Psalmist explains that Man's happiness depends primarily on his being careful not to sin.", 
                "2-4: \"WHO DOES NOT WALK IN THE COUNSEL OF THE WICKED...\" There is a difference between \"the wicked\" and \"the sinners\": \"the wicked\" sin intentionally and rebelliously, whether in matters between man and the Omnipresent or in matters between man and his fellow. That is why the Psalmist said, \"the counsel of the wicked,\" because they are the ones who sin with counsel and inetntionality whereas in regards to the \"sinners\", it would not be right to say \"counsel\" since they do sin with counsel. The Psalmist adds further-", 
                "", 
                "", 
                "\"[THE \"HAPPY PERSON\"] DOES NOT STAND IN THE PATH OF THE \"SINNERS\" the \"sinners\" are the ones who sin from out of desire alone. Meaning to say that [in addition to not sinning like the \"wicked\"], the \"happy person\" also does not sin on account of their desires either. And not only does he not \"WALK on the path of the sinners\"--continuously sinning out of desire--but he does not even \"STAND on their path\"--even momentarily. The Psalmist adds further-"

Corresponding to this it says \"God is my salvation\" and so \"from whom shall I fear.\" And when a person fears from his enemies who are plotting evil against him secretly to destroy  his tree and its fruit [based on Jeremiah 11:19] and he does not know, this is called pahad, and corresponding to this it says afterwards"
