And do not go away from here, even among my fields (for Boaz had many fields), where the men might hate you. More so, stay close to my girls, because on this field there are men on one side, and women on another. Stay on the side of the women. "

That is, you shall have a husband as it is written, \"And rest is a woman in the house of a woman, who is better for you. A Torah observant and a mitzva that would not be better for her in the spiritual well, as Chazal says in the woman who bore the mukhsin and who tied the knot with him, and I will ask you to be better off in this rest in the true good:"
