[This is the case as well with] King Hezekiah who also ascribed these three ways of being as it is seen regarding Senacherib, King of Ashur, as it is written [regarding an orientation towards gifts]: \"And Hezekiah gave him all the money\" (2 Kings 18). And it is written [regarding an orientation towards war] \"And he gave the nation to the ministers of war\" (II Chronicles 32), and it is written [regarding an orientation towards prayer] \"And Hezekiah prayed before God\" (2 Kings 19). And thus we also need to go according to the directions of our ancestors and establish for ourselves a way of being to receive their faces [i.e. that follows in their ways] as gifts by way of refined speech; as prayer [by coming] before God the Exalted; however as war, it is impossible as it says \"I have sworn with you daughters of Jerusalem, etc.\" (Song of Songs 2). They have sworn not to arouse themselves to war with the nations.  "

The idea of this Midrash is that all the creation in their entirety were creation at their request and desire, and the Holy One B\"H informed them in the beginning of the creation all of their [related] matters and all that would befall them in the future. And also informed them of the days of their lives and deaths, and how they would occur. And how they would sustain themselves if with spirit or difficult, if independently or with the aid of others. And so our Rabbis have explained that all of the process of creation was performed with its knowledge and with its characters it was created, as it says \"and all his legions\", and they accepted and desired all; and accordingly they [the Rabbis] said 'he was apportioned to fall from the time of the six days of creation'. And Nevertheless their is a great punishment for those that [surround?], and so we make a guardrail on our roofs."
