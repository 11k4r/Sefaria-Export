                "Our sages of blessed memory said in Horayot:10, that being a King is work; You need to carry the burdens of  the nation, listen to them, and judge their cases in court whether you want to or not. If being a King is work, and the leprosy caused him to lived alone, then he was free from the work of being a king. Therefore, it was called a House of Freedom. Alternatively, the sages said this 'house of freedom' was a cemetery as it says in the verse (Psalms 88:6) \"...among the dead who are free\"."
