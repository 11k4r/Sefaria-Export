                "...Behold, Yehoshua son of Nun is referred to as the assistant of Moshe, to show that the reason that he merited prophecy was because he was Moshe's assistant. This is because through being Moshe's assistant, he was constantly with Moshe, to learn from his wisdom and behaviour. This is knowledge that a student who does not remain in the vicinity of their teacher to assist them does not acquire. This is why it says \"The mouth of Elisha son of Shafat, who poured water through Eliyahu\", this refers to what he taught, as serving and assisting a great person is more worthwhile than learning from them, as our Sages taught."
