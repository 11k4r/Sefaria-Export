                "(1) The sophisticated persons will understand that all the words of our Rabbis and their interpretations are solid and true. And this is what is said in Mas. Shabbat (63a), \"I was 18 years old, and I did not know that Scripture never departs from its straightforward meaning. Essentially, the laws and interpretations derive from superfluities in Scripture or from variations in language, where the plain sense of Scripture is written in language from which one can derive the essence of the interpretation. For example [Gen. 2:4], \"Such is the story of heaven and earth when they were created [b'hibar'am],\" and the Sages expounded \"b'Avraham\" from the lengthening of the expression, since there was no need to write \"b'hibar'am.\" And now I will explain the interpretations of the early scholars on this verse, to make clear to people why I did not see fit to interpret as they did.",
                "   Some interpret, \"In the beginning [barishonah] God created the heavens and the earth.\" One cannot say this, because the water came first, as it is written (v.2), \"a wind from God sweeping over the water.\" Furthermore, it is not written \"barishonah\" but rather \"b'reishit,\" in the construct state, as in (Gen. 10:10), \"The beginning of [reishit] his kingdom was Babel.\"",
                "   And the one who interprets it like (Hosea 1:2), \"When Adonai began to speak to Hoshea,\" in other words, \"At the beginning of God's creating of the heavens,\" in other words, when God had not yet created heavens and earth, \"the earth was unformed and void, with darkness over the surface of the deep and a wind from God sweeping over the water,\" the conclusion is that the water was created first. This is also nonsense, as it should not have written \"the earth was unformed and void,\" because, since it had not yet been created, it should not have called it \"earth\" before the formation of the waters, since the waters came first. ",
                "   But this is the essential straightforward meaning, according to the way of Scripture: that it is standard to anticipate and explain a matter which is unnecessary, for the sake of a matter tiat is mentioned below in another place. As it is written (Gen. 9:18), \"Shem, Ham, and Yafet,\" and it is written (ibid.), \"And Ham was the father of K'na'an.\" But this is because it is written below, \"Cursed be K'na'an,\" and, had it not been explained initially who K'na'an is, we would not know why Noah cursed him. [Similarly,] \"He [R'uven] lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard about it.\" And nothing is written here to the effect that Ya'akov said anything about R'uven. But since, at the time of his death, he said [about R'uven] (Gen. 49:4), \"Unstable as water, you shall excel no longer; For when you mounted your father’s bed, You brought disgrace—my couch he mounted,\" it says in advance, \"Israel heard about it,\" so that you will not be surprised when you see that he rebukes him for this at the end of his days. And similarly in many places.",
                " Also, this whole passage is about the work of the six days of Creation; Moshe our Master puts it in advance to explain to you what the Holy One, blessed be He, said at the time of the Giving of the Torah (Exod. 20:7-10), \"Remember the Shabbat and sanctify it, ... for in six days, Adonai made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day.\" And this is why it is written (Gen. 1:31), \"... and there was morning, the sixth day\" -- that sixth that was the end of the six days that the Holy One, blessed be He, mentioned at the time of the Giving of the Torah. That is why Moshe said this to Israel, to inform them that the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, is true.",
                "   And lest you imagine that this world had always been constructed as you see it now, full of all good things? It was not thus; rather, \"When God began to create, etc.,\" in other words, in the beginning of the creation of the heavens and the earth, in other words, at the time when the upper heavens and the earth had already been created, whether for a long time or for a short time, then (v.2) \"the earth was etc.\""
            ],
            [
                "\"Then the earth was\" – that [earth which] was built already ",
                "\"was void and empty\" – there was nothing in it, as it is written in Jeremiah, “I saw the earth and, behold, it was void and empty, and [I looked] to the heavens, and there was no light; I saw and there was no man, nor bird of the heavens, nor beast wandering, going forth” – this is <i>tohu vavohu</i>, destruction, without dwellers.",
                " “and darkness upon the waters” – this is (Jeremiah) “and toward the heavens and there was no light”",
                "“and wind/spirit…blowing upon the waters” – the wind was necessary for what is written further on, “and G-d said, ‘let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one spot”, for it was by the wind that the waters were gathered” - just as the Red Sea was split so that the dry land was visible, by means of “and G-d led the sea with a powerful East wind all that day, turning the sea into dry land, and the waters were split”."

And similarly, “And she saw him, that he was good” – she looked at Moshe born at six months, like Samuel – at the turn of the year – and she saw that he was good and beautiful – his indications (<i> simanav</i>, fingernails and hair were grown – so she hid him three months, that is, until the end of nine months, for behold, she saw him and knew that he was good and beautiful regarding his indications, he was not miscarried.",
                "“And G-d separated between the light and the dark” – such that 12 hours did the day last, and then 12 hours night. Light first, and afterwards, darkness. For, behold, the beginning of the creation of the worlds was with the statement, “Let there be light”. And any darkness that preceded that, as it is written, “and darkness on the face of the deep” – this was not night."
            ],
            [
                "“And G-d called the light day” – ask yourself: according to the straightforward meaning, why did G-d need to call the light \"day\" at the moment of its creation? Rather, this is what Moshe, our master, wrote: every place in the words of the Omnipresent where we see “day” and \"night\", such as “day and night shall not cease” (Genesis 8:22)– that is [referring to] the light and darkness created on the first day – Hashem calls them in all places “day” and “night”.  And likewise for every “And G-d called” written in this passage. And likewise, “And Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun: Yehoshua” (Numbers 13:15) [referring to] what was stated earlier “for the tribe of Ephraim – Hoshea bin Nun” (Numbers 13:8) – he’s the same one whom Moshe called “Yehoshua bin Nun”, whom he appointed previously as servant in his house. For, it is the manner of kings when appointing people over their house to give them new names, as it is stated, “And Par’oh called Yosef’s name <i>Tzafnat Pa’aneach</i>” (Genesis 45:45), [or] “and he called Daniel <i>Belshatzar</i> (Daniel 1:7).",
                "\"And the darkness He called night\" - Light is always first, and afterwards, darkness.",
                "“And it was evening, and it was morning” – It is not written here, “And it was night, and it was day”, but rather, “and it was evening, and it was morning” – the first day became evening and the sun set, and it became morning, the morning following the night, for the dawn broke” – behold, one day was completed from the six that Hashem spoke of in the Ten Commandments, and afterwards began the second day: “G-d said, ‘let there be a firmament’”. The text does not come to state that the evening and the morning are part of a single day, for it only needs to explain how there were six days – that the morning broke and the night was finished: behold, one days was completed and another day began."

            [
                "“And G-d said, ‘Let there be a firmament’” – after the first days was completed, the next morning, G-d said…",
                "“Firmament” (<i>rakia</i>) – in the passive voice, like <i>ashir</i> (“rich”), meaning “made rich”, or <i>chasid</i> (“pious”), meaning “made pious”. For, from the earth up until the supernal heavens there was water, as it is written, “(the spirit of G-d) hovering upon the face of the waters”, and now the Holy One (praised be He!) divided them at the middle and made a hammered-out plate extending from east to west and from north to south to make a distinction between the supernal waters. Now since he didn’t complete the work of the waters until the third day, when dry land appeared, it does not state “it was good” on the second day, but on the third day it is stated twice, “it was good” – once for the work of the waters and once for the emergence of the trees and grasses.",

                "“And it was evening, and it was morning, a second day” – the day inclined toward evening, after which was the morning after the second day, behold, the second of the six days spoken of by the Holy One (praised be He!) in the Ten Commandments, and now the third day began that morning.\n"

                "זה ינחמנו, if you were to question why our sages do not describe Lemech as a great prophet, as they described  Ever who had called his son Peleg, foreseeing that in his time mankind would be divided into 70 languages, etc., (Seder Olam 1) the reason is that Noach was the first man born after the death of Adam, and by calling him Noach he merely expressed the hope and prayer that Noach would be able to atone for the iniquity which Adam had perpetrated. The word נח is an allusion to הנחה, a relief, reduction in cost, i.e. the curse that mankind suffers under, especially the earth, should be lifted now that Adam had been replaced by an innocent human being who did not share time on earth with Adam who had brought a curse upon mankind. In the case of Peleg, it is impossible to see in that name the expression of a prayer, a plea; hence we must interpret it as a sign of his father’s prophetic vision."

                "ויהי כל ימי למך, why did the Torah bother to provide us with the number of years these wicked people lived on earth? This listing of historical data is also the custom of the prophets, one after another [when they listed the years wicked kings reigned over Israel or Yehudah. Ed.] Their purpose in doing so was to tell us how many years had elapsed since the creation of Adam, the first human being until the time when the events recorded by the prophets occurred. When we add up the numbers provided by the Torah both here, and in the chapters after the deluge, we have a continuous historical record of the history of mankind, and more especially, that of the Jewish people. The prophets spell out specifically the number of years that had elapsed between the Exodus from Egypt and the building of the Temple by Solomon, the high point of Jewish history. Daniel augments the record by providing information about how many years elapsed between the destruction of the first Temple and that of the second Temple."

                "וכנען ילד, Put (Cham’s third son) is not mentioned as having had any offspring. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 37,2 say that the offspring of Put was “swallowed,” (remained unidentified) until the time of the prophet Ezekiel who made mention of it in Ezekiel 30,5 where we read כוש ופוט ולוד  (compare also Ezekiel 27,10) Rabbi Yoseph Karo asked Rabbi Shemuel, seeing that the family of Put was not “swallowed” (i.e. that he was not sterile) why did the Torah not mention the fact that Put did beget offspring? The answer given to Rabbi Karo was that the Torah here wanted to list 70 “sons,” i.e. descendants of Noach. We learn from the number 70 that the nations that resulted from the confusion of the languages mentioned in the next paragraph (10,32) amounted to 70. Put, including all his sons are only considered as one of these 70 nations. If the Torah had written: “Put begat so and so,” how could the Torah have written afterwards in 10,32 ומאלה נפרדו הגוים בארץ וגו', “and from these the nations on earth emerged separately, etc.?” The impression that would have been created then would have been that all these nations are offspring of the sons of Noach and not of Noach himself, as the total then would have amounted to 71 and we would have had to deduct Noach in order to arrive at the correct count. In other words, Put’s offspring’s names not being listed means that it was lumped together with the father as founder of one of the nations.\n"

Why were these walls not destroyed by G’d? We must revise our opinion of why the people were punished, and accept that their principal sin was in not fulfilling G’d’s basic directive to be fruitful, to multiply, and to populate the whole earth, not just a small valley. Their declared objective had been not to scatter (verse 4) The fact that G’d forcefully scattered them afterwards shows that their sin must have been their failure to do so voluntarily."

Seeing that G'd had already told Avram that the process of inheriting the land of Canaan would not be complete until after 400 years from the time his true seed had been born, what was the point in telling him how many generations down the line this would occur? Until the 400 years would be up, G'd's promise would not be due for fulfillment in any event! The reason G'd mentioned the \"fourth generation\" was to explain to Avram why the delay in fulfilling His promise would require 400 ears. A generation in those days was considered a period of 100 years, as we know from Ediyot 12,9 so that 400 years equal 4 generations. We know from the second of the Ten Commandments, (Exodus 20,5 that G'd frequently extends His patience to sinners and their offspring until the fourth generation, waiting if finally someone will redeem the errant parents and grandparents by returning to the true lifestyle approved by G'd. This is why G'd described the sin of the Emorites at this time as לא שלם, \"not complete,\" in the sense of not yet irreversible, עד הנה until such time."

He had given 1000 pieces of silver to her brother, seeing that he had assumed that Avraham was no more than her brother to her as he had been led to believe. She herself had said so. This is not to be confused with the livestock which Avimelech gave Avraham at the conclusion of this story, the gifts mentioned in verse 14. The 1000 pieces of silver he had given before Sarah was taken to his palace. Even Pharaoh who had been punished more severely had made generous gifts not only to Avraham but even Lot had been enriched. (12,15). All this had been before any marriage ceremony.

Likewise (Esth. 3:1): \"Ahar these matters\" -- that Mordechai informed about Bigtan and Teresh -- \"King Ahashveirosh elevated Haman\" who wanted to kill Mordechai, but the fact that he [Mordechai] had saved the king availed Mordechai and Haman was impaled. So here: \"Ahar the matters\" -- that Avraham had made a covenant with Avimelech, him and Avraham's grandson and great-grandson (Gen. 21:23) [actually, with him and his (Avimelech's) grandson and great-grandson], and he [Avraham] gave him seven ewes, and the Holy One, blessed be He, had become angry because of this, because the Philistines' land had been given to Avraham, and also, in connection with Yehoshua, lots were cast for the five districts of the Philistines (Josh. 13:3, 14:2) as part of the lots of Israel, and the Holy One, blessed be He, had commanded regarding them (Deut. 20:16), \"do not let a soul remain alive,\" and therefore, ",

And afterward, I found the same idea in Midrash Sh'mu'el: : \"The Ark of the LORD remained in the territory of the Philistines seven months.\" (I Sam. 6:1). It is written (Gen. 21:30), \"You are to accept these seven ewes from me.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"You gave him seven ewes! By your life, his descendants will wage seven wars against your descendants and will defeat them.\" Another matter: \"By your life, his descendants will kill these seven righteous ones among your descendants: Shimshon, Hofni, Pinhas, Shaul, and his three sons.\" Another matter: \"By your life, his descendants will destroy these seven dwellings: the tent of meeting, Gilgal, Nov, Shiloh, Giv'on, and the Temple, twice.

The prefix מ in the word מרעהו is similar to the same prefix in the מריע ותוקע (Rosh Hashanah 33) [an unusual shift from the simple active mode kal, to the causative mode hiphil for basically the same activity, namely blowing the shofar. Ed.] as well as the מ in Jeremiah 21,4 אנכי מסב את כלי המלחמה, “The author quotes several more examples, as for instance, Proverbs 12,26 יתר מרעהו צדיק, ודרך רשעים תתעם, “the righteous enjoys advantages over his fellow man; the way of the wicked leads him astray.” [If I understand correctly, the letter מ is used transitively, although in this instance in the construction of a noun. Avimelech’s entourage רעהו was meant to give moral support to Avimelech in this ordinarily humiliating undertaking for him. Rash’bam goes as far as understanding the word ויתורו in Numbers 13,2 not as commonly understood as a verbal form of תור, “to tour, to traverse,” but as related to the word יתר from יתרון quoted in his citation from Proverbs 12,26. As to the fact that, if so, he word in Numbers should have been ויתירו instead of ויתורו, he quotes the interchangeable usage or ישוב and ישיב as well as יקום and יקים as examples where the hiphil is also used with the letter ו instead of the letter י for the middle root letter, עיו הפועל.

In Proverbs 14,10 we encounter a similar construction (though it is written with the vowel kametz under the letter מ) The verse reads: אבל לב יודעת מרת נפשו, “a heart knows its soul’s bitterness.” The use of the chataf kametz  under the letter מ there converts the word from adjective to being a noun. It is derived from מררות, “something bitter.” (compare Deuteronomy 32,32) In our verse here the word מורת is not a noun but a construct form of a verb, similar to Lamentations 1,20 כי מרה מריתי, “for I am experiencing a great deal of distress.” Here (in our verse) the vowel cholem instead of kametz as in Lamentations, is a manifestation of the abbreviated, chataf vowel often found with the middle letter of the root"

When the question of wages came up, Lavan exclaimed הכי אחי אתה ועבדתני חינם, “would there be any justice in your working for me without wages merely because you are my brother (and one does not have to pay one’s family)?” (29,15) Lavan implied: “on the contrary, you should be paid more generously because you are my family.” We have learned in Baba Batra 139 that when someone dies leaving behind many children (sons) and the estate is substantial, the sons share the inheritance whereas the daughters receive a stipend from the estate pending their getting married. When the estate the father left behind is meager, the daughters get the stipend whereas the sons will have to fend for themselves even if it involves begging. Admon says וכי בשביל שאני זכר ויפה כח בנכסים מרובים הורע כוחי בנכסים מועטין? “Am I supposed to suffer because I am male, able-bodied and my parents were wealthy?” [his argument was accepted by Rabban Gamliel, as was every other argument quoted in the name of Admon in the Talmud.

We find the following in Joshua 13,7-8 after G’d had instructed him at the beginning of the chapter to proceed with distributing the land of Israel to the various tribes, ועתה חלק את הארץ הזאת בנחלה לתשעת השבטים וחצי שבט המנשה. עמו הראובני והגדי לקחו נחלתם אשר נתן להם משה בעבר הירדן מזרחה נתן להם משה עבד ה' “Therefore, divide this territory into hereditary portions for the nine tribes and the half tribe of Menashe. Now, the Reubenites and the Gadites, along with the other half tribe of Menashe had already received their shares which Moses assigned to them on the east side of the Jordan- as assigned to them by Moses the servant of the Lord.” There can be no question that something is missing here as part of the second verse. You would have to say that this verse answered the question implied by the first verse, i.e. “what about the other half of the tribe of Menashe?” The reason for this peculiar division in describing the tribal allocation for the tribe of Menashe is that one half of the tribe, i.e. the half mentioned last, received their allocation by the authority of Moses himself, whereas the second half of the tribe received its allocation by the authority of Joshua. I, Samuel, (our author) have found a third verse [in addition to the two mentioned in the Midrash quoted. Ed.]  about the genealogy in Chronicles I 8,35-36 where we deal with the family of Yonathan son of King Sha-ul the following: ובני מיכה פיתון ומלך ןתארע ואחז. ואחז הוליד את יהועדה, ויהועדה הוליד את עלמת וגו'.. “The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Taarea, and Achaz. Achaz begot Yehoadah; and Yehoadah begot Alemeth, etc.” This same paragraph is repeated once more in chapter 9,41-43. In that sequence mention of Achaz is missing in the first of the two verses so that he appears out of nowhere in the second verse. Not only that but he is introduced with the connective letter ו, i.e. “and Achaz, etc. We must therefore conclude that the word ואחז הוליד, “and Achaz begot,” answers the verse which had in effect been interrupted in 8,35 with the word אחז. The author takes up the thread interrupted in chapter 8 and fills the reader in about the offspring of Achaz.\n"

                "ואיה וענה, I believe that the real names of these people were “Veayah” and “Veanah,” not “Ayah” and “Anah.” The same is true of Numbers 13,14 where the letter ו is part of the name itself, i.e. ופסי, just as it is in Esther where the letter ו is part of the name of Queen Vashti, i.e. ושתי. Even though these sons of Tzivon are also referred to by the names Ayah and Adah in Chronicles I 1,40, we need not attribute too much meaning to this, as there are numerous instances when such names are not accurately reported.  (Examples of such inaccuracies are Genesis 10,23 where the letters ו in the words וחול וגתר (names) clearly are not part of the names themselves. The same is true of Chronicles I 1,17 where all four of these names are introduced with the letter ו. Clearly, the two versions cannot both be correct. Anyone who interprets the letter ו in the words (names) ואיה וענה to be connective letters ו, must surely answer the question of what prompted the Torah to write such connective letters ו here when it did not seem to be called for. Why would just these sons have been selected by the Torah to be linked to one another by the connective letter ו and not numerous other sons who appear in this chapter? [the author challenges his grandfather Rashi’s interpretation. Ed.] The proofs cited by such commentators for their interpretation are not convincing at all. The very letters ו whom these commentators quote as support for their thesis are themselves not connective letters For instance, in Samuel II 13,20 the line ותשב תמר ושוממה בית אבשלום אחיה, the word ושוממה means the same as שבי, as in שבי אלמנה בית אביך, (Genesis 38,11) where Yehudah tells his daughter-in-law (also) called Tamar to await Shelah’s growing up by remaining like a grieving widow in her father’s house. The word ותשב in Samuel II 13.20 has two meanings. It tells us that Tamar henceforth was isolated, lonely, an outcast. The word בודדה for “lonely,” is implied but not spelled out, and the whole line must be understood as if the prophet had written ותשב תמר בודדה ושוממה, “Tamar lived lonely and abandoned in the house of her brother Avshalom.” Psalms 76,7 מגערתך אלוקי יעקב נרדם ורכב וסוס, must be understood as מגערת אלוקי יעקב נרדם חיל שונאינו, at Your blast, O G’d of Yaakov, horse and chariot (with our enemies) lay stunned.” The reference is to the army mentioned in the preceding verses. The word אנשי חיל, “the soldiers,” which appears in verse 6 of that chapter is presumed as also applying to verse 7. If this were not so, the verse would make little sense. We find that a similar verse to that in Psalms 77,7 is found in Exodus 15,1, where the Torah includes the riders of the cavalry as having been tossed into the sea, as their survival would hardly have constituted an overwhelming victory by G’d.",

                "(1) THIS, THEN, IS THE LINE OF YA'AKOV. Intelligent people should discern and understand what our Rabbis taught us, that Scripture never forsakes its plain sense. Even though, essentially, Torah comes to teach us and inform us through hints from the plain sense, narratives, laws, and rules, and through elaborations of the text and the 32 principles of R' Eliezer the son of R' Yosi HaG'lili, and through the 13 principles of R' Yishma'el. And the early Sages, because of their piety, engaged in inclining after the drashot, which are primary, and because of this, they were not familiar with the deep plain sense of Scripture. As the Sages said, \"Do not make your children engage much in Scripture\" [see Ber. 28a and Rashi there]. And they also said (B.M. 33a), \"One who occupies himself with Scripture [alone] is meritorious but not very much so, ... but one who engages in Talmud, there is no greater measure than this.\" And in this way, they were not so familiar with the plain sense of Scriptural passages. And as it says in Mas. Shabbat, \"I was 18 years old and had read the entire Talmud, and I did not know that Scripture never forsakes its plain sense.\" And our Master Shlomo, my maternal grandfather, the enlightener of the Exile, who expounded on Torah, N'vi'im, and K'tuvim, set his mind also on explaining the plain sense of Scripture. However, I, Sh'mu'el the son of R' Meir, his son-in-law, may his sainted name be for a blessing, argued with him and before him, and he acknowledged to me that if he had had more time, he would need to produce other commentaries according to the plain meanings that renew each day. ",
                "And now the intelligent people will see what the early ones explained (2) \"THIS IS THE LINE OF YA'AKOV\" as \"These are the events and the occurrences that happened to Ya'akov.\" And this is nonsense. For every \"eleh tol'dot\" in Torah and K'tuvim is either about the individual's children or, more often, his grandchildren, as I explained in [Parashat] \"Eleh Tol'dot Noah\" (Gen. 6:9). Above that, in Parashat B'reishit, it's written (Fen. 5:32), \"Noah was 500 years old, and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Yafet.\" And after that, it explains that the world sinned, but (Gen. 6:8) \"Noah found favor.\" And after that, it states (Gen. 6:9), \"These are the generations of Noah,\" his children's children -- how he had three sons, and the Holy One, blessed be He, ordered him to bring them into the Ark for 12 months, and upon their exit, \"sons were born to them after the Flood\" (Gen. 10:1), until they increased to 70 descendants, who were the 70 nations, as it is written (Gen. 10:32), \"from these branched out etc.\"And likewise with Esav. The first section (Gen. 36:1-5) specifies Esav's sons who were born to him in his father's location, and after that \"he went to another land\" (v.6) and settled on Mt. Seir (v.9) and all that section. And it is written (v.9), \"This, then, is the line of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites, in the hill country of Seir.\" And all of this second section is about Esav's children [their descendants].    And as we found with Esav -- that it states that his sons were born in his father's neighborhood, before he \"went to another land because of his brother Jacob\" (Gen. 36:6), and his grandchildren were born at Mt. Seir -- so with Ya'akov: above, it says (Gen. 35:22), \"Now the sons of Jacob were twelve in number. Etc.\" And it states at the end (vv. 26-27), \"These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram. And [Jacob] came to his father Isaac, etc.\" Thus it has set out Ya'akov's sons and where they were born, as it id with Esav's sons. And now [in our chapter] it writes (Gen. 37:2), \"This is the line of Ya'akov\": his grandchildren, who were 70, how they were born. How? \"Yosef was 17 years old\"; his brothers envied him; and as a result, \"Yehuda left his brothers\" (Gen. 38:1) and had sons in K'ziv and in Adulam -- Shelah, Peretz, and Zerah; and it ensues that Yosef \"was taken down to Egypt\" (Gen. 39:1), and Menashe and Ephraim were born to him in Egypt, and Yosef sent for his father and his household, until they numbered 70. And Moshe our Master had to write all this, since he rebuked them in connection with this, \"Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy persons in all\" (Deut. 10:22; see 11:1).",
                "(3) בן שבע עשרה שנה, this was necessary so that we realise that the separation of Joseph from his father –during which time Yaakov had considered his as dead- lasted for 22 years.

We know that Shechem was very close to Shiloh from Joshua 24,1 and the whole paragraph following. The description in what is reported in that paragraph sounds as if could all have taken place at Shiloh. [seeing that Joshua refers to the people listening to him “in the presence of the Lord”, i.e. at the Sanctuary which stood in Shiloh. Compare Joshua chapter 18,1 for similar wording referring directly to a presence of the people in Shiloh, in the presence of the Lord, i.e. the Tabernacle which had been erected there.” Ed.] Furthermore, in verse 26 of chapter 24 Joshua also concludes by stating that all of the exhortations in the chapter demanding from the people to remain loyal to G’d and His Torah had been addressed to them at the מקדש ה', G’d’s Sanctuary. All this supports the view that the precise location was Shiloh, whereas the region in which Shiloh was situated was Shechem, hence the reason both locations were mentioned. These two locations are linked in one sentence also in Judges 21,19 as well as in Jeremiah 41,5. There was open space at Shechem around the famous oak located near Shechem. At that location a mass rally could be held easily. The people would pay homage to the Sanctuary in Shiloh from that vantage point, as it was in their line of vision. This exegesis refutes the view of the heretics, especially that of the Christians, who claim that the שילה spelled here with a ה at the end and the city known as Shiloh spelled in Scripture as שלו as in Samuel 1,24 (where Elkanah would make his pilgrimages and where the Sanctuary stood) are not the same, the one in our verse referring to the Saviour, while the one in Samuel being a reference to the town. Yaakov, as opposed to the view of the Christians, did not elevate the position of Yehudah to that of being a Saviour beginning with that point in “time,” but he predicted that after the death of Solomon, the high point in Jewish history, a decline would set in as documented by the 10 tribes withdrawing their support of a king from the tribe of Yehudah.\n"
