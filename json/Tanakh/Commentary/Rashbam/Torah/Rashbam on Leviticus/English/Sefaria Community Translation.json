                "HE CALLED TO MOSHE.  As it wrote above at the end of the book [Exodus], Moshe could not enter the Tent of Meeting, etc.  Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, called him from within the Tent of Meeting.  So this is Scripture means:  \"He called to Moshe from the Tent of Meeting, and He spoke to him, saying.\"  \"From the Tent\" refers back to \"He called,\" as in (Ex. 19:3), \"And Adonai called to him from the mountain, saying.\"  And he heard the voice speaking from the Tent of Meeting (see Num. 7:89) -- from the Tent of Meeting he heard the voice.  \"God called to him from out of the bush, saying\" (Ex. 3:4).  The duplicative expression \"He spoke\" (Lev. 1:1), as I explained in Parashat Noah, is, just as it says (Num. 8:2), \"Speak to Aharon and say,\" so it says \"He spoke to Moshe, saying\" (Lev. 1:1) -- [saying] to Moshe."

All the sections about plagues on the person, plagues on garments, and plagues on houses, their appearances, the calculations of quarantine periods, white hairs and black and yellow hairs, we have nothing following the straightforward meaning of scripture and nothing from expertise in the natural ways of humans; rather, the midrash of the Sages adn their laws and their traditions from the early Sages -- that is the essential truth.
