                "But there -The phrase 'but there' refers back to  \"... a tent that shall not fall, whose pegs shall never be moved, and all of whose ropes shall not be torn.\" (Isaiah 33:20) Evil will not be, but rather good. The Lord will there, great for us, and the city will be a place of rivers and stream as it says \"And he measured one thousand, a stream that I could not cross...\" (Ezekiel 47:5) So too Yoel prophesied \"...and a spring shall emanate from the house of the Lord...\" (Yoel 4:18) This is the river which will progressively increase."

                "\"Upon your walls, oh Jerusalem\" Our rabbis explained this according to its implied meaning - angels who recall her destruction before Gd in order that He rebuild her. What did they say? \"You will rise, You will have mercy on Zion...\" (Tehillim 102:14) \"For the Lord has chosen Zion...\" (Tehillim 132:13) as it says in tractate Menachot. Yonatan translates 'your walls' as the forefathers who guard us like a wall."
