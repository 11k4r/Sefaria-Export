Moshe rebuked B'nei Yisrael close to his death while he was already revered in their eyes, with the many miracles that he did for them: took them out of Egypt, split the sea for them, brought down the Manna, brought them the slav (some say this is a quail), gave them the Torah, and brought up the well. And here, I am going to rebuke them at the beginning of my mission?!"
