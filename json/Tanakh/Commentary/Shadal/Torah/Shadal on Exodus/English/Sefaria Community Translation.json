                "The Hebrew midwives - the understanding of our sages, o blessed memory, and Onkelos, and Rashbam, and Ramban and Ra\"z is that those midwives were from the seed of Israel, and the understanding of the Alexandrian translator, and[Eusebius Sophronius] Hieronymos, and Yoseohus Flavius, and Don Itzchak [Abrabanel] is that they were Egyptian, these midvives of the Hebrews. And this is right, since how does it make any sense that [Pharaoh] would order Jewish women to destroy all the children of their own people and believe that they won't reveal such a thing? And [Philiphus] Klericus affirms that if they were not Jewish the text should have read \"midwives to the Hebrews\". And the Ra\"z comes and says that it should read \"the midwives that served the Hebrews\" - and this has no standing, since the text could have said \"the midwives that served the Hebrews\" by omitting the word 'et' as it does in (Jer. 31:29) \"every man that eats  sour grapes\". And what is proved by the phrase 'the midwives feared God' is no proof at all, since it is not written here Hashem, rather, E-lohim, and everyone who has a god (a God of truth or a god of falsehood) would fear killing babies that did not sin at all, whatever people they are from. And an example of this is what is said regarding Amalek 'and he attacked you in the rear, and you were tired and exhausted, and he did not fear E-lohim' (Deu. 25:18) and my dear student, R. Yaakov Chay Pardo, may the tzadik's memory bring blessings to us, adds that if they were from another people it made more sense to say they did this out of fear and not of love, since if they were Jewish what need would there be to remind us that they feared God, since all humans love the children of their own people. Also, what they point out that the names Shifra and Puah are not Egyptian, but come from Hebrew roots, this is not relevant, since they would come from the Land of Goshen, that is closer to the land of Israel (see Gen. 46:34), and it is possible that they just spoke a language closer to Hebrew like Cannanite, and so their names would be closer to Hebrew and Cannanite. And another thing that is clear is that for a people that is \"many and strong\"  makes no sense to have only those two midwives, and so Rabbi Ibn Ezra and (and after him the Ra'z) says that those two were the supervisors of the all the midwives; and Rabbi Ovadia Sforno says that Pharaoh talked first to the midwives of his city, and after them not doing his bidding,  he did not trust others from other places; and more, this is happening far away from his eyes, since Israel is living in the Land of Goshen and not in Egypt. How else could we explain that the land is full of them, but that \"in the land of Goshen, where Israel lived, there was no hail\"? And I say that Pharaoh did not want to talk to all the midwives at once, since if all of them would kill all the Israelite babies at one moment, the thing would be known and publicized.And if just two of them were going around killing them - and not all the other midwives, others could say it  was an accident, and he thought to order all the midwives in small groups, so that the matter would not be known [if it had worked with those first two]."

                "\"In the heart of the fire\": libah instead of lehava, and thus in the Mishna [Bava Qama 6:4]. From the bush [sneh]: from the thorn bushes that were on that mountain, and thence it was called Sinai (cf. ibn Ezra). Now the bush was on fire, but it was not really burning, but was surrounded by flames like a burning object, since the fire was flashing between the thorns, but did not take to them, and thus at first Moses saw the fire amid the bush, and the bush flashing with fire, and then he saw that it was not burnt, and he said: 'Let me turn aside to see' why this bush is not burning. The root b.'.r. in Qal is an active verb, and its meaning is the flames of fire and also the burning of the object which is on fire, since it is customary in the world that there is no separation between the flames and the burning, but here the bush was on fire, but was not burnt.",

                "We are forced to say that Scripture left out some of the generations between Kehat and Amram, for in [Numbers 3:28] the count for Kehat of all the males from a month and up was 8,600, and he only had four sons as his family, so each of those four sons would [have had to] have 2,150 sons. And behold Amram only had Aaron, Moses, and Miriam. Moses only had two sons, and Aaron four, so how is is possible for Amram, Yitzhar, Chevron, and Uziel to have 2,150 souls [each] in the second year after leaving the land of Egypt? Therefore, one must conclude as IB Koppe in his essay, \"Israelitas non 215, sed 430 annos in Eagypt commoratos esse,\" Gottinga 1777, where he said (and Rossenmueller agreed with him) that Levi, Kehat, and Amram were not in sequential generations, but rather other generations were between them. And according to this, one can answer as its plain meaning the number of 430 years that Israel was in Egypt [Exodus 12:40]. And according to this, the powerful procreation of the Israelites in Egypt can be understood, which the Torah did not speak of as an actual miracle. And the wise Jost (Volume 1 page 2) said that the names mentioned here are family names, so it is saying that so long as the father was still alive, the children stayed bonded together as one family for the most part (even though sometimes sons would divide their fathers household, as was the case for Isaac and Ishmael in the lifetime of Abraham, and Jacob and Esau in the lifetime of Isaac), and with the death of the father the family would split, and sometimes even after the death of the father they would not split off until some time. So the plain meaning of this section according to his opinion is that the family of Levi remained one family unit, and was called \"Levi\" for the span of 137 years after the death of Jacob, and then, after Levi died, the family split into three, the names of which being Gershom, Kehat, and Merari. So, the family of Kehat stayed as one unit for 133 years, and afterward it was split into four families. And at the time of the exodus from Egypt, 137 years had already passed, and the Amram family was one family, of which came Moses and Aaron. So if you add together the three numbers of 137, 133, and 137, and add 17 years on that for how long the Israelites were in Egypt before Jacobs death, you have 424 years, meaning close to 430 years. Therefore (he says) whenever it says \"the son of Yitzhar\", \"the son of Kehat\", etc, it means \"the descendant of Yitzhar\", \"the descendant of Kehat\"."
