                "Chazoel asked:\"Why is my master crying?\" This means to say:\"Why do you care about the death of the king that you cry over him?\" The prophet replied that he was not crying about this rather [he was crying] because he saw in his vision the evil that Chazoel himself would do to the Jews, that he would set fire to their fortifications and kill by the sword their young men and their infants he would dash to the rock[s] or on the ground to trample them with their feet and their pregnant ones he would split with great brazenness. And when Chazoel asked:\"What is your servant the dog that he will do such a big thing?\" Elisho informed him that he will reign over Aram"
