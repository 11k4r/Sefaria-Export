                "Jonah went and fled toward Tarshish from before God: How could he flee?...The prophet was full of wisdom and intelligence; how could he think that he could flee from God? Rather, he sought to flee from before God; that is, from being in God's presence, which is the spirit of prophecy. He thought that if he were to leave the Land of Israel, the spirit of prophecy would no longer rest upon him. And so he would be able to refuse to go on the mission, since he thought that gentiles are quick to repent, and if he went to them on this mission of God, they would repent from their evil ways. And this would condemn Israel, since Jonah and the other prophets keep going to them on missions from God and they do not repent from their evil way...."

In Pirkei de Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Tarfon said that the fish was appointed from the six days of creation to swallow Jonah."
