It was not to Israel alone that commandments were issued, but also to all peoples.  He distinguished Israel from the (other) nations by commanding them concerning additional precepts, sanctifying them through the purity of body and food.  However, traditional precepts were granted to the first Man and his progeny (i.e., the Seven Noachide Laws).  These are \"the statements of God.\""
