                    "(1) The reason for [the command], \"Make for yourself an ark of wood,\" is \"so that you can place the tablets in it when you descend.\" This ark was made entirely of wood – it and the cover that was over it, in the manner of all boxes. And the tablets were there until the Mishkan was made, at which time they made the ark covered in gold, and the covering above it, which was of pure gold.",
                    "(2) According to the plain meaning of the text, it is possible that [the words,] “Make for yourself an ark of wood,” hints at the ark that was [later] made by Betzalel. This is because Moshe was commanded concerning the Mishkan and its vessels from the start, and the first command was, “They shall make an ark of shittim wood” (Shemot 25:10), since this was the crux of the intention behind all of the Mishkan – that God would rest [as it were] between the keruvim. After this they made the golden calf, and when God was appeased by Moshe and told him that He would write upon these tablets like the first writing, He commanded him in brief that he should made for these tablets an ark of wood; this was commanded to him for the first tablets. Now He reminds him of the original command concerning the Mishkan, upon which everything [else] depends, and from this Moshe deduced that he should make the Mishkan and its vessels as he had originally been commanded. The meaning of the words, “And they were there as God had commanded me,” is that they were there forever, as God had originally commanded (ibid. 21-22): “And in the ark you shall place the testimony which I shall give to you, and I shall meet with you there, and speak with you….”"
