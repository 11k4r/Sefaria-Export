            "And Hashem spoke to Moshe, in the Sinai Desert, in the second year from the exodus of Egypt, in the first month saying thus:",
            "And the Children of Yisrael will do the Korban Pesach in its proper time,",
            "On the fourteenth day of this month, in the evening, you shall do it in the proper time, according to all its rules and statutes, you shall do it.",
            "And Moshe spoke to Bnei Yisrael, saying thus: You shall offer the Korban Pesach,",
            "And you shall offer the Korban Pesach on the fourteenth day of this month, in the evening, in the Desert of Sinai, according to all that Hashem has commanded you regarding it you shall do it.",
            "And there were men who were ritually impure from a dead body, and they were therefore not able to offer the Korban Pesach on the proper day, and they therefore came before Moshe and Aharon on that day.",
            "And these impure men said, 'We are ritually impure, from a dead body, but why should we be not allowed to bring the Korban Pesach before Hashem, in the proper time, with all the rest of Bnei Yisrael?'",
            "And Moshe said to them, 'Stand here and I will listen to what Hashem commands me regarding you!'",
            "And Hashem spoke to Moshe saying:",
            "Speak to Bnei Yisrael saying thusly: Any man who is ritually impure or on a distant journey, whether now or in a future generation, he will offer a Korban Pesach to Hashem, ",
            "But he will do so in the second month, on the fourteenth day, in the evening, he shall do so, and he shall eat the Korban Pesach along with Matzos and Maror. (Unleavened bread and a bitter herb.)",
            "None should remain from it till morning, and one should not break a bone of the paschal lamb, and you will fulfill the commandment according to all its statutes.",
            "However, a man who is pure and not on a far journey, and he yet fails to offer the Pesach offering, his soul will be cut off from that of his people, because he did not bring the Korban of Hashem at the proper time, and he shall bear the guilt for his sin.",
            "And if there is a stranger living amongst you, and he offers a Korban to Hashem, he must do it according to all the statutes regarding the sacrifice; there shall be one law for all, whether a citizen of the nation of Yisrael, or a stranger amongst the Jews.",
            "And on the day that they erected the Mishkan, the Cloud of Glory covered the Mishkan, and the Tent of the Testimony, and in the evening the Cloud remained over the Mishkan as a pillar of fire, until the morning.",
            "So it was; a cloud in the day, and a pillar of fire in the night.",
            "And when the cloud lifted from the Tent, then would the Children of Yisrael set forth and begin to travel. And in the place where the cloud ceased, there would Bnei YIsrael make camp.",
            "On the word of Hashem they traveled and on the word of Hashem they camped; when the Cloud of Glory covered the Mishkan, they camped.",
            "Yet when the cloud stretched out over the Mishkan for many days, Bnei Yisrael would listen to Hashem and observe his statutes, and not travel.",
            "No matter how long the Cloud stayed above the Mishkan, on the word of Hashem they traveled and on the word of Hashem they made camp.",
            "And there were times when the Cloud was there merely from the evening to the morning, and then it arose, and then the Jews would break camp, or two days and a night and then the Cloud went up, so too then they would travel.",
            "Whether two day, or a month, or years, when the Cloud stayed above the Sanctuary Bnei Yisrael camped and did not leave that spot.",
            "Upon the word of Hashem they camped and on the word of Hashem they broke camp, the word of Hashem they guarded; the word of Hashem through the mouth of Moshe."
