            "The precepts were given to Israel for no reason other than for Israel to stay alive, for it is said of the precept, \"Which if a man do, he shall live by them\" (Lev. 18:5) - live by them and not die by them.  Therefore, when there is danger to life, no precept is to be insisted on except those prohibiting idolatry, unchastity, and murder.  When does the rule apply?  Not in a time of religious persecution.  But during a time of religious persecution, a man must be willing to give up his life even for the least demanding of precepts, as it is said, \"You shall not profane My Holy Name - I am to be hallowed among the children of Israel\" (Lev. 22:32)."
