            "A person shouldn’t dig a pit close to the pit of his fellow, unless he distances the pit three Tefachim (handbreadths) from the wall of his friend and applies lime to the walls of the pit. Rabbi Yehudah says, with soil that comes away when held, one person can dig his pit on one side while the other digs on the other side as long as they both distance three Tefachim from the border and apply lime to the walls of their pits. A person must distance the launderer’s pool"
