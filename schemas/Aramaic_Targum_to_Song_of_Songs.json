    "enDesc": "Targum to the Song of Songs (Translation of the Song of Songs‎) belongs to the Aramaic translations of the bible which were used for instruction and explanation in schools and public worship. Song of Songs' language is mostly Western Aramaic from Israel with some traces of Eastern Aramaic. Its present version is traceable back to the 7th Century. It also contains some Arabic words suggesting that additions and changes were made during the Muslim period. There is a unitary topic running through it as the Targum recounts the entire history of Israel from the Exodus to the destruction of the Temple. Two layers of text are found; a simple translation of the Biblical text and an expansive homiletic midrash. This targum was so popular it was translated into Yiddish, Ladino, Latin, Judaeo-Arabic, Judaeo-Persian, Neo-Aramaic and several modern European languages.",
