    "enDesc": "Arba'ah Turim (Four Rows) often called simply the Tur, is an important Halakhic code, composed by Yaakov ben Asher. In the Arba'ah Turim, Rabbi Jacob traces the practical Jewish law from the Torah text and the dicta of the Talmud through the Rishonim. He used the code of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi as his starting point; these views are then compared to those of Maimonides, as well as to the Ashkenazi traditions contained in the Tosafist literature. Unlike Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, the Tur is not limited to normative positions, but compares the various opinions on any disputed point. In most instances of debate, Rabbi Jacob follows the opinion of his father, Rabbi Asher ben Yehiel, the Rosh. The four sections are as follows: Orah Hayim; laws of prayer and synagogue, Sabbath and holidays. Yoreh De'ah; shehita and kashrut and forbidden mixtures. Even Ha'ezer; laws of marriage and divorce. Hoshen Mishpat; laws of finance, financial responsibility, damages (personal and financial) and legal procedure.",
