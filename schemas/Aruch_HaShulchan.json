    "enDesc": "Arukh HaShulhan (The Table Is Set) is a chapter-by-chapter restatement of the Shulhan Arukh. Compiled and written by Rabbi Yehiel Michel Epstein, the work attempts to be a clear, organized summary of the sources for each chapter of the Shulhan Arukh and its commentaries, with special emphasis on the positions of the Jerusalem Talmud, Maimonides and the glosses of Rema. When he deems it necessary, he also mentions the views of earlier authorities. The work follows the structure of the Tur and the Shulhan Arukh: a division into four large parts, subdivided into parallel chapters (simanim) that match in all three works. These are further subdivided into paragraphs (seifim). Epstein also wrote a similar work entitled Arukh HaShulhan he-Atid (Laying the Table of the Future), a parallel work to Arukh HaShulhan summarising and analysing the laws that will apply in Messianic times. Indeed, some of these laws, such as those relating to agriculture and farming, apply today for those living in the Land of Israel.",
