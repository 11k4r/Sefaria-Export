    "enDesc": "Ekhah Rabbah (The Great Lamentations) is a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the Book of Lamentations. It belongs to oldest works of the Midrashic literature. It begins with 36 consecutive proems forming a separate collection, certainly made by the author. They constitute more than one-fourth of the work. These proems which are arranged in the sequence of the verses originated in the discourses. The haggadic explanations of this book were treated as appropriate dirges on the destruction of the first and second Temples in Jerusalem on the Ninth of Av. Numerous Greek words suggest the book was composed in Israel, sometime after the Jerusalem Talmud was completed, in the 5th century.",
