    "enDesc": "Esther Rabbah (The Great Esther) is the midrash to the Book of Esther. Except in the Vilna and Warsaw editions with their modern and arbitrary divisions, this Midrash consists of six \"parashiyyot\" (chapters, sections; singular = \"parashah\") introduced by one or more proems. From its plan and scope it is apparently an incomplete collection derived from the rich haggadic material on Esther. The book draws from earlier Midrashim and was expanded over the centuries. It was probably written around the 10th Century though others date it to the 12th or 13th century.",
