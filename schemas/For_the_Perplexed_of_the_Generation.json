    "enDesc": "For the Perplexed of the Generation, was written by Avraham Yitzchak HaCohen Kook (1865 - 1935) before he moved from Latvia to Eretz Israel in1904. It was published posthumously. The volume presents HaRav Kook’s response to the issues of his time, including Zionism, critical scholarship and secular nationalism. For the Perplexed of the Generation was mentioned in 1937 in a list of unpublished works by HaRav Kook. At that time, Rav Kook’s son, Zvi Yehudah Kook (1891-1982), denied its existence. It wasn’t actually seen until an electronic version appeared in 2010.",
