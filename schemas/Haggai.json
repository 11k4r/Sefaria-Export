    "enDesc": "The Book of Haggai is the tenth of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. It is a short book consisting of two chapters. It is set at the start of the Persian Empire with Zerubbabel leading the Jews after their return to the land of Israel. Haggai’s message is filled with an urgency to rebuild the Second Temple and attributes a recent drought to the people's refusal to do so, which he views as key to Jerusalem’s glory. The book ends with the prediction of the downfall of kingdoms, with one Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, as the Lord’s chosen leader.",
