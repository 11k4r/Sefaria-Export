    "enDesc": "Tikune ha-Zohar (Repairs of the Zohar), also known as the Tikunim is a main text of Kabbalah. It is a separate appendix to the Zohar consisting of seventy commentaries on the opening word of Bereshit, in a style of Kabbalistic Midrash. Containing deep secret teachings of Torah, stirring dialogues and fervent prayers, the explicit and apparent theme and intention of Tikune ha-Zohar is to repair and support the Shekhinah or Malkhut and to bring on the Redemption and conclude the Exile. It is almost entirely written in Aramaic, except for quotations from Tanakh. The Aramaic of Tikunei ha-Zohar differs somewhat from the Aramaic of the Talmud and from the Aramaic of the rest of the Zohar. Though claimed to be ancient it is a medieval work. There is a Jewish custom to study it especially in the month of Elul and also during the Ten Days of Repentance.",
