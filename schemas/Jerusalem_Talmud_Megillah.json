    "enDesc": "The Jerusalem Talmud (\"instruction, learning\") (4th-5th CE) is a collection of rabbinic notes on the Mishnah (2nd CE). It is also known as the Palestinian Talmud or Talmuda de-Eretz Yisrael (Talmud of the Land of Israel). These latter names are considered more accurate by some as the work was probably composed in the Galilee area rather than Jerusalem. The language used is a Western Aramaic dialect. It is often fragmentary and difficult to read because of its rushed redaction due to persecution. Its arrangement has two structures; either numbering each folios starting from 2a or numbering each chapter and halakha (Mishnah).  Megillah (Scroll) belongs to the second order, Moed (Festivals) and discusses regulations and prescriptions regarding the reading of the scroll of Esther at Purim, and the reading of other passages from the Torah and Neviim in the synagogue. It has four chapters.",
