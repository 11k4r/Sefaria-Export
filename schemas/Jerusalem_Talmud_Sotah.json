    "enDesc": "The Jerusalem Talmud (\"instruction, learning\") (4th-5th CE) is a collection of rabbinic notes on the Mishnah (2nd CE). It is also known as the Palestinian Talmud or Talmuda de-Eretz Yisrael (Talmud of the Land of Israel). These latter names are considered more accurate by some as the work was probably composed in the Galilee area rather than Jerusalem. The language used is a Western Aramaic dialect. It is often fragmentary and difficult to read because of its rushed redaction due to persecution. Its arrangement has two structures; either numbering each folios starting from 2a or numbering each chapter and halakha (Mishnah). Sotah (Wayward Wife) belongs to the third order, Nashim (Women) and discusses the ritual of the Sotah – the woman suspected of adultery (Num 5) as well as other rituals involving a spoken formula (such as breaking the heifer's neck, the King's septa-annual public Torah reading, the Blessings and Curses of Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, etc...). It has nine chapters.",
