    "enDesc": "The Book of Joel is the second of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. After a superscription ascribing the prophecy to Joel son of Pethuel, the book may be broken down into four sections. Lament over a great locust plague and a severe drought and the effects of these events on agriculture and farmers. A more apocalyptic passage compares the locusts to an army and reveals that they are God’s army. It closes with a call for national repentance in the face of God's judgment and a promise of future blessings.",
