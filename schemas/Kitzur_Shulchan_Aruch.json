    "enDesc": "The Kizur Shulhan Arukh is a summary of the Shulhan Arukh of Joseph Karo with reference to later commentaries, The Kizur states what is permitted and what is forbidden without ambiguity. Ganzfried emphasised the customs of Jews of Hungary at that time. This work was explicitly written as a popular text and its wide circulation has seen it become a standard reference work in halakhah; functioning as an abridgement of the Shulhan Arukh much like its Sephardi counterpart the Ben Ish Hai. Ganzfried based his decisions on three Ashkenazi authorities: Rabbi Yaakov Lorberbaum; Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, author of Shulhan Arukh HaRav; and Rabbi Abraham Danzig, author of Hayyei Adam and Hochmat Adam. In cases of disagreement he adopted the majority view. However, the Mishnah Berurah has mostly supplanted his work, the Hayyei Adam and the Arukh HaShulhan as the primary authority on Jewish daily living among Ashkenazi Jews.",
