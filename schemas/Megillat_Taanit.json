    "enDesc": "Megillat Taanit (The Fast Scroll) is a chronicle which enumerates 35 eventful days on which the Jewish nation either performed glorious deeds or witnessed joyful events. These days were celebrated as feast-days. Public mourning was forbidden on 14 of them, and public fasting on all. The days are enumerated, not in the chronological order of the events they commemorate, but in the sequence of the calendar. In most of the editions this chronicle consists of two parts, which are distinct in language and in form. The text or Megillat Ta'anit proper, written in Aramaic and containing merely brief outlines in concise style and the Scholia or commentaries on the text, written in Hebrew no earlier than the 7th Century. Megillat Ta'anit is extant in many editions, and has had numerous commentaries. The best edition of the Aramaic and Hebrew text is that of Vered Noam.",
