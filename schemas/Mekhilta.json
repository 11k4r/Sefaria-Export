    "enDesc": "Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (Measure, Rule of R. Ishamel) is a halakhic midrash to the Book of Exodus, used to denote a compilation of Scriptural exegesis using Talmudic hermeneutics. Neither the Babylonian nor the Jerusalem Talmud mention the Mekhilta by name, but it is referred to once as She'ar Sifre debe Rab. The first person to mention the Mekhilta by name was the author of the Geonic work Halakhot Gedolot. Another Geonic name for it was Mekhilta de-Erez Yisrael. The author, or more correctly the redactor, of the Mekhilta cannot be ascertained. Some scholars thought it was R. Ishmael ben Elisha, R. Akiba's contemporary. The present Mekhilta cannot, however, be the one composed by R. Ishmael, as is proved by the references in it to R. Ishmael's pupils and to other later tannaim. Both Maimonides and the author of the Halakhot Gedolot, moreover, refer, evidently on the basis of a tradition, to a much larger Mekhilta extending to the end of the Torah, while the midrash here considered discusses only certain passages of Exodus. It must be assumed, therefore, that R. Ishmael composed an explanatory midrash to the last four books of the Torah, and that his pupils amplified it.",
