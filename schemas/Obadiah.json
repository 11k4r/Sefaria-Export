    "enDesc": "The Book of Obadiah is the fourht of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses, making it the shortest book of the Tanakh (Bible). The book is a vision concerning the fall of Edom. Obadiah describes an encounter with God who addresses Edom’s arrogance and charges them for their violent actions against their brother nation, the House of Jacob. When Nebuchadnezzar II sacked Jerusalem and carted away the King of Judea, Edom assisted the Babylonians in looting the city. Obadiah suggests Edom should have remembered that blood was thicker than water. He said in judgement God would wipe out the house of Esau forever and not even a remnant would remain.",
