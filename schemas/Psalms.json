    "enDesc": "Tehillim (Book of Psalms) is the first book of the Ketuvim(Writings), the third section of the Tanakh (Bible). The book is an anthology of 150 individual psalms. Many of the psalms are linked to the name of King David, although his authorship was question by the mediaeval commentator Moses Ibn Giqatillah. The book is divided into five books that parallel the five books of the Torah (Pentateuch). There a five genres of Psalms; Hymns, songs of praise for God's work in creation or in history. Communal laments marking a disaster in the community. Royal Psalms pertaining to such matters as the king's coronation, marriage and battles. Individual laments on the fate of the particular individual. Personal thanksgiving psalms to God expressing praises on deliverance from distress. In addition to these five major genres there are communal thanksgiving psalms, wisdom psalms, pilgrimage psalms on their way to Jerusalem; entrance and prophetic liturgies and a group of mixed psalms which could not be assigned to any category.",
