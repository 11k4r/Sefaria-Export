    "enDesc": "Ruth Rabbah (The Great Ruth) is a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the Book of Ruth from Israel. It is divided into eight chapters or sections (\"parashiyyot\"), covering the whole text of the Biblical book, interpreting it verse by verse. Each comment is preceded by a long proem. Its main sources being the Jerusalem Talmud, Bereshit Rabbah, Vayiḳra Rabbah, and Ekhah Rabbati. It would seem, moreover, that its author was opposed to the Babylonian Talmud which he disparages. It was composed shortly after Kohelet Rabbah, between the 5th and 9th centuries.",
