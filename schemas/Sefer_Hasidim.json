    "enDesc": "Sefer Hasidim (Book of the Pious) is a foundation work of the teachings of the Hassidei Ashkenaz (Pious Ones of Germany). This Hebrew book originated between the late 12th and early 13th centuries in the Rhineland, shortly after the Second Crusade. It influenced the distinctive religious practices, Hebrew literary style of Jews in Ashkenaz and also shaped the discourse about Jewish ethics in medieval Europe and beyond. It offers an account of the day-to-day religious life of medieval German Jews, and their customs, beliefs, and traditions. The authentic Ḥasid is described in terms of asceticism, humility, serenity, altruism, and strict ethical behaviour. Though the work is non-systematic, it combines the thoughts of the three leaders of German Hasidism: Samuel the Ḥasid, Judah the Ḥasid of Regensburg (his son), and Eleazar ben Judah of Worms. The book was intended as a religious guide.",
