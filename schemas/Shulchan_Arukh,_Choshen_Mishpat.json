    "enDesc": "The Shulhan Arukh (\"Set Table\") is the most widely consulted code of Jewish law. It was authored in Safed, Israel, by Josef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. The Shulhan Arukh and its forerunner, the Beit Yosef follows the same structure as Arba'ah Turim by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher. There are four sections, each subdivided into many chapters and paragraphs. The rulings in generally follow Sephardi practice whereas Ashkenazi Jews will generally follow the rulings of Moses Isserles whose glosses note the differences in customs. These glosses are widely referred to as the Mappah (\"tablecloth\"). Almost all published editions of the Shulhan Arukh include this gloss, and the term Shulhan Arukh has come to identified as a single work. The first section is Orah Hayyim; laws of prayer and synagogue, Sabbath, holidays;",
