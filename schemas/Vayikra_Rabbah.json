    "enDesc": "Vayikrah Rabbah (The Great Leviticus) is a homiletic midrash to Leviticus. It is referred to by Nathan ben Jehiel (circa 1035–1106) and Rashi (1040–1105). It originated in the Land of Israel and is composed largely from older works.  Its redactor made use of Genesis Rabbah, Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, and the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. It might have been written in 7th Century CE but others place it in the 5th Century. It is not a continuous explanatory interpretation to Leviticus, but a collection of exclusive sermons or lectures on the themes or texts of that book. It consists altogether of 37 such homilies, each of which constitutes a separate chapter. Leviticus Rabbah often refers to Scriptural passages on which the homilies are based as parashiyot and are further designated according to their content.",
