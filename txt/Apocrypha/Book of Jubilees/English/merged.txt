Book of Jubilees



Chapter 1

These are the words of the division of the days according to the law and the testimony for the generations of the years, their weeks and their Jubilees, all the days of the heavens upon the earth as Moses spake by Mount Sinai.
And it came to pass in the first year of the exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt in the third month on the sixteenth thereof, that Moses spoke saying:
Go up to me here toward the mountain and I will give you the two tablets of stone and the law and the commandments that I have written to teach them.
And Moses went up to the mountain of G-d and the glory of the LORD rested upon Mount Sinai covered by a cloud for six days. Moses called from there on the seventh day amidst the cloud.
And he saw the glory of the LORD like a fire consuming upon Mount Sinai when he ascended to take the tablets of stone and the law and the commandments by the mouth of the LORD who said to him: "Ascend to the peak of the mountain".
And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights and the LORD showed him what was, and what shall be.
And he taught him the division of the days according to the law and the testimony saying.
Pay attention to all of the  commandments that I am speaking to you and write it upon a scroll in order that their generations shall know that I forsook them due to all the evil that they did. For they deviated from the covenant that I am enacting today between you and I at Mount Sinai for their generations.
