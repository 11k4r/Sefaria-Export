Megillat Taanit

Chapter 1



Chapter 2



















/Twenty-third of Iyar/ On the twenty-third of Iyar the residents of the Chakra (the fortress built by the Greeks in the time of Antiochus to dominate the Temple Mount) went out from Jerusalem. 
This is what is written “And David conquered the stronghold of Zion which is the city of David.” (Shmuel I 5:7) this is the place of the karaites (?) right now. Since they were troubling the people of Jerusalem and they were unable to go out or in except at night, 
they declared the day they were driven out as a holiday.
