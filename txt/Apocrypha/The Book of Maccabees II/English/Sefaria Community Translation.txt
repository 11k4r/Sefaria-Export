The Book of Maccabees II



Chapter 1

...The Jews in Jerusalem and in the land of Judah to their Jewish brethren in Egypt, peace and salvation!
God bless you, and remember you his covenant with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.
And give you a whole heart to fear him and to serve him with all your heart and all your soul.
God will open your hearts to reflect on His Torah and keep His commandments, and will give you a blessing and peace.
