Lot could see that the angels didn't want to do anything until he left the city.  He thought that since the decree of destruction did not fall upon him, he would be able to withhold the destruction from entering the city (of Sodom) by not leaving it. 
He, therefore, delayed a bit because he thought that the people of Sodom would repent and not be destroyed.
The angels knew that it was the opposite- the punishment wouldn't be delayed because of Lot, and that he would also be consumed by the sins of the city held him and took him out.  The reason for his salvation is because G-d took pity on him - he wasn't able to prevent the destruction, and it was enough for Lot to save himself once he left the city.
