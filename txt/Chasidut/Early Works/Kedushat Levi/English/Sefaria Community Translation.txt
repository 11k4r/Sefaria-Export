Homily for Purim

Remember what etc you were famished and weary, and cut down all the stragglers in your rear: he did not fear God. (Deut. 25:17-18) It seems, that it is not only for this that the seed of Israel is being commanded regarding the erasing of Amalek, which is from the seed of Esav. Rather, every person in Israel needs to erase the evil part that is concealed in one's heart, that is known by the name Amalek. This is because whenever the seed of Amalek is found in the world it is found in the human being, since the human is a small world, and therefore there is a reality to "Amalek", to the force of evil inside every human being, which arises every time to make a human being sin, and is regarding this that the remembrance comes in the Torah. And behold, the strength of the seed of Israel is only found in the mouth, since "the voice, is the voice of Yaakov", [found] in the Torah [study] and in prayer, when a person has this force always burning within towards the Holy One of Blessing, then no evil can control him. But, when a person allows this force to rest then immediately [s/he is under the verse] "and they left Refidim" meaning "their hands became weak [rafah]" and instantly "and Amalek came", instantly evil takes over. But when a person seizes in any instance the character trait of "awe", meaning, one is in awe of the Holy One of Blessing and will not transgress God's commandments, in any instance he won't come to sin. And this is why "you were famished and weary" is written, that you did not have inside you the force of the seed of Israel, that their hands were weakened and did not serve God. "And did not fear God" - and from this you need to remember strongly, so that the force of Amalek will not make you stumble. And this is why it is written "And it was, when Moses raised his hand" (Exodus 17:11) this means the force that is known by the name "hand" - when a person raises that force, then "and Israel prevailed." But when he allowed that force to rest, then - God forbid - "and [the other side] prevailed, etc.

Homily for Pesach






Or one could say, since "You made them all with wisdom", everything in the world was made with wondrous wisdom. Therefore,when the Holy Blessed One changes the orders of creation, it is as if They nullify Their wisdom, as if such a thing could be. This is like the way a father speaks to his young child. The father's love for his child leads him to contract (metzamtzem) his adult intellect and speak with the child according to his capabilities. Similarly, based on the greatness of Their love, the Blessed One performs for us signs and wonders and changes the orders of creation. This is "peh sach", the conversing mouth [discussed in point 5 above as an idea of Passover], from the language of the verse, (Habakkuk 3:6) "the age-old mountains are shattered ("sachu", double meaning 'to converse')" referring to when they descend from their level.

For the Sefira

We need to explain why out of all the mitzvos of the 613 mitzvos , why there is no Shehechianu blessing on the mitzveh of counting the omer.  There is in the writing of the Ariz"l regarding the verse (Shemos 3:12) "You will serve G-d upon this mountain", it is known that when Israel was in Egypt, they were sunken in 49 levels of impurity and The Blessed Holy One, in His Great mercy and kindness, redeemed them from Egypt in order to bring them close, under the wings of The Holy Presence. Because of this, they were required to count 7 cleanings.  Without counting the 7 cleanings, it would not be feasible to bring them close under the wings of The Holy Presence, as is known.  And the explanation of the verse "You shall serve G-d", is that you will perform the 50 [countings] verbally.  We find that there is a constant desire for the counting to be complete and for the closeness to be achieved.  There is a constant desire to complete the days of counting.  If it was feasible to complete the days of counting in one moment and immediately begin the closeness [with The Holy Presence], how good and pleasant it would be.  We therefore find that it is not appropriate to say the blessing of Shehechianu on this [counting due to the desire for the counting to be over with so that we can be close with The Holy Presence].

How good are your tents, Jacob, your dwelling places, Israel - [this can be understood] through "make your Torah (study habits) fixed" - Jacob is a lower level and Israel is a higher level. And this is the explanation of "how good are your tents Jacob", that you make your work temporary. "Your dwelling places, Israel" is your Torah (study habits) should be fixed.

With trumpets and the voice of the Shofar, sound out before Adonai the King (Psalms 98:6). Let us explain in the manner of parable and metaphor - that of a moral king who traveled to a great forest to amuse himself in hunting animals and birds. He came to a valley in the forest and couldn't find the path straight, true path of the king to return home. He saw villagers in the forest and asked them about the path but they didn't recognize the king and they don't know how to answer him. Because they'd never known the straight, true path of the king! Finally, he found a wise and understanding man and asked him about the path. The wise man understood that this was the king and he became shocked and drew back. He heard him and immediately showed him the path, because in his great wisdom he knew the straight, true path of the king, and he took the king to his palace and sat him down upon his throne. He found favor in the eyes of the king, who lifted him up among the ministers of the kingdom, and dressed him in fine clothing, and appointed him to his treasury. After some time, the man sinned against the king and the king became angry and ordered the highest ministers in the kingdom to judge the man according to his transgressions against the king's commandments. The man suffered much because he knew the judgement would go extremely bad for him, according to the manner that he had sinned against the king. He threw himself down before the king and begged for his life and implored him that before the verdict was passed that he might grant a request in one matter: to dress him in his original clothes that he was wearing at the time he took the king from the woods. The king agreed to do so. And so it was that when he dressed the man in those clothes, the king remembered the great kindness the man did did for him in returning him to his palace and sitting him on his throne. His compassion was stirred and he forgave the sin against him and restored the man to his place. Now this has been a parable: so too with us, the people of the House of Israel - that at the time of the giving of the Torah, the Holy Blessed One offered every nation in every language that they might accept the Torah, but they did not want it. But us, the people of the House of Israel, accepted the Torah with great joy and gladness, and we preceded understanding with action. We accepted upon ourselves the yoke of Heavenly Rule and made it our King over us and accepted God's commandments and holy Torah. And now we have trespassed and rebelled against God. And on Rosh Hashanah, we are afraid of the day of judgement, of the hidden verdict against each person according to their deeds. Therefore, we sound the shofar and dress in the clothes we wore at the time of the giving of the Torah, when we accepted the Torah and raised God as our King with the shofar, as it is written, "the voice of the shofar grew louder," (Exodus 19:19). This is in order that God will remember us according to that merit and forgive us our sins and trespasses and exempt us from judgement and write us for a long, good life, amen, may it be God's will.

Teku / let it stand. The acronym: (T) the Tishbite (E) will settle (K) difficulties (U) and problems. And at first glance one has to look closely. Then, of course, everything will be like this after the coming of the redeemer, soon and in our days, amen. But why will Eliyahu settle the difficulties and the problems? Then, of course, call up Moshe Rabbeinu, who gave us the Torah and the commandment and why should he not be the one to settle the difficulties and the problems? And it seems that: Behold! It is written in the book of the generations in the controversy between Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam regarding the Tefillin, that Rashi z’l had Moshe Rabbeinu assisting him, and the Rabbeinu Tam didn’t bother with this and said of him that already He gave us the Torah and turned it over to us to instruct according to what our intellect teaches drawing from the holy Torah. And it seems that: To understand this and explaining this briefly, i.e., with respect to the disagreement of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, the sages said (Eruvin 13b) "both views are the words of the living God," For indeed, there is an aspect where a person learns the basic meaning in the holy Torah according to his own aspect: If he is from the  world of Chesed then everything is pure and permitted and kosher according to what his intellect instructs from the holy Torah, and similarly, the opposite when he is from the aspect of Gevurah then he is in the opposite way. And behold: For Beit Hillel, their attribute was the attribute of Chesed and so Beit Hillel was ruling with leniency, and for Beit Shammai, for he was from the attribute of the Gevurah, therefore Beit Shammai was ruling with stringency. However, in truth, everyone is according to his tier for words of the living God. This is [the point of] "Both views are the words of the living God." And indeed our sages z’l, were after the generation of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel and saw that the world needed to conduct itself in Chesed and they established Halakhah like Beit Hillel in every place, with leniency, like Beit Hillel. And indeed: Who can discern this, i.e. in which attribute should this world be conducted such that Halakhah should be determined in accord with it? It’s the one who is alive, and is in this world; he knows in which attribute this world needs to be conducted! However whoever is not alive does not know at all in which attribute this world needs to be conducted. And behold Eliyahu he lives and endures and does not taste the flavor of death and he is always in this world and therefore he will settle the difficulties and the problems, for he knows in which attribute the world needs to be conducted. And in this, that which Rabbeinu Tam said about Moshe Rabbeinu a’h will be understood that already He gave us the Torah and empowered us to instruct:

Kedusha Rishona

... And it is known, that all the miracles, and all the revelations that were revealed back in the days, are revealed again each and every year. Like on Hanukkah, the miracle of Hanukkah, and the favors that Matiṯyāhu ben Yōḥānān the High Priest received, are revealed to all of us when we light the Hanukkah candles. ...
... We have to understand why they (the rabbis) made a holiday, and established that we should say Hallal and praise, on the miracles of the eighth days of Hanukkah and of Purim, but did not make a holiday on the days of the wars of Sisera (Judges 4), and the wars of Sennacherib (Kings 19), that were also great miracles? ... But (the explanation is, that) only these miracles that are forefather and ancient prophets saw that with our good deeds and action these graces (good revelations) are being revealed again and again, in every year, and in every generation --- those where the days they turned into holidays. And that is why the Talmud says (Shabbat 36) that "on the next year they made it a holiday and established it with Hallal and praise." They mean, that they established that these revelations, and the miracles, and the the graces, will be forever. And with that we bring forward the light (revelation) forever, in every time. And that is what they mean they have "established" it, meaning that they have established it in every generation. [translators note: this is a draft, and incomplete translation]

And now I will explain what our sages said (Shabbat 21b) "The mitzvah of the Chanukah light is from when the sun sets until the foot stops in the marketplace"; and also of the name Chanukah. Know, that the miracles that the Blessed Creator did for us have three types, because there are hidden miracles and there are revealed miracles. Revealed miracles, like the ones done for our ancestors in Egypt, like the ten plagues, and the splitting of the Reed sea, that are breaks with nature and all see as miracles. And there are hidden miracles, like in the days of Esther and Mordechai, as it is in nature that in the beginning [the king] raised Haman and then loved his wife and killed his friend because of his wife, and also the miracle mentioned in the prayer Al HaNisim, of delivering the many into the hands of the few etc. And behold the hidden miracle, that they were in the way for war, and also the deed of Yehudit had a little aspect of nature, even though in truth they were miracles, and not natural occurrences but they were hidden miracles, not revealed ones. And so it is explained in the book Ohr Hadash, which was written by the author of Gur Aryeh, that the Chanukah miracle had an aspect of nature. And also the admo"r the holy light mohr"r, Dov Ber z"l said that a revealed miracle like in Egypt is called "a day that illuminates all". And behold, the hidden miracles are divided into two aspects. One aspect, like Purim, [is when] the Holy Blessed Name, Godself, causes every event and turns the actions, without any activity on the part of the lower ones until the advice of the evil Haman was completely cancelled, and he got his just desserts, and saved us from the hand of the tyrants, and the lower ones did not do anything. And that Esther invited Haman is what the sages z"l said (Megilah 15b) "so that Israel would not say our sister etc, or so that both him and her are killed etc and other reasons. But in Chanukah the lower ones took a few actions, because the Hashmonai and his sons waged the war of Hashem and were active, yet that the Holy One did not do just the ways of nature and "delivered the strong in the hands of the weak, etc" but with some help of the lower ones.  There you have the three levels. The miracle of the exodus from Egypt was a modification of nature, and is called day and a great miracle. And smaller than Egypt is Purim, that was in its essence a little hidden miracle, and it is called night as I have written in the name of the admor"r z"l but there was no help from the lower ones. And smaller than Purim is the lights of Chanukah, which was a hidden miracle and also had help from the lower ones. Therefore, as I explained above, after Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Shemini Atzeret - first comes Chanukah, and after that Purim, and after that Pesach, because we raise in holiness and do not lower, because we continue the revelation of the miracles and kindnesses of Chanukah that they are not so great, as a hidden miracle with help from below in the wars of the Hashmonai and his sons. And after that we raise in holiness and receive the revelation from the kindnesses and miracles of Purim which was a hidden miracle without intervention from below, and so it is greater than Chanukah. And after that we raise in holiness and receive a greater revelation in the miracles and kindnesses of Pesach, in which the miracle was revealed and looks like a day to everyone. And look into the Ramban at the end of Parashat Bo and beginnign of parashat Vaera and end of parashat Lech Lecha, that he brings up hidden and revealed miracles.


And behold the Blessed Creator, Whose Name is Blessed, is the Ruler of it all, and one who is Ruler renews the world as is God's will, and there is no such a thing as nature and "the way things are" [regel], but the only thing that there is is the Creator of Blessed Name renewing nature, and canceling nature as God sees fit. And God does not say "what it is is what will be, what was yesterday will be tomorrow", no, at each and every day the Holy One of Blessing renews all of God's creatures, as [we say in prayers] "God in goodness renews every day the deeds of Creation", as established by the Men of the Great Assembly. And this, that [the time of the mitzvah is] "until the foot/regel stops in the market" is that we accept that the Holy One rules everything, for all times, and that God is the Renewer and that we believe that the hidden miracles are not just part of nature, but that God renews the world at all times and moments. What happens is that sometimes God renews nature as the six days of Creation, and sometimes God renews something completely new, like a revealed miracle. The person who accepts  hidden miracles has to accept that God renews everything, even the fixed natural world. And this is Chanukah, an expression that comes from "renew of the altar", from the word "new" - that we accept hidden miracles and that God renews even the fixed nature in the world, and that the world does not follow [regel] fixed rules, God forbid. And this is lightning Chanukah candles, that is to say that this aspect, that God renews the world constantly at every moment and time will be brought to light. And that this aspect will illuminate our consciousness and purify our hearts to be of service to the Holy One of Blessing, in Whose hands we are. And [also] the aspect I wrote above, that God continuously created and renewed the world. And what I wrote now, that even after the Creation of the world God renews constantly what seems immutable in nature. And this is [what we say in morning prayers] "You are the One before the world was created, and You are the One since the world was created": You are the Ruler that renews nature at all times. And this is "Hashem melech, Hashem malach etc [God is ruler, God ruled]" - sit with this and understand.
