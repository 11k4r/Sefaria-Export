Bereshit



 Another explanation of "Bereshit": two beginnings [b   reshit] - The Holy Blessed Name makes the Flow flow and we, with our prayers, do a contraction on the Flow, every one according to their desire. This one does a contraction with the letters LIFE for life. And this one with the letters WISDOM for wisdom. And this with the letters WEALTH for wealth, and so for all goodness according to their will. And behold, for everything that exists in a spiritual level there exists a correspondent to the physical level. And behold in the physical level there is sound, and speech, the sound is the general and the speech is the contraction of the sound into the letters of speech. And behold the same [happens] on Rosh Hashanah: the sound of the shofar is the Flow from the Blessed Creator, that is the general. And what we say, Malkhuyot, Zikhronot, Shofarot is the contraction that we make of the Flow of the Blessed Creator with the letters - every person according to their will, behold, the Flow that flows in general from the Blessed Creator is the aspect of Written Torah, and this that we do, the contraction of the Flow with the letters is the aspect of Oral Torah, since Oral Torah is in the will of Israel, as they do the explanation of the Written Torah. And this is two beginnings [reshit], Written Torah and Oral Torah.

Homilies for Chanukah

In Kislev falls Chanukah. Kislev corresponds to Yaakov, and through Yaakov came miracles, as it is known, and therefore a miracle happened in this month, which is the third month counting the beginning of the year from Tishrei. [Kislev] corresponds to Levi in tribes, and therefore a miracle happened through the hands of the Kohanim, the Hasmonean and his sons, since the kohanim are from the tribe of Levi.
The general rule is, on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur the Holy One of Blessing remembers Yisrael for good, and only on Chanukah Yisrael sees the good in the mind and in thoughts (intellectually). This is because the expression "eyes of the congregation" is explained by Rashi z"l as "sages of the congregation" (see Rashi on Bamidbar 15:24) and therefore in Chanukah, [the miracle is celebrated] by lights, since this is an expression of seeing/vision, and after that Purim [the miracle is celebrated] in speaking, since we read the Megilah, and on Pesach [the miracle is celebrated] in deed, which is eating matzah. And therefore Chanukah is [celebrated using] vision, and is on the month of Kislev, connected to "the inhabitants of Cnaan saw" (Gen. 50:11), which teaches regarding seeing.
The dedication [chinuch] of the Tabernacle was on the first day of Nissan. The dedication of the First Temple was on Tishrei, the dedication of the Second Temple was on Kislev, each of them according to its aspect. The miracles that happened in the Tabernacle were connected to Nissan, and that is why the dedication happened on Nissan. And in the Second Remple the Hasmonean miracle was in Kislev, and therefore the dedication was on Kislev, and the dedication of the First Temple was on Tishrei. The general rule of the Tabernacle was that the body understands that there is a Creator of the World, Blessed! And the Temple is that the soul (neshamah) understands that there is a Creator of the World. And this, that the soul understands the that there is a Creator of the World happens on Tishrei because of the pardoning of sins, and then the soul comprehends the Creator of the World; and in Nissan the body understands that there is a Creator of the World because through all the miracles and wonders the body understands. And therefore the Temple is called "Eternal Place" [Beit Olamim see I Kings 8:13] because the soul is [complete] existence, and the body is not [complete] existence. And this is the hint of what our sages z"l said: "From where do we know that the Temple is called Tabernacle, and Tabernacle is called Temple?" (Eruvin 2a) because in truth this, that the body experiences enjoyment, it is also that the soul experiences enjoyment, since the existence of the body is also the existence of the soul in this world, to serve the Creator, Blessed, and Blessed the Name, and this, that the soul does, that the soul serves the Blessed Creator is also enjoyment for the body. And this is the hint in Tabernacle, that is the body, that is called Temple, and Temple, that is called Tabernacle. And sit with this thought.
And we will explain, with help from Heaven, what our sages z"l said: "regarding the light of Chanukah they dispute, one says it is permissible to make use of its light, another says it is forbidden" (Shabbat 22a) [we will explain] through a parable. A great king came to the house of a poor person, and in the regular way of things when a great king arrives we see [to him] honor due to his riches and greatness. And behold the poor person also becomes happy when they see the immensity of the king's riches, since never in their lives have they seen such riches together. And the poor who is wise does not get happy when they see the immensity of the king's riches, because they know that regarding the king being rich is a small thing, what brings such a poor happiness is the fact that they merited the coming of the king being a guest in their house. So too this thing, that as the Blessed One make miracles with human beings, one is happy due to the good that came to that person individually, that the Holy One of Blessing did specifically for them, and they are similar to the poor that becomes happy when they saw the riches of the king. So one is happy that the Holy One of Blessing did these things for him, and the other does not become happy due to miracles, because the other knows that the Holy One of Blessing created all worlds and is able to do any and every thing. That person's happiness is because they see that when the Holy One of Blessing does a miracle, it really is that the Holy One of Blessing is, as it were, garbing Godself in humans, and so that person is as the poor person who is happy because such a great king came to be that person's guest, and is, as it were, garbing Godself to come into human beings. And this is the dispute of "one says it is permitted to make use of the light" - that corresponds to the person who is happy that the Holy Blessed Name did a miracle for that person, and this is happiness of this world. The one to whom the Holy Blessed Name gave goodness, [and sees] the world as given to enjoy, says it is permissible to use the light. And the "one who says it is forbidden to make use of the light" - that corresponds to the one that is happy because he merited that God garbed God's clear light in human beings, and does not think of oneself at all, that they received goodness, [that person is only happy] that they merited that the Holy Blessed Name garbed Godself in that person, and since that person thinks that this world is nothing, only [directs oneself] upward from the world, does not [see] that the world is to enjoy, since "no eye has seen God, only You" (Isaiah 64:3), then that person thinks that is forbidden to make use of the light.
In the Shemone Esre we say "and regarding all Your miracles that are every day with us" - with us, precisely, in that we act through our actions that You will make miracles with us. "And for Your wonders and Your goodness that are every moment, evening, morning and midday" and "with us" is not mentioned, because we do not cause [them] rather that [God] makes them flow due to God's lovingkindness, as it were, without any arousing from below. And I will explain to you, with help from Heaven, that the miracles from the Exodus from Egypt were made by the Holy Blessed One through God's great lovingkindness without any Lower Arousing, which is not the case with Hanukkah. Those miracles were a little bit also due to the lower ones, since the Hashmonai and his sons were fighting with valor the evil Antiochus, may his name be erased. Therefore we say in Hanukkah "May the favor of the Lord, our God, be upon us. let the work of our hands prosper, prosper the work of our hands!" (Ps. 90:17) - to hint that the miracle of Hanukkah was brought a bit by the works of our hands, in the war, despite the fact that the Blessed Name prospered the work of our hands, that the Holy Blessed One made us successful through the works of our hands, that we won the war.
In Daniel it is written that the kingdom of Antiochus is similar to a goat (see Daniel 8:5) and in the zemirot of Shabbat it is said: "the goat grew its strength" (Baruch Hashem Yom Yom, see also Daniel 8:8) because  the goat ('ez) is the one that is insolent (m'eiz) as our sages z"l in the second chapter of Beitza that that is why it is called ez (Beitzah 25b), and you don't have a greater insolent that the kingdom of the evil Antiochus, that lead more than any other, as it is known: whoever transgresses the command of the king in his house is a greater leader than one who transgresses the command of the king outside the house, and so this insolent wanted to make everyone transgress the will of the King inside the Temple, and while it was standing, and this was not the case with the Egyptians, or the Medes and Persians, that then there was no Temple at all, and that is why he is called the great goat, because he was the greatest insolent.
What we pointed out as a difficult in the book "Kedushat Levi", which we wrote, namely: why did they made a yearly celebration of the miracle of Hanukkah, but not of Gideon and Hezekiah. And it is possible to answer that the downfall of Sancheriv and Sisera was on Passover, as it is mentioned in the Agadah and midrashim, however, if that is so, why did they made a yearly celebration of the miracle of Haman, that is Purim - wasn't Haman hanged on Passover?[...]
On Hanukkah we light 36 candles, and the Service of Below arouses Above to light 36 lights, and 36 of Above with 36 of Below is 72, corresponding to the 72 Names of the Blessed One, and counting the shamash we get 44, and with corresponding 44 from Above we get 88 [פ"ח]. And the hint behind 88: "the trap פח broke and we were saved" (Ps. 124:7). Through the trap that was broken, the kingdom of Antiochus, we cause Below and Above to light 88 lights, and therefore the Arizal wrote that the first letters of "We set our hope on the LORD, נפשינו חכתה לה'" (Ps. 33:20) is 88 [נ+ח+ל], and so we light the lights of Hanukkah, the letters of פ"ח, see there. And this is due to the fact that the first letters of the blessing of the candles of Hanukkah are also 88, a hint to the 88 lights as we explained above.
Our sages z"l said "the lightening makes the mitzvah" (Shabbat 22b). This is to say that a person needs to become a flame (set oneself on fire, become ardent) in their service, and this is the lightening, and because the ardor can be for empty things, the tzadik only becomes ardent for holiness, and this is called resting since rest [ie setting] is called 'the vessel in which the love is inserted', that by the insertion of the love into the vessel there is resting of the love that rests upon the thing. And this is 'one who says resting [setting the candles] makes the mitzvah', that the lightening will insert love into the vessel, that will become ardent in its service, and this is what the true sages hinted at that the setting the candles is the character trait of kingship, that through this [one is] making the Creator king, by becoming ardent there is rest in the service to the Blessed Creator.
In the writings of the Ari, z"l, regarding the secret of the 36 candles of Hanukkah and the connection with the 8 shamashim, behold that makes 44, which corresponds to the name Ehyeh אהי"ה in degrees, that is, א' + א"ה + אה"י + אהי"ה + - which is in gematria 44, and adding the name itself, 45, and behold it is 88 with the kollel (?), which is the first letters of "to light the Hanukkah light"; up to here are his words. And on a general overview it is not understood, what is the idea behind adding those two names to the issue of Hanukah light? I think it can be explained as follows:

Homily for Purim

Remember what etc you were famished and weary, and cut down all the stragglers in your rear: he did not fear God. (Deut. 25:17-18) It seems, that it is not only for this that the seed of Israel is being commanded regarding the erasing of Amalek, which is from the seed of Esav. Rather, every person in Israel needs to erase the evil part that is concealed in one's heart, that is known by the name Amalek. This is because whenever the seed of Amalek is found in the world it is found in the human being, since the human is a small world, and therefore there is a reality to "Amalek", to the force of evil inside every human being, which arises every time to make a human being sin, and is regarding this that the remembrance comes in the Torah. And behold, the strength of the seed of Israel is only found in the mouth, since "the voice, is the voice of Yaakov", [found] in the Torah [study] and in prayer, when a person has this force always burning within towards the Holy One of Blessing, then no evil can control him. But, when a person allows this force to rest then immediately [s/he is under the verse] "and they left Refidim" meaning "their hands became weak [rafah]" and instantly "and Amalek came", instantly evil takes over. But when a person seizes in any instance the character trait of "awe", meaning, one is in awe of the Holy One of Blessing and will not transgress God's commandments, in any instance he won't come to sin. And this is why "you were famished and weary" is written, that you did not have inside you the force of the seed of Israel, that their hands were weakened and did not serve God. "And did not fear God" - and from this you need to remember strongly, so that the force of Amalek will not make you stumble. And this is why it is written "And it was, when Moses raised his hand" (Exodus 17:11) this means the force that is known by the name "hand" - when a person raises that force, then "and Israel prevailed." But when he allowed that force to rest, then - God forbid - "and [the other side] prevailed, etc.

When Betzalel constructed the Tabernacle and all its ‎components, i.e. the menorah which represented the attribute ‎of love, the table which reflected the attribute of awe, and the ‎furnishings representing other Divine attributes, those attributes are contained in the Torah, and the Torah is the essence of the Creation of the Universe.‎ Our sages (Berachot 55a) alluded to this when they said: ‎Betzalel knew how to combine the letters with which the heaven and earth were created. This enabled ‎Betzalel to fashion the various furnishings of the Tabernacle so ‎that they reflected the attributes which we mentioned. Betzalel did not know, ‎however, to which particular commandment in the Torah each ‎one of the vessels he fashioned corresponded - meaning, this vessel represents love, and is also represented in this mitzvah, and so on for all the mitzvot and all the other vessels. So Betzalel would just make the vessels that represented the attribute of awe, and so too with all the other vessels that point out the rest of the attributes. It was therefore left ‎for Moshe our teacher, PBUH, connected each vessel ‎ to a commandment in the Torah, in which there was that attribute. And this is the establishing of the Mishkan, that Moshe could not do alone, meaning, connecting the Mishkan to the mitzvot of the Torah. And this is the reason they dismantled the Mishkan when they went through the desert and set it up again when they stopped, because it is known that Israel would go through the desert to raise the sparks that fell in the externals [klipot] there in the desert, to raise them to holiness. And from the Ba'al Shem Tov it is known that the raising of those sparks happens when we see something physical, and needless to say even when it is something evil, G-d forbid, then we can serve the Holy Blessed Creator in that in this thing there is love or awe or the rest of the attributes, and through that we can raise that thing. Meaning, when something shows evil love, the good love that is in it can be rescued - the love that the Holy Blessed One has for this world - only through the love for the Blessed Creator such sparks are raised. And so too with the rest of the attributes, that is, the attribute of awe to the awe of Hashem, when we see that in this place there is evil awe, G-d forbid, then we can raise it to holiness, and all the other attributes can be raise in this fashion. And behold the dismantling of the Mishkan is that the attributes are not connected to the mitzvot, and this is when they were walking in the desert, and when they came to a place in  which there was love that was not good, then they could arouse the love, meaning, the love of Hashem, which is the essence of Love, and so too with the attribute of awe, and the attribute of harmony, as explained. And after raising that love, and that awe, then they set up the Mishkan, meaning, they connected the attributes with the mitzvot of the Holy Blessed One. When a person has within Love of Hashem, or Awe of Hashem and does not do the mitzvah in which that attribute is contained, then the Love and the Awe are not established in the world, but when the person does the mitzvah which contains that attribute, then there is establishing [in the world] of that attribute. And therefore they established the Mishkan after they raised the sparks, and then they made the attributes cling to the mitzvot, and through this they represented the establishment of the Mishkan so it would have a permanent establishment in holiness, and this, Moshe our teacher alone could not accomplish, to establish the Mishkan, to connect the mishkan with the Torah.

Homily for Pesach




<b>Blessed be the Omnipresent, Blessed be He [...] Corresponding to four sons did the Torah speak:</b> The ARI (R. Yitzchak Luria), may his memory be blessed, wrote on the verse (Isaiah 6:2), "with two he covered his face, with two he covered his legs, and with two he would fly": That principle that it is forbidden for a person to investigate what his intellect cannot grasp about the service of the divine, God forbid - and that it is like heresy about a fundamental principle, like the statement of our Sages, may their memory be blessed, (Hagigah 11b), "It is forbidden, etc. what is above" - that is, "with two he covered his face." And, "with two he covered his legs," is that a person should not say, if so, I will not investigate even that which his intellect grasps. That is forbidden. Just the opposite! A person must investigate what his intellect grasps. However to investigate that which his intellect does not grasp - that is forbidden! Because in truth, God, may He be blessed, is without end (Ein-sof), so it is impossible for any created being to grasp Him. (The end of this is missing.)

Or one could say, since "You made them all with wisdom", everything in the world was made with wondrous wisdom. Therefore,when the Holy Blessed One changes the orders of creation, it is as if They nullify Their wisdom, as if such a thing could be. This is like the way a father speaks to his young child. The father's love for his child leads him to contract (metzamtzem) his adult intellect and speak with the child according to his capabilities. Similarly, based on the greatness of Their love, the Blessed One performs for us signs and wonders and changes the orders of creation. This is "peh sach", the conversing mouth [discussed in point 5 above as an idea of Passover], from the language of the verse, (Habakkuk 3:6) "the age-old mountains are shattered ("sachu", double meaning 'to converse')" referring to when they descend from their level.

For the Sefira

We need to explain why out of all the mitzvos of the 613 mitzvos , why there is no Shehechianu blessing on the mitzveh of counting the omer.  There is in the writing of the Ariz"l regarding the verse (Shemos 3:12) "You will serve G-d upon this mountain", it is known that when Israel was in Egypt, they were sunken in 49 levels of impurity and The Blessed Holy One, in His Great mercy and kindness, redeemed them from Egypt in order to bring them close, under the wings of The Holy Presence. Because of this, they were required to count 7 cleanings.  Without counting the 7 cleanings, it would not be feasible to bring them close under the wings of The Holy Presence, as is known.  And the explanation of the verse "You shall serve G-d", is that you will perform the 50 [countings] verbally.  We find that there is a constant desire for the counting to be complete and for the closeness to be achieved.  There is a constant desire to complete the days of counting.  If it was feasible to complete the days of counting in one moment and immediately begin the closeness [with The Holy Presence], how good and pleasant it would be.  We therefore find that it is not appropriate to say the blessing of Shehechianu on this [counting due to the desire for the counting to be over with so that we can be close with The Holy Presence].

With trumpets and the voice of the Shofar, sound out before Adonai the King (Psalms 98:6). Let us explain in the manner of parable and metaphor - that of a moral king who traveled to a great forest to amuse himself in hunting animals and birds. He came to a valley in the forest and couldn't find the path straight, true path of the king to return home. He saw villagers in the forest and asked them about the path but they didn't recognize the king and they don't know how to answer him. Because they'd never known the straight, true path of the king! Finally, he found a wise and understanding man and asked him about the path. The wise man understood that this was the king and he became shocked and drew back. He heard him and immediately showed him the path, because in his great wisdom he knew the straight, true path of the king, and he took the king to his palace and sat him down upon his throne. He found favor in the eyes of the king, who lifted him up among the ministers of the kingdom, and dressed him in fine clothing, and appointed him to his treasury. After some time, the man sinned against the king and the king became angry and ordered the highest ministers in the kingdom to judge the man according to his transgressions against the king's commandments. The man suffered much because he knew the judgement would go extremely bad for him, according to the manner that he had sinned against the king. He threw himself down before the king and begged for his life and implored him that before the verdict was passed that he might grant a request in one matter: to dress him in his original clothes that he was wearing at the time he took the king from the woods. The king agreed to do so. And so it was that when he dressed the man in those clothes, the king remembered the great kindness the man did did for him in returning him to his palace and sitting him on his throne. His compassion was stirred and he forgave the sin against him and restored the man to his place. Now this has been a parable: so too with us, the people of the House of Israel - that at the time of the giving of the Torah, the Holy Blessed One offered every nation in every language that they might accept the Torah, but they did not want it. But us, the people of the House of Israel, accepted the Torah with great joy and gladness, and we preceded understanding with action. We accepted upon ourselves the yoke of Heavenly Rule and made it our King over us and accepted God's commandments and holy Torah. And now we have trespassed and rebelled against God. And on Rosh Hashanah, we are afraid of the day of judgement, of the hidden verdict against each person according to their deeds. Therefore, we sound the shofar and dress in the clothes we wore at the time of the giving of the Torah, when we accepted the Torah and raised God as our King with the shofar, as it is written, "the voice of the shofar grew louder," (Exodus 19:19). This is in order that God will remember us according to that merit and forgive us our sins and trespasses and exempt us from judgement and write us for a long, good life, amen, may it be God's will.

Teku / let it stand. The acronym: (T) the Tishbite (E) will settle (K) difficulties (U) and problems. And at first glance one has to look closely. Then, of course, everything will be like this after the coming of the redeemer, soon and in our days, amen. But why will Eliyahu settle the difficulties and the problems? Then, of course, call up Moshe Rabbeinu, who gave us the Torah and the commandment and why should he not be the one to settle the difficulties and the problems? And it seems that: Behold! It is written in the book of the generations in the controversy between Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam regarding the Tefillin, that Rashi z’l had Moshe Rabbeinu assisting him, and the Rabbeinu Tam didn’t bother with this and said of him that already He gave us the Torah and turned it over to us to instruct according to what our intellect teaches drawing from the holy Torah. And it seems that: To understand this and explaining this briefly, i.e., with respect to the disagreement of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, the sages said (Eruvin 13b) "both views are the words of the living God," For indeed, there is an aspect where a person learns the basic meaning in the holy Torah according to his own aspect: If he is from the  world of Chesed then everything is pure and permitted and kosher according to what his intellect instructs from the holy Torah, and similarly, the opposite when he is from the aspect of Gevurah then he is in the opposite way. And behold: For Beit Hillel, their attribute was the attribute of Chesed and so Beit Hillel was ruling with leniency, and for Beit Shammai, for he was from the attribute of the Gevurah, therefore Beit Shammai was ruling with stringency. However, in truth, everyone is according to his tier for words of the living God. This is [the point of] "Both views are the words of the living God." And indeed our sages z’l, were after the generation of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel and saw that the world needed to conduct itself in Chesed and they established Halakhah like Beit Hillel in every place, with leniency, like Beit Hillel. And indeed: Who can discern this, i.e. in which attribute should this world be conducted such that Halakhah should be determined in accord with it? It’s the one who is alive, and is in this world; he knows in which attribute this world needs to be conducted! However whoever is not alive does not know at all in which attribute this world needs to be conducted. And behold Eliyahu he lives and endures and does not taste the flavor of death and he is always in this world and therefore he will settle the difficulties and the problems, for he knows in which attribute the world needs to be conducted. And in this, that which Rabbeinu Tam said about Moshe Rabbeinu a’h will be understood that already He gave us the Torah and empowered us to instruct:

Kedushot for Chanukah

Kedusha Rishona

... And I will discuss the calling of the name "Chanukah". Behold, according to the clear meaning, Purim should also be called "Chanu Yad" [kah כה has numerical value 25, yad יד has numerical value 14]! And I will give a reason to praise the words of Chaza"l who also called it Chanukah. It is also necessary to give a reason why they established the reading of Megillat Ester to publicise the miracle that happened in the days of Mordechai and Ester, and didn't establish the reading of a megilla to read the miracle of Matityahu ben Yochanan, the High Priest, and of Yehudit, which Hashem Yitbarach did for them within the evil kingdom of Greece. For is it not known that we count the year from Tishrei, so Chanukah precedes Purim, and then Pesach and then Shavuot? And behold, is it not known that all th miracles and revelations, which were revealed back in the ancient days, are revealed again each and every year. Like on Hanukkah, the miracle of Hanukkah, and the favors that Matiṯyāhu ben Yōḥānān the High Priest received, are revealed to all of us when we light the Hanukkah candles. And on Purim, the miracles and kindnesses that were revealed in the days of Mordechai and Ester, so too are they revealed in each and every year. And so too the revelation of Shavuot; the holiness of the giving of the Torah is revealed in each and every year. And so too with Rosh haShanah, the revelation of the creation of the world is revealed, as is explained in the writings of the Ar"i, and so they established the blessing "who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time". And see the Ta"z in siman 682, subsection 3 105, who connects it to the phrase "at this time", and see there that he brings the phrase "at this time" in the name of the Levush.
But for me, the inexperienced and insignificant, it appears to me according to its simple meaning: that behold, it's necessary to understand why it was made a Yom Tov and why Hallel was established and praise about the miracle of the eight days of Chanukah - and Purim was not made a Yom Tov, and the wars of Sisera, and the day of the wars of Sancheriv, which was a great miracle, that Blessed God wanted to make Chizkiyahu the Mashiach, etc, and with the excess of miracles which are every day. Rather, the miracle that our ancestors and the original prophets and men of the Great Assembly saw, that they also exerted force in our good deeds, that these kindnesses which are revealed every year and in every generation and illuminate these miracles, according to the greatness of their deeds which the original ones did...
... We have to understand why they (the rabbis) made a holiday, and established that we should say Hallal and praise, on the miracles of the eighth days of Hanukkah and of Purim, but did not make a holiday on the days of the wars of Sisera (Judges 4), and the wars of Sennacherib (Kings 19), that were also great miracles? ... But (the explanation is, that) only these miracles that are forefather and ancient prophets saw that with our good deeds and action these graces (good revelations) are being revealed again and again, in every year, and in every generation --- those where the days they turned into holidays. And that is why the Talmud says (Shabbat 36) that "on the next year they made it a holiday and established it with Hallal and praise." They mean, that they established that these revelations, and the miracles, and the the graces, will be forever. And with that we bring forward the light (revelation) forever, in every time. And that is what they mean they have "established" it, meaning that they have established it in every generation. [translators note: this is a draft, and incomplete translation]

And now I will explain what our sages said (Shabbat 21b) "The mitzvah of the Chanukah light is from when the sun sets until the foot stops in the marketplace"; and also of the name Chanukah. Know, that the miracles that the Blessed Creator did for us have three types, because there are hidden miracles and there are revealed miracles. Revealed miracles, like the ones done for our ancestors in Egypt, like the ten plagues, and the splitting of the Reed sea, that are breaks with nature and all see as miracles. And there are hidden miracles, like in the days of Esther and Mordechai, as it is in nature that in the beginning [the king] raised Haman and then loved his wife and killed his friend because of his wife, and also the miracle mentioned in the prayer Al HaNisim, of delivering the many into the hands of the few etc. And behold the hidden miracle, that they were in the way for war, and also the deed of Yehudit had a little aspect of nature, even though in truth they were miracles, and not natural occurrences but they were hidden miracles, not revealed ones. And so it is explained in the book Ohr Hadash, which was written by the author of Gur Aryeh, that the Chanukah miracle had an aspect of nature. And also the admo"r the holy light mohr"r, Dov Ber z"l said that a revealed miracle like in Egypt is called "a day that illuminates all". And behold, the hidden miracles are divided into two aspects. One aspect, like Purim, [is when] the Holy Blessed Name, Godself, causes every event and turns the actions, without any activity on the part of the lower ones until the advice of the evil Haman was completely cancelled, and he got his just desserts, and saved us from the hand of the tyrants, and the lower ones did not do anything. And that Esther invited Haman is what the sages z"l said (Megilah 15b) "so that Israel would not say our sister etc, or so that both him and her are killed etc and other reasons. But in Chanukah the lower ones took a few actions, because the Hashmonai and his sons waged the war of Hashem and were active, yet that the Holy One did not do just the ways of nature and "delivered the strong in the hands of the weak, etc" but with some help of the lower ones.  There you have the three levels. The miracle of the exodus from Egypt was a modification of nature, and is called day and a great miracle. And smaller than Egypt is Purim, that was in its essence a little hidden miracle, and it is called night as I have written in the name of the admor"r z"l but there was no help from the lower ones. And smaller than Purim is the lights of Chanukah, which was a hidden miracle and also had help from the lower ones. Therefore, as I explained above, after Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Shemini Atzeret - first comes Chanukah, and after that Purim, and after that Pesach, because we raise in holiness and do not lower, because we continue the revelation of the miracles and kindnesses of Chanukah that they are not so great, as a hidden miracle with help from below in the wars of the Hashmonai and his sons. And after that we raise in holiness and receive the revelation from the kindnesses and miracles of Purim which was a hidden miracle without intervention from below, and so it is greater than Chanukah. And after that we raise in holiness and receive a greater revelation in the miracles and kindnesses of Pesach, in which the miracle was revealed and looks like a day to everyone. And look into the Ramban at the end of Parashat Bo and beginnign of parashat Vaera and end of parashat Lech Lecha, that he brings up hidden and revealed miracles.


And behold the Blessed Creator, Whose Name is Blessed, is the Ruler of it all, and one who is Ruler renews the world as is God's will, and there is no such a thing as nature and "the way things are" [regel], but the only thing that there is is the Creator of Blessed Name renewing nature, and canceling nature as God sees fit. And God does not say "what it is is what will be, what was yesterday will be tomorrow", no, at each and every day the Holy One of Blessing renews all of God's creatures, as [we say in prayers] "God in goodness renews every day the deeds of Creation", as established by the Men of the Great Assembly. And this, that [the time of the mitzvah is] "until the foot/regel stops in the market" is that we accept that the Holy One rules everything, for all times, and that God is the Renewer and that we believe that the hidden miracles are not just part of nature, but that God renews the world at all times and moments. What happens is that sometimes God renews nature as the six days of Creation, and sometimes God renews something completely new, like a revealed miracle. The person who accepts  hidden miracles has to accept that God renews everything, even the fixed natural world. And this is Chanukah, an expression that comes from "renew of the altar", from the word "new" - that we accept hidden miracles and that God renews even the fixed nature in the world, and that the world does not follow [regel] fixed rules, God forbid. And this is lightning Chanukah candles, that is to say that this aspect, that God renews the world constantly at every moment and time will be brought to light. And that this aspect will illuminate our consciousness and purify our hearts to be of service to the Holy One of Blessing, in Whose hands we are. And [also] the aspect I wrote above, that God continuously created and renewed the world. And what I wrote now, that even after the Creation of the world God renews constantly what seems immutable in nature. And this is [what we say in morning prayers] "You are the One before the world was created, and You are the One since the world was created": You are the Ruler that renews nature at all times. And this is "Hashem melech, Hashem malach etc [God is ruler, God ruled]" - sit with this and understand.
