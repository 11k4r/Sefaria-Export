Ketonet Pasim

Vayikra



Tzav



























































































And with this, it is understood [why] it was necessary to write two warnings (negative commandments) - “nothing fermented (chametz) is to be seen with you; and no leaven is to be seen with you” (Exodus 13:7). For it is to destroy two types of evil impulse: The one of arrogance is called leaven, as mentioned earlier; and the one of lowliness, listlessness and inappropriate modesty without thought is called chametz. As there is only a [slight] something differentiating chametz from matza (they are spelled with almost all of the same letters). And matza is called the bread of destitution (Deuteronomy 16:3), as it is submission and humility with thought - thought being called something. But chametz is modesty without thought, as mentioned above. And it is simple to understand.
