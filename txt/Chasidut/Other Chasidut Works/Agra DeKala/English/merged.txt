Permutations of Bereshit



Bereshit


An additional reason why the holy Torah starts with the letter Beis, which the numerical value is two, is to teach that there are two Torahs, there is written and oral.

<b>To Yetzer, the Yitzri family. To Shalem, the Shilmi family.</b> A resonance of this verse was told to me in the name of the holy rabbi the Maharza"v (may the memory of the righteous and holy be a blessing), which was said in the name of his father the holy rabbi the Mahari"m (may the memory of the righteous and holy be a blessing), that this pasuk refers to the urge [<i>yetzer</i>]. For when a person desires to follow the advice of their [evil] inclination in any matter, the "family of the inclination" -- many families, and many supports, does the inclination have to [persuade one] to follow it. "To Shalem", that when a person wishes to walk in wholeness [<i>shleimut</i>]of service, the family of wholeness... as stated above. And it completes it, this is its language, and it says this also "To Tachan, the Tachani family" (Numbers 26:35) -- when a person wishes to pray and plead [<i>lehitchanein</i>], then it is the Tachani family, as stated above.
