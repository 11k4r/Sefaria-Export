Genesis

Bereshit



Section 1




Rashi quotes "Rabbi Yitzhak said: The Torah should have started at "From this very month..."...the first mitzvah...[because of] 'the strength of His deeds...". One must understand the solution given regarding all of the Torah portions from Bereshit until "...this very month". The interpretation of the matter is that the essence of the Torah is the mitzvot--this is the written Torah--but the Holy Blessed One wanted to clarify that this world and the entire Creation [exists] because of the 'power of Torah', as it says "B-reishit": He looked within the Torah and created the world [according to it]." And this matter [is in contrast] with Oral Torah, which is dependent on human activity. Thus, all the Torah portions concerned with the stories of forefathers [are there] to show how Torah was created by their deeds. This is what is meant by "the strength of His deeds"--the power that the Holy Blessed One suffused within Creation. This is why it is called "the work/deed of Creation" to declare that the world was created with ten utterances, and the life-force of the world by means of the Torah. The task of humanity, then, is to understand that every deed is a result of the Holy Blessed One's life-force. When a person performs any action, it is [only] because of the power of Torah to fulfill the will of the Creator, thus renewing the light hidden within Creation. This is hinted at in the verse "I have put my words in your mouth...who laid the foundations of the earth and say to Zion 'You are my people'." The sages interpret the verse: Don't read ami/my people--rather immi/with me, as a partner in the work of Creation. The Zohar interprets 'Zion' as the inner point within all things as a imprint and sign to remember that the Holy One is [the source] of all things. This is the life-force which animates all things. The person who clings to this inner point and all of His life-force which flows from this point becomes a partner in the work of Creation. As a result of this ..."in order that He might give them the inheritance of the nations”--an inheritance without restraints. When a person joins the natural world to its active potential, nature cannot obscure the power of holiness.

Section 1





The Rambam noted a difficulty in our parsha - that God says "Go forth..." without first mentioning why Avraham in particular was so precious as to receive such a command. It appears to me that the holy Zohar sees this very fact as what makes Avraham praiseworthy. He heard the call of 'go forth' which comes out from God to all people at all time, as it says 'oy to those who sleep in their holes (and do not hear)!' Our father Avraham heard the call and received its message. Perforce the Divine word was calling to him alone, because there was no one but he listening. Certainly this itself is his greatest praise - that he was ready to receive the call.

On the verse "And Yaacov wrestled.. until dawn", our Rabbis commentated that they made a cloud of dust that reached the throne of glory. Yaacov's portrait is engraved under the throne of glory, as it is written, "Give truth to Yaacov" and God's seal is truth. This is the portrayal of Yaacov, from which all of Am Yisrael come from as it is written, "all come from the seed of truth". This world is the world of lies, and truth can cannot fully appear, as the midrash tells us "truth said – don’t create a world of lies". There is opposition to the facet of Yaacov under the throne, Eisav and his power. As the midrash connects the name Eisav "עשיו" to the word "שוא" – worthless and unreal. Bnei yisrael, via the Torah which is truth, as our Rabbis teach "there is no truth but Torah" , and so "give truth (to Yaacov)" is in the present tense, as everyday Bnei Yisrael have a revelation what the truth is via the Torah. Bnei Yisrael's task is to reveal truth in the world of lies

R’ Elazar of Worms says in his work ‘the Rokeach’ that the thirty-six candles we light on Hannukah parallel the thirty-six hours for which the original light of the six days of creation shone, before it was hidden away. If this is so, then it appears that each Hannukah candle draws from the or haganuz, the hidden light of creation, and gives light in great darkness, as our Sages hinted with their description of the or haganuz as a light which shined from one end of the world to the other (Chagigah 12a). There is no hiddenness or obscurity (he’elem) before this light. We call the world (olam) which obscures (ma’alim) and hides this light ‘the natural,’ but the original light of creation shone through all these layers of concealment and it was hidden away for the righteous; on this it is written “A light shines for the upright in the darkness…” (Psalms 112:4) It is also written “The people that walked in darkness have seen a brilliant light…” (Isaiah 9:1) The generation which lived in the days of the wicked Greeks walked in darkness, as the Sages taught “darkness refers to Greece which darkened the eyes of Israel…” (Bereshit Raba 2:4), nevertheless they served God with a spirit of self-sacrifice even in the midst of this darkness. That is why they merited that the hidden light shine for them, and some of its illumination remains, radiating from year to year even in these lowly times. Every servant of God must rejoice during these days when a touch of the hidden light illuminates Divine service. The primary intent of the wicked ones was to make us forget God’s laws and Torah, and the Hannukah lights bring us to remembrance.

In the verse, 'Thus shall you say' etc., for the 'women [...] with gentle language' etc., 'and tell [...] harsh matters'. And there's a difficulty, that with one expression being said, according to Rashi, 'in this language and in this order'. And perhaps one could say that really these words are for women and those who are lacking understanding. They are only words of encouragement how the Holy One, blessed be He, brought us close and uplifted us. But people that understand, know that this is not a small thing and that they are receiving with this, a great and awesome yoke to serve the Creator of the world and to clarify his kingdom, may it be blessed, in the world. And therefore it says with this expression and in this order that it was revealed before Him, may He be blessed, that with this expression each person will continue according to their path. The women with encouragement. And the men with an awesome undertaking. And in the Gemora we also find a disagreement whether commandments were given to us to derive benefit from. And the law is that they weren't given to us to derive benefit from, as mentioned above.

"And Mordechai returned to the gate of the king" etc. Our sages say, may their memory be blessed, that he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. The explanation for 'and he returned' is that he returned in repentance. This is the way of the tzadik {righteous}, through which he is assisted by HaShem, may He be blessed. He subjugates himself further through the shame from before Him, may He be blessed. And Mordechai regretted that he caused the whole decree. And now HaShem, may He be blessed, did a kindness like this for him. He became further ashamed. And he returned/repented. Because certainly, repentance through the shame is not like that like before {one has shame}. That there are two (ways of gaining) humility. Firstly, through worthlessness {that a person understands that he is worthless}. And the second, through greatness as it is written elsewhere {that a person realises his greatness - who he is and what he has - and  realises that he doesn't deserve  any of it}. And this is the difference between a tzadik {righteous person} and a rasha {a wicked person} as it is written "and Haman went out etc." ... "happy and with a good heart" because of the feast. And this was his downfall. But by Mordechai it says 'and he returned/repented' as written above. Furthermore it is apparent that Mordechai knew that HaShem, may He be blessed, will certainly help the Jewish people as it is written "relief and deliverance" etc. And so it's written "and he knew all that had happened" etc. However through this way, that all tzadikim {righteous}, that even though they know of the salvation, nevertheless they are able to cry out with a truly complete heart as if they didn't know. And someone that isn't {on that level}, the true salvation isn't shown to him. And this is dependent on complete faith that one nullifies his intellect to HaShem, may He be blessed, and he knows and believes that there is no contradiction in any of this, that the salvation arrives through the outcry of man. Even though HaShem, may He be blessed, will not forsake the Jewish people, without question. Nevertheless it is necessary to cry out in a time of distress as it is written "a time of distress" etc. and from that, one will be saved.

In the verse, 'Like the practice of the land of Egypt' etc., 'my judgements' etc., 'to follow/walk in them'. Rashi explains 'you are not permitted to be exempt' from them. As it's written 'like' the practice, not actually 'the practice' of the land of Egypt. Because the Bnei Yisroel were already a holy congregation and what is the relevance to warn them from acting like these sinners? But the explanation (comes to teach us) that there should not be any act of a Jew that is like/similar to the acts of the wicked that all their acts are for worldliness alone. Rather the Bnei Yisroel need to sanctify all their actions to cleave to the source of the life-force and to take from it life-force. Because the action needs to be only for the purpose that man 'walks' in the service of HaShem (may He be blessed) and simple Jews are directed to eat and drink to add strength in their service of the Creator which is also a general (form of) 'walking'. And what also of the righteous that all their actions are for the sake of Heaven, and so too with every commandment that a person does, it needs to be directed (one should perform it with the intent) that through this (the performance of the commandment) he will come to greater holiness that he could add at all times from one (spiritual) level to the next (spiritual) level. Like (the concept that fulfilment of a) 'commandment brings another commandment'. And it won't be that the commandment was done simply to be discharged from the obligation, rather on the contrary, that through the merit of this, one will receive (the opportunity for) other commandments, as it's written, that the reward for (fulfilling a) commandment is (the opportunity to fulfil another) commandment. And this is what it means 'to follow/walk in them' etc., and to take from them life-force as it's written 'and live (by) them' (or possibly, and life is within them).

Sefat Emet – Rabbi Yehudah Leib Alter of Ger, translated by Rabbi Arthur Green
“Take unto yourselves the fruit of the goodly tree.” (Lev. 23:40)
Scripture also says: “Tell me the ways to live, to be sated with joy in Your presence.” (Psalms 16:11). Lulav is numerically equal to hayyim (life), Israel desire the true life of their inner selves. This is what it means to be “sated with joy” – the more deeply you take life into your heart, the more you are sated. This happens through the lulav and the species that accompany it. Israel actually point to God, taking in the light of the Sukkah, which is given to them as a gift. When the King invites guests, he gives them what their heart desires. “Whoever invites someone does so with the intent that they eat and drink.”
That is why God says to us: “Take unto yourselves,” meaning that we should choose life for ourselves…Awareness for the whole year comes about on Sukkot, the last of the three “legs” on which the year stands. The mitzvah of Sukkah stands on its own, but the lulav/species represent the awareness that Israel receive and take into the depths of their hearts…5:181

Regarding the verse (Vayikra 25:55) “The Children of Israel are servants to Me; they are my servants…” My claim came before [any other claim]. This is still true today, for according to the level at which one accepts the yoke of Heaven, enslavement to governments is removed, as our sages have taught (Avot 3:5), “One who accepts the yoke of Torah, has the yoke of government removed.” There are also roles of servant and child… [The roles of servant and child] parallel the aspects of Torah and commandments, for one who engages in Torah [as a child of G-d] is free. (Avot 6:2) However, everyone must accept the yoke of Heaven and of commandments upon themselves [as a servant]. This is the meaning of the verse, “They are My servants”, as it is written “Israel, in whom I am glorified.” (Isaiah 49:3) It is glorious for G-d when Israel accepts servitude to Him, despite being His children. It is not only praise of Israel, but it is also true testimony to the Creator… There are always levels of servant and child, servant and child, in that the greater one’s grasp of the secrets of the King [as G-d’s child], the more one lowers one’s self to accept the yoke of Heaven as a servant. Consequently, one merits to see and grasp, as a child, and then one returns to being a servant… In Nisan, we become free and receive the yoke of Heaven. All the days of the Sefirah, we are like servants, doing His will, until we achieve seven complete weeks, which is the oath we swore and in which we have stood since Mount Sinai. We then merit on Shavuot to receive the Torah, like children who search through the vaults of the king. However, we then return to being servants, which is Sukkot, when we return and repent on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, and accept the yoke of Heaven anew, which is the glory mentioned above, as the Holy One finds glory in them…Similarly, daily, one accepts the yoke of Heaven [as a servant] in the morning and thereby merits Torah [as a child] according to his level. And at night, one returns to accept the yoke of Heaven. And the level of the “second servant” is greater, as can be understood.

Regarding the Reading of the Book of Ruth on Shavuot:
This is really about the Oral Torah. The Kadosh Barukh Hu wants the children of Israel to expand the Written Torah through their deeds--for we know that the deeds of the righteous are “Torah”. Through the deeds of Boaz and Ruth, a scroll was produced by Divine Guidance. 
It is written “And Elohim said...saying”, meaning: the children of Israel said words like these to themselves. It’s also written “who gave us a Torah of truth, and within us, planted eternal life”--this refers to Oral Torah,  the unique quality of Torah which is Israel’s. They have a unique intellectual approach to understand secrets within the Torah which are hidden and not explicit within the Torah itself. 
This itself is the matter of Boaz, whose name means Bo Oz--strength within him--that is to say, he had deep faith in the words of the Sages who explained “an Amonite--excluding an Amonitess”. He had no doubt in the matter, like Ploni did who said “lest I endanger my inheritance”. On the contrary! He was ecstatic to show that the interpretation of the Rabbis was the Torah given on Sinai. 
“Trust in the Sages” is the foundation of Oral Torah, and this is what is meant by “Truth and Trust”. Written Torah is explicitly exoteric. Yet, it is the will of the Divine that in this downcast world, Israel achieve ‘truth’ by way of ‘trust’.
The ego gives itself over to remove that trust from a person. It makes it seem in one’s eyes as though they are alienated from Hashem Yisbarakh, and tells them that it is arrogant to even try to seek Hashem Yisbarakh in silent prayer, and the like. But the truth is the exact opposite! Seeking God at all fosters the fear of Heaven. 
One should contemplate to see that it is in no way disgraceful to contemplate the trivialities of the world for “the entire world is filled with His Presence”. How could someone be ashamed of pondering that what is His true desire?
Now what emerges is the reason that Israel wished to hear the first two commandments from God Himself: to believe the truth of God as the lifeforce of every human being. As it says “I am the Lord your God”--literally, all of your lifeforce. That’s why it is addressed to the second person singular, for the innermost life force of every Jew is is the same point which gives life to all of creation as it is says “You ‘give life’ to all things”. Thus our Sages taught: A person should always see themselves as if the Holy Presence abides in one’s insides.”, for a holy person should be able to uncover the holy presence within themselves. A person doesn’t create something new by some sort of deed, rather she reveals the innermost life force within her as it says “And He breathed into his mouth life breath”. If a person can believe in this life force, to not forget about it,  and always strive to cleave to the root of this life force, they can merit the “truth by means of trust”, mentioned above. 
One should believe that as the Holy One said “Let there be light”, that the light can shine one more day. Just as God said “I am the Lord your God”, there is a divine life force in every Jew.

5664. ...
From the holiday of Shavu'ot. 
They established [reading of] Ruth on Shavu'ot, to say that, by means of B'nai Yisrael being chosen through the Giving of the Torah, they are instruments to draw near the converts, because B'nai Yisrael are called the First of His Crop which is the fruit for which everything was created. This is as it says (Gen. R.), "B'reishit -- for the sake of Israel which is called 'reishit.'" The meaning is that "reishit" is the beginning and the inner essence, as it says (Prov.), "The 'reishit' of wisdom is the awe of God." Therefore it is called the Day of Bikkurim, when the fruit is ripe. But B'nai Yisrael "are excepted from the generality in order to teach to the entire generality" (Sifra, principles of R' Yishma'el), as it will be in the future (Zeph. 3:9), "For then I will make the peoples pure of speech, etc. [so that they all invoke Adonai by name and serve Him with one accord]." And then (Eccl. 7:8) "The end of a matter is better than the beginning of it" [see Ruth 3:10]. And in truth, according as B'nai Yisrael elevate from the nations, they are themselves exalted even more. And this itself is the meaning of putting "na'aseh" before "nishma," for B'nai Yisrael understood this, that they were chosen in order to draw everyone near, and they said (Ex. 24:7), "Everything that Adonai has spoken we will do." It is written here "na'aseh" and it is written there (Gen. 1:26), "Na'aseh adam," as it says (Gen. 12:5) "the souls that they had made," which Onkelos translated "that they had subjugated to the Torah", and it is through this that "we will hear." As it is with the particular -- as the improvement [tikkun] of the deeds, in order to draw each physical deed close to the spirit so that the soul shines in the person -- so it is in general -- as the improvement [tikkun] of K'lal Yisrael to draw near from the nations, so that the Torah shines in them. It is written (Micah 7:20), "You will give truth to Ya'akov, hesed to Avraham," for B'nai Yisrael are in truth God's portion and His Torah, but it is also part of the aspect of Truth to do hesed, to bring near those who are far off and who come for the sake of Heaven: "truth to Ya'akov" is the Torah, "hesed to Avraham" is that we should draw close also from the descendants of Lot -- Ruth the Moabite....

On the eighth day, this is an Atzeret for you – a gathering in. For Sukkot is the Festival of ingathering. And the Children of Israel, when they bring themselves together in the name of heaven – in order that their should descent upon the Succah the name of heaven, their end shall be that they shall sustain and remain in this state of Achdut/Oneness. And this is the meaning of this is an Atzeret for you – that you should remain in Oneness. And so all gatherings, this is their explanation – if they gather for the sake of heaven, they shall remain sustained even as each one goes to their own home. And so to on the holy Shabbat – they are drawn into Oneness, and if this is for the sake of heaven, they shall so be sustained in the days of action. So too the Oneness from Sukkot goes with us also home.
