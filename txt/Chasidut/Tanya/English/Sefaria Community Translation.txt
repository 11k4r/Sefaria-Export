Introduction



Part One, The Book of the Average Men

Chapter 1

We learned [in Niddah, end of chapter 3 (30b)]: "An oath is issued to him (A Jew before his birth), (charging him to) be righteous, and not (to be) wicked, and even if everyone in the world tells you 'you're righteous," view yourself as (someone who's) wicked.'" But one has to understand this. For have we not learned, "Do not consider yourself wicked."! What's more, if one will be wicked in his own eyes he feel bad and be sad, and he will be unable to serve God with joy and a glad heart. And if he should not be grieved by this at all, this could lead to frivolity, G0d forbid!
So the matter is as follows: We find in the Talmud five different types of people. A righteous person [tzaddik] who has good, a righteous person [tzaddik] who has evil; a wicked person [rasha] who has good, a wicked person [rasha] who has evil; and a intermediate person [beinoni]. 
And the sages explained in the Talmud, that the 'righteous person who has good' is the perfectly righteous person [or the perfect tzaddik]; the 'righteous person who has evil' is a person who is righteous but not completely [or the imperfect tzaddik]. And in Raya Mehemna he explains, that [in the description of] 'a righteous person who has evil' [not that there is something evil about him, rather] - that any evil within him is completely mastered by his goodness, etc.
And in the Talmud: "The righteous [tzaddik] are judged by their good inclination etc., the wicked [rasha] are judged by their evil inclination, while the intermediate person [beinoni] is judged by both inclinations etc. Said Raba, 'For example, I am an  intermediate person [beinoni].' Said Abaye to him, 'Our master has left no life for any creature.'"
So to understand all of this clearly. and also to understand a  statement of Job's, "Master of the Universe, You have created righteous men and You have created wicked men." [how can this be correct] when righteousness and wickedness are not predestined?
Also, we need to understand what is the true nature of this intermediate person [beinoni]. For certainly he is not someone whose deeds are half meritorious and half sinful [that he spent half his life doing good and half his life doing evil] for if that were the case how could Raba mistake himself for an intermediate person [beinoni]? It is known that his lips never ceased reciting words of Torah, to the extent that even the Angel of Death could not overwhelm him. Then how would he make such a mistake to consider himself [an intermediate person [beinoni] unless 'intermediate' means fully righteous in behavior and not] half sinful? 
Additionally, [an intermediate person cannot be one who is half sinful, for] in the moment that one sins he is considered completely wicked [complete rasha]. (If afterwards he returns to righteousness [he repents from his sin]  he is considered completely righteous.) Even someone who violates a minor rabbinic prohibition is considered wicked [rasha]
This being  so, we must conclude that the Beinoni is not even guilty of the sin of neglecting to study torah. This is why rabbah mistook himself for a Beinoni.








The souls of the nations, however, emanate from the other, unclean (Kelipot) which contain no good whatsoever. As written in Etz Chayim (portal 49 chapter 3) that all the good that the nations do, is done out of selfish motivations. So the Gemara comments (Bava Batra 10b.) on the verse (Mishlei 14:34), "The kindness of the nations is sin"- that all the charity and kindness done by the nations of the world is only for their self-glorification. etc.

Chapter 2

The second, uniquely Jewish, soul is truly "a part of God above," as it is written: "and he blew into his nostrils a soul of life"(Genesis 2:7); "And You blew it into me." (Siddur, Morning Prayer). It is written  in the Zohar "he Who blows, blows from within him," that is to say, from his inwardness and from  his innermost being. For it is is of his inward and innermost vitality that a man emits through blowing with force.















Now, if the person sanctifies himself, he will bring forth a holy garment for the soul of his child. However great a soul may be, it still needs the father's sanctification (at the time of intercourse.) 
But the soul itself, it sometimes happens that the soul of an infinity lofty person comes to be the son of an ignoble and lowly person. etc. All this has been explained by Rabbi Issac Luria of blessed memory, in Likutei Torah on Parsat Veyera, and in Taamai HaMitzvot on Parshat Bereishit.
