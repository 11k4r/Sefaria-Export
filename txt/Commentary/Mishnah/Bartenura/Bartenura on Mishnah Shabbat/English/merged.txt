Mishna 5

If he was born during twilight, he is circumcised on the ninth day as it is the eighth day from the morrow; if twighlight is still considered day, he is thus circumcised on the ninth day. If the day (preceding the twighlight during which he was born) is Friday, he can't  be circumcised on the following Shabbat in case it is the ninth day and it is a postponed circumcision which does not supersede Shabbat, he must wait until after Shabbat and be circumcised on the tenth day.
