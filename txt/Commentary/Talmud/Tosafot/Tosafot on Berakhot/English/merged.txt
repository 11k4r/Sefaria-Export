Verses twice and translation (Targum, i.e. Aramaic translation) once - Some explain that the requirement [of reading a translation] applies to foreigners in their (native) language, as it is like (Aramaic) Targum that sometimes explains the verses. Because, just as the (Aramaic) Targum explains [the verses] to the Amei Ha'aretz (literally, "People of the Land"), so too, foreigners understand [the translation of the verses] through their native tongue. However, this does not appear [to be a correct], since the (Aramaic) Targum explains items that cannot be understood from the Hebrew, as can be found in many places. [For example], Rabbi Yosef said, (Megillah 3a) "If it were not for the (Aramaic) Targum of this verse, I would not know what it is speaking of." Therefore, one should not recite [the translation] in any language the third time (i.e. after the verses are read in Hebrew twice), except for the language of the (Aramaic) Targum.

In the Talmud Yerushalmi the reason is explained: Rabbi Boon said, it says "in order that you may remember [the day when you came out of the land of Egypt] all the days of your life"  - when you are engaged in life and not days when you are engaged with death. There is also a version which says 'exempt from reading the Shema and from prayer and from T'fillin."

According to Rashi, you do not need to bless. And understand from his explanation that if one wants to bless, it is permitted. However, in the Yerushalmi it says, if you want to be stringent, we don't let him. Therefore, it appears to say, one does not bless and one is not permitted to bless, and the Yerushalmi explains why, and says because of Kavod HaMeit (respect for the dead). Alternatively, because he doesn't have anyone who will carry his burden. We ask a question: but isn't it taught in a Braita: exempt from netilat lulav. And should you think we are dealing with Yom Tov, and there he is not too busy to carry the burden, and we teach that it is referring to Chol, meaning Chol HaMoed [because he could potentially bury on Chol]. But isn't it taught in a Braita: 'Exempt from the blowing of the shofar'. It should have said on a weekday and not on Yom Tov. And that's a question. And we answer: Rav Chanina said, since he needs to prepare the casket and the shrouds [which the dead wear], as it is taught in a Mishnah: "you may violate the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds" its as if he is carrying the burden. Consequently, the implication is that on shabbat and yom tov you are not permitted to make blessings and pray since you are busy violating the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds. But there is a question from the end where it says "on shabbat you make blessings and a mezuman.

Hence it is deduced that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of one engaged in prayer – whether in front of them, behind them or on the side of them.  The Teshuvat Geonim explain that that this is only if one is sitting idly, but if they are engaged in the recitation of Shema or something similar, even if they are sitting it is okay.
