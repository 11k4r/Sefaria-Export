Verse 1

"To Horeb, the mountain of God"—Thus wrote Moses. And the reason it is "Horeb" (i.e. dry) is because of the great heat, for rain did not fall there, because it was close to Egypt, [only] a three day's walk, as Moses spoke. And because the Nile was far away, there was no moisture there, and the dryness prevailed. 

Verse 2

"And he saw": There are those who interpret "belabat esh" as "belehavat esh", but the correct interpretation in my view is that it means "in the heart [labah = lev] of the fire" since this is what we find [in Ezekiel 16:30] "How weak was your heart [libah]". And R. Adonim [=Dunash] says that if that were the case, it should have a hiriq under the lamed [i.e. libah], as in "el ginat egoz" [Song of Songs 6:11]. But he has forgotten "ukheganah zro'eha tatzmiah" [Isaiah 61:11]. "The bush": the sage says this was a sort of thorn bush.

Verse 24

And it happened in the way - They had a tradition that an eight-day son should not be circumcised if he was sick or traveling since there wasn't a possibility for delaying the travel. And this was because Moses could not be delayed in his Divine mission. He saw by his own counsel not to circumcise, since the youngster would be in danger if he was put to travel. And behold, HaShem sent an angel to remind Moses to pause himself and circumcise the child and go on his way on his own. And the youngster would stay with his mother until he healed, and behold the reason of "he met him" is that sickness from HaShem came to Moses that he didn't think of it. And this is "he sought to kill him" if he didn't circumcise his son. And due to the trembling that seized him he wasn't able to circumcise his son, and Tzipporah circumcised him, because he revealed to her the secret. And do not be surprise to read "HaShem met him" because it was an angel/messenger of HaShem. And like [this verse, we have] "And HaShem walks in front of them during the day" (Exodus 13:21) and there it is written "And God's angel traveled" (Exodus 14:19). And Rav Shmuel ben Chofni says God forbid that God would want to kill Moses, who goes in a Divine mission to save his people! He just wanted to kill Eliezer. And the sign is that "he met him" and "he wanted to kill him", and after "him" is explained to be Eliezer, because it is written "the foreskin of her son", and this is not explicit in the beginning, since his name had not been given yet. And like [this verse, we have] "And it was on her giving birth, and he put his hand" (Genesis 38:28)

Verse 3

One can ask , if Hashem hardened his heart what was his sin? The answer is that Hashem gave wisdom to man, and placed insight into his heart to be able to draw additional power to increasegood, or to detract from his evil, as i will explain later .......But the reason for the hardening of his heart is to increase My miracles. Rabbi Yeshua states the reason was to allow him to suffer the plagues, and he speaks incorrectly.

Wisemen of astronomy.
Magicians. Those who change the appearnce of something.
Sorcerers. Those who know the secrets of created matter. The word is quadrilateral (with four root letters, and therefore not Hebrew). Perhaps it is an Egyptian word, or Akkadian (Babylonian/Chaldean), because similar words have been found in scripture only from those languages.
The text distinguishes between Moshe's act, in which the staff truly transformed into a snake, and the act of the sorcerers, which is why the text states "belateihem". The word has a trilateral root, it's meaning is as "the flame (blade) of the sword", "I lay burning", "the day that comes shall burn them". It connotes flashing and passing fire, namely illusion.

It's possible to say that Moshe was screaming out to Hashem. And this can't be right because He already spoke to him when saying ואכבדה בפרעה. It only talks about Moshe when it says that he was next to all Bnei Yisroel. In the past when BneiBnei Yisroel screamed out to Hashem.

“...or that [is] in the Earth beneath...” [All] that is beneath the heavens, as that of the image of a multitude, they have distinct divisions and He implored thus also in the waters. 
And he spoke the scriptures to the land below. For the Sea and the Earth are one ball.
