Malbim on Jeremiah

Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6


I cannot speak, for I am a child. This was for three reasons: 1. That the child (Jeremiah) did not have confidence in himself in front of greater people, 2. That the child did not know how to order his words in the correct way (meaning he did not know how to speak well in front of the congregation), and 3. That maybe the nation will become angry with what he says and come upon him and kill him.

Verse 1

"Ishmael came" etc.
"Of the royal seed," This is one reason for which he killed him. Since he was of the royal seed he thought that the governorship was due him.

Verse 2

"And smote Gedaliah," etc.
"whom the king of Babylon had made governor," consequently he killed him, because he was sent by the king of the sons of Amon who hated the king of Babylon and wanted the land of Israel to be under his rule,
"and they smote...and he slew him," they [all] smote him and Ishmael completed his death with his [own] hands.
