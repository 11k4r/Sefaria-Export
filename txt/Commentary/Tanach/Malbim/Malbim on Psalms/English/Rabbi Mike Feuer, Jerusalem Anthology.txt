Verse 1

A song, a psalm – This psalm is founded on the great storm that occurred at that time which shattered mountains and broke rocks. Even though the storm raged on Mount Zion as well nothing there was harmed because the Lord who dwells on this mountain protected it. This storm was for the good of Israel, because at that time the kings of the land joined together and came from Tarshish in ships to conquer the land of Israel. This storm broke their ships and drove their armies into the sea. This psalms is closely related to psalm 46.

That men may declare – That is to say, to develop all mortal man that they will declare afterwards the name of the Lord and His praise in Jerusalem in the future, when all nations and kingdoms gather together to serve the Lord. The phrase ‘the name of the Lord’ indicates the spread of His name as creator of the world, renewer and controller. This will be declared in Zion because the wisemen and the priests reside there, who know the name of the Lord. ‘His praise’ refers to His ways and guidance which are merciful and filled with grace. This will be known even to the masses who reside in Jerusalem, through the whole city.

Verse 1

A song of ascents of David – This psalm is speaking the praise of Jerusalem. It describes the nation in its totality as one body made up of different individual limbs and Jerusalem as “a city that was joined together within itself…” (Psalms 122:3) The individual limbs join together to become a whole body which can contain the spirit of life, an intellect and a Godly soul. The House of God is located within her and it is the vessel which prepares the whole body to receive the Divine Presence and the Godly soul. The city itself is like the heart and brain within the body, which prepare it to receive the vital force and the intellect. In light of this it says “I rejoiced when they said to me, ‘Let us go to the house of the Lord,’” because there God dwells and He makes the Divine Presence and Godliness to come to rest in holiness.

Verse 6

Request – It has been explained that Jerusalem is that which upholds the connectivity of the wholeness of the body and its unity. Now goes on to say that just as if asked about the welfare of the personal body one would reply that its peace depends on whether its limbs and powers are connected and in peace with each other, because at the moment one divides between them then death comes, so too if one asks after the peace of Jerusalem the answer is that her peace depends on the tranquility of those who love her. The peace of Jerusalem depends on whether there is inner tranquility between those who love her. This is because the primary essence of Jerusalem is the unity of the nation, and if this is so then if strife and struggle arises between her people and an estrangement of hearts there will be no peace found for the city. Her primary peace is herself with herself “…like a city that was joined together within itself,” (Psalms 122:3) and not if they are divided. There is a difference between peace and tranquility, because peace is and external peace and tranquility is an inner tranquility. Thus the psalm says that through Israel having inner tranquility, which is why is calls them her lovers because there is love between them even if they have no peace from their external enemies, this will bring about the external peace of Jerusalem.

You will receive this blessing from the whole and you will also strive for the good of the whole. and see the good of Jerusalem – to see the good of Jerusalem and the success of the whole. Through this all the days of your life will be special, because you will devote all your days to the good of the whole, to see their happiness and good:

Until I find a place for the Lord – 1] That the place be found where the Sanctuary will be built, as it is written “And it will be, that the place the Lord, your God, will choose…” (Deuteronomy 12:11) and they did not know at first where the chosen place was. 2] dwellings for the Mighty One of Jacob, aftert he place is found the Sanctuary, where the Lord will dwell permanently, will be built. Since the fact that the Lord will dwell on earth in a particular place was revealed to Yaakov in a dream, and he said “This is none other than the house of God…” (Genesis 28:17) therefore the verse says ‘for the One of Jacob.’ So too, just as Yaakov swore an oath there and said “Then this stone, which I have placed as a monument, shall be a house of God…” (Genesis 28:22) the psalm says “…he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob.” (Psalms 132:2)
