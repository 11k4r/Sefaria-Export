<b>"And for me, this is my covenant:"</b> He means to say, "Upon this I will make a covenant with them, 'says the Lord.'" And [then] he explained what he made the covenant upon and said, "The spirit of prophecy that rests upon you - you, Israel - and the words of Torah that I placed in your mouth to teach them, behold these two 'will not depart from your mouth, etc. says the Lord,' such that they will not depart 'from now and forever' until the end of all the generations."
