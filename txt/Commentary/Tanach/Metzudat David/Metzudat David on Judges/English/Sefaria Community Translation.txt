The wife of Lappidoth. That is to say, a woman of valor, zealous in her deeds as a torch afire. And this a matter of figurative language, as when it is said about a person. 
She judged. On account that she was a prophet and zealous in her deeds, this elevated status came to her; thus, she was judging Israel.
