Verse 2

From Zion, the finery of beauty – As it says in the prophecy of Yoel (4:16), “And the Lord shall roar from Zion, and from Jerusalem He shall give forth His voice…” as if from there He sends out His voice that everyone should come to Jerusalem.

Verse 1



Verse 2

The Lord loves the gates of Zion – It says ‘gates’ because the elders and the wise sit in the gates, as it says “…up to the gate, to the elders…” (Deuteronomy 25:7) and so too in the words of Boaz which describe the elders who were at the gate. (Ruth 4:11) Even though God loves all of the dwelling places of Yaakov, as it says “How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!” (Numbers 24:6) nevertheless He lowves the gates of Zion more because there the wise are occupied with the service of Gd.

Verse 1



Verse 2

The Lord is great in Zion – Then He will be great in Zion because there He will be magnified above all the nations when He executed judgement on the wicked. In the midrash Shachar Tov it says: The Lord is great in Zion, when He returns His Presence to Zion, in that moment He is great.
