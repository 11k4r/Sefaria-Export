Fragrance - Satisfying before I asked to make my will. Rashi. And the Rab did not explain what about the fire. And in Gemara (Zevachim 46:b) is said: To exclude unfinished burning, and explains here that we sacrifice on condition to place it over the campsite burning fire, not to place it over the coals that chill and go dim. And I see that it needs to be consumed completely over the fire, and not to let a small leftover, and it relates to a rebellious son issue (Sanhedrin 70a): Like midcooked thieve's meat; (Eruvin 29b)Neither cooked nor consumed. And there are some that explain there:  To exclude unfinished burning, his intention was to place over wood fire, as it is written over the fire on the wood, and not over straw fire nor mulch fire, as we learn (Shabbat 36b): finished oven with straw and mulch. And behold, in this sacrifices verse is said  fragrant fire to God.

<b>And the land was defiled and I visited the iniquity upon it and the land vomited:</b> The verse was strict with sexual immorality because of the land that became defiled with them and vomited the souls that do [it]. And behold [the laws of] sexual immorality are a personal obligation and they do depend on the land, but the secret of the matter is in the verse (Deuteronomy 32:8-9), "In the Most High's giving inheritances to the nations, in His separation of people, the borders of the peoples were set up, etc. For the portion of the Lord is His people, etc." And the matter is that the honorable God created everything and placed the power over the ones below in the ones above and placed over each and every people in their lands according to their nations a star and a specific constellation as is known in astrology. And this is that which is stated (Deuteronomy 4:19), "that the Lord, your God, distributed them to all of the peoples" - as He distributed constellations in the skies to all of them. And above them he placed the highest angels to be their ministers, as the matter that is written (Daniel 10:13), "And the minister of Persia stood across from me"; and it is written (Daniel 10:20), "And behold the minister of Greece is coming." And they are [also] called kings, as it is written (Daniel 10:13), "And I remained alone there with the kings of Persia." And behold the honored God is the God (Power) of powers and the Master of masters of the whole universe, but upon the land of Israel - the center of the [world's] habitation, the inheritance of God [that is] unique to His name - He did not place a captain, officer or ruler from the angels, in his giving it as an inheritance to his nation that unifies His name - the seed of His beloved one. And this is what it stated (Exodus 19:5), "and you will be for Me a treasure from all of the nations, as all of the world is Mine"; and it is written (Jeremiah 11:4), "and you will be for Me a people and I will be for you a God" - that you should not be to other gods (powers) at all. And behold, He sanctified the people that dwells in His land with the holiness of [the laws of] sexual immorality and with a multitude of commandments, that they should be [dedicated] to His name. And therefore it stated (Leviticus 20:22), "And you will guard all of my statutes and all of my judgments and do them and the land will not vomit you out"; and it is written (Leviticus 20:24), "And I said to you, 'You shall inherit their land and I will give it to you to inherit it, I am the Lord, your God, that separated you from the nations" - it is stated that He separated us from all of the nations, over which He placed ministers and other powers, in His giving us the land, such that He, may He be blessed, that He be the Power for us and that we be designated to His name. And behold, the land that is the inheritance of the honorable God vomits out all that defile it and it does not tolerate those that worship idols and engage in sexual immorality. And this section mentions the (idol) Molekh, to include idol worship with the mention of sexual immorality; and about them all, it states (here), "Do not become defiled with all of these, as the nations became defiled with all of these[...] and the land vomited out its inhabitants." And so [too], it stated in the second section (Leviticus 20:24), "And I said to you, 'You shall inherit their land and I will give it to you to inherit it, I am the Lord, your God, that separated you from the nations." And behold, outside of the land - even though everything belongs to the honorable God - purity is not complete in it, because of the servants that rule upon it. And the nations err after their ministers, to worship them also. And hence, the verse states (Isaiah 54:5), "He will be called the God of all the earth," as he is the Power of powers that rules over everything. And (Isaiah 24:21) "He will govern" in the end "over the host of the heights in the heights" - to remove the government of the high ones and to destroy the system of servants; and afterwards, He will govern "over the kings of the earth on the earth." And this is the matter that is written, that he said (Daniel 4:14), "By the decree of the wakeful ones is the matter, and by the word of the holy ones is the sentence" - it is stating that that thing which was decreed on Nevuchadnetsar is a decree of the watchful ones (the matter and by the word of the holy ones is the sentence) that they decreed upon the forces that emanated from them to do this. And they are called "wakeful ones," as it is from their emanations that the forces are awoken to to do all of the actions; as he said (Daniel 4:10-11), "and behold a watchful one and a holy one came down from the Heavens. He called out loudly, and so did he say, 'Cut the tree, etc.'" "And by the word of the holy ones is the sentence (question)," which is to say that they asked what is the will of the Most High, and afterwards they decreed to do this. And this is what Daniel said to him (Daniel 4:21), "it is a decree of the Most High"; as everything is from Him, may He be blessed. And behold the honorable God, may He be blessed, is the Power of powers outside of the land and the God of the land of Israel, which is the inheritance of the Lord. And this is the explanation of [the phrase] (Deuteronomy 31:16), "and stray after the gods foreign to the land," as the deities are foreign in the land of God and in His inheritance. And this is [the understanding of] what is stated (II Kings 17:26), "they did not know the law of the God of the land and He sent lions against them, and behold, they kill them because they do not know the law of the God of the land." And behold the Cuthites were not punished in their land when they served their gods, to send lions against them - and when they came to the land of God and did like their earlier actions, He sent  lions that would kill them them against them. And so did they learn in the Sifra (Kedoshim 11:14), "'and the land not vomit them out, etc.' - the land of Israel is not like other lands; it does not sustain worshippers of idols." And in the Sifrei (Haazinu 315), "'there [was] no foreign god with him' (Deuteronomy 32:12) - that there not be allowance for one of the ministers of the nations to come and rule over you, as the matter that is stated, 'and I go out, and behold the minister of Greece, etc.'" And this is [the meaning of] their statement (Ketuvot 110b), "Anyone that lives outside of the land is similar to one who does not have a God, as it is stated (Leviticus 25:38), 'to give to you the land of Canaan, to be be for you a God,' [...] and it states (I Samuel 26:19), 'for they have driven me away from attaching  myself to the inheritance of God saying, "let us worship other gods."'"  

Chapter 19



Verse 1



Verse 2


...One should be separate from sexual transgressions and all other transgressions, for any place that one find a fence or mention of sexual transgressions, one also finds a mention of the word "kadosh" or holiness. This is the language of Rashi. But in Sefer Vayikra, there is only a phrase of "You should be separate". And they learned there (Chapter 12:3), That the people should be holy because Hashem is holy and the people should be separate as Hashem is separate. According to my opinion, the separation is not from sins of sexual transgression, like the rabbi (Rashi) says. Rather, the separation should occur in any place that we are separate. The issue comes when the Torah warns of sexual transgressions and forbidden foods, the Torah also allows sexual relations between husband and wife and allows eating of meats and wines. Therefore, a desirous person will take advantage and have multiple wives or will be a savage when it comes to drinking wine and eating meat. He will do as he pleases because there is no prohibition in the Torah. However, he will be a scoundrel in the permissions of the Torah. Therefore, the torah comes to mention specifically after the prohibitions, the general rule or law that we should be separate from the permissible areas of the Torah.
