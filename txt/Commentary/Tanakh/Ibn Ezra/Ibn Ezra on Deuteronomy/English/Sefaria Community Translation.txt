The meaning is that you shall not offer [Korbanot] on the high places and mountains [referenced in the previous verse], rather, just in the place where He will place His name.

Verse 5


... This refers to the land, and the meaning is 'the place where His honor rests.'

Chapter 13



Chapter 14



Verse 1


"Nor make any baldness" - like the laws of the non-Jews up until this day.
And the reason is "[Ye are the] children": Since you know that your are children to God, and that he loves you more than the love of a father for his son; "ye shall not cut yourselves" over anything God does for you, since it is all for the good even if you don't understand - just as young children don't understand the actions of their parents yet still assent to them, so should you do; "for thou art a holy people" and you are not like the other nations, so don't do as they do.

Verse 19

I have already explained in Sefer HaYesod that it is possible to abbreviate words in any language e.g. donkey to donk'. Only the word "no" cannot be abbreviated because it will reverse the meaning. A great Spanish grammarian said [in this vein] that a "heh" is missing [here] and it should be "for is a man like a tree of the field" [as a rhetorical question.] (Note that a number of English translations actually render the phrase this way --Translator), but I do not find the notion compelling since what reason is there to say "Do not destroy a fruit tree for it is not like a person to who can run away from you" and according to my understanding we have no need for all this. [Rather] this is the explanation: "for you shall eat from it but not cut it down for a man is as a tree of the field" and similarly "for he seizes a soul" i.e. (in the case of seizing tools necessary for living as collateral, which is the verse cited --Translator) he is seizing things which preserve life. "and do not cut it down" [in our verse] is parsed along with "to go before you in a seige," that is to say "do not destroy a fruit tree, which provides life for people; it is only permitted for you to eat from it and not to cut it down to force the city into siege." Evidence that this is correct [comes from the phrase] "thou shalt cut it down and build a siege [tower]" [regarding non-fruit bearing trees]

"Thou shalt not see [thy brother’s] ox" - even when you are going out to war. (This is a homiletic interpretation.)

1. When you go out (to) camp. That is the camp (on) which one goes out against the enemy and the ark [of the covenant] is there; and it is a small camp and it is not a big camp - for partitions/screenings are done there; and when they go out to battle they are close around the ark [of the covenant]. And it is clear that one who is unclean of nocturnal pollution corrupts; and the  parashah is based on that on account of the war of Midian because it reminded the matter of Balaam, for they are bitter enemies on account of their kinswoman, and the ark [of the covenant] of the Lord was with the camp that went out to Midian. 
2. From anything bad. for the soul and for the body like the nocturnal pollution

That is written in this book of torah.  Because the essence of all of the commandments are there.  Even if the commandments need explanation from the [oral torah].  -- The commandments will not be observed until the heart is complete.  Therefore it says "with all your heart" because the commandments are kept in the heart.    

Verse 11

Esoteric. Hidden, or esoteric thing, wearisome to do.

Verse 12

It is not in heaven. To explain the meaning of esoteric.

Verse 13

Across the ocean.  To explain "far".  And it could be that this is the great ocean (likely Mediterranean or Atlantic), that a person cannot cross it because the water is too dark.

Verse 14

In your mouth and in your heart. The essence of all the commandments is in the heart. And there are some among them that require use of your mouth [and their purpose is] to strengthen the heart. And there are among them actions [so that we] talk [about the commandments] with our mouths.
