Verse 1


"The LORD is my light." Yirah is from something that is known, and pahad is from something unknown. When a person is fearful from revealed enemies who battle with him, that is called yirah. Corresponding to this it says...
That "The Lord is my light and my salvation, from whom shall I fear." This means as follows. It can be pictured that a person fears from his enemies, 1. lest they fall upon him in the night when he can not see them and protect himself from them. Corresponding to this it says "God is my light." 2. Lest their troops and their strength be greater than his troops and strength. Corresponding to this it says "God is my salvation" and so "from whom shall I fear." And when a person fears from his enemies who are plotting evil against him secretly to destroy  his tree and its fruit [based on Jeremiah 11:19] and he does not know, this is called pahad, and corresponding to this it says afterwards

"Mine are all the animals of the fields" - that are better than cows and ownerless. And if you think I desire the meat of a domesticated animal, I have
"The domesticated animas [behemot] on a thousand mountains", and also
"I know all the birds in the sky" and also



"If I were to hunger, would I tell you to sacrifice for thanksgiving?" Even if we were to picture that G-d gets hungry, would He need us to sacrifice for Him?
