Rashi on I Kings



Chapter 1



Verse 1

And it did not warm him- Our Rabbis said, "All who scorn clothing do not benefit from them in the end (Berakhot 62b 30-31)"- because he ripped of the corner of Saul's coat [he could not become warm through clothes]. And in the Midrash Agadah [it says]: Rav Shmuel the son of Nakhmani said, "When David saw the angel standing in Jerusalem with his sword in hand, his blood went cold from fear (See Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer 43)".

Solomon built up the Millo – Through this building he sealed up the breaches in the city of David because the breaches were behind the Millo. He (Yerovam) said to Shlomo ‘your father broke holes in the walls in order that those coming up for the festivals could come in, and you sealed them up in order to make a labor force for Pharoah’s daughter to settle her slaves and servants there.
