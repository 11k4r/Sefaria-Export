Verse 3

And his second was Kilav- And in a different place (Chronicles II, 3:1), it calls him Daniel, and so why was he called Kilav [here]? Rav Yitzchak said,
"It was on account of the scoffers of the generation, who said, 'Avigayil (Kilav's mom) was pregnant from Naval (her previous husband),' and so [G-d] changed his appearance and he resembled his father (David)." And our Rabbis said, "Because he embarassed Mephiboshet in law study (Berakhot 4a)"

to the Jebusites -  The fortress of Zion is called Jebus. Its inhabitants were of the descendants of Avimelech and they had two statues - one blind and the other lame. They were made to represent Yitzchak and Yaakov and in their mouths was the oath that Avraham had sworn to Avimelech, therefore they (Israel) did not drive them out. When they took Jerusalem they failed to take the stronghold, as it is stated: “And the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the people of Judah were unable…” (Yehoshua 15:63) and it was taught: R’ Yehoshua ben Levi said: They were able, but they were not permitted.
