Halacha 1

<b>Just as a person is commanded...and afterward he returns the lost object of his teacher.:</b> In [Bava] Metzia 43a, at the end of the 2nd chapter - It was taught: His father's lost object and his teacher's lost object - his teacher's takes precedence, since his father brings him to life in this world, but his teacher who taught him wisdom brings him to life in the world to come. And if his father is equal to his teacher [in wisdom] - his father's takes precedence.  His father and his teacher were [each] carrying a burden - he lays down his teacher's, and afterward lays down his father's. His father and his teacher were in captivity - he redeems his teacher, and afterward redeems his father.  But if his father is a Sage - he redeems his father, and afterward redeems his teacher. (Bava Metzia 43a)  And the words of our Teacher (Rashi) who wrote here that: if his father is a Sage, even though he is not equal [in wisdom] to his teacher, he returns his [father's] lost object, and afterward returns his teacher's.  It is surprising that this was taught explicitly in our Mishnah that if his father was equal [in wisdom] to his teacher, his father's [lost object] takes precedence.  Therefore clearly if he is not equal, his teacher's takes precedence.  Yet our Teacher himself wrote in Chapter 12 of the Laws of Robbery and Lost Property, "If he chanced upon [both] the lost object of his teacher and the lost object of his father - if his father was equal to his teacher [in wisdom], his father's takes precedence, but if not his teacher's takes precedence.  And this is characteristic of his teacher, that he learned the majority of his Torah wisdom from him."
