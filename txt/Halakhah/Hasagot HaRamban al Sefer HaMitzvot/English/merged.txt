Hasagot HaRamban al Sefer HaMitzvot

Introduction



I come with my wish to learn from those who have come before, to confirm their rules, and to wear them as adorning jewels; but I shall not be a dumb mule and carry their books like a fool. I shall explicate their methods and assess their worth. But if my thoughts cannot abide them, I shall humbly take issue with them, and judge as my eyes are given to see, with the clear legal vision given to me. I shall not show favoritism to received teaching. For God grants wisdom in all ages and days, and withholds not grace from those who walk in God's ways.

We should be careful to not feel pained by giving tzedaka to the poor, nor should we give stingily, nor think of it as below us. Rather this should be in our eyes a merit, a benefit and an addition to his income, since God, Blessed be He, will compensate us in multiple ways......
