Kitzur Shulkhan Aruch Yalkut Yosef



Section 1



Siman 1

We learned in Masechet Avot, Yehuda son of Tema says, (Pirkei Avot 5:20) "Be bold like a leopard, light like an eagle, run like a deer, and strong like a lion to do the will of your Father in Heaven." And they learned from here four rules in serving Hashem "be bold like a leopard" when someone does a Commandment (Mitzvah) they shouldn't be embarrassed from those who mock him. "And light like an eagel" to quickly close his eyes from seeing bad things because the watching of eyes are the start of the sin. "And run like a deer" That the feet should run to do good things. "And strong like a lion" this is a overpowering over the human will. And therefore one should power-up like a lion to stand in the morning to serve Hashem, like you awaken the dawn. No matter what one shouldn't be late to the time of of prayers or the time of saying SHEMA ISRAEL. [The main strengthening  should be in the heart to, to overcome his will to win it, like a powerful man overpowers his hater and wins him and drops him to the earth. This is how one should fight is evil inclination, like a lion, get up from his sleep to server hashem ]. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 57). And never the less, that one who does a mitzvah, he should not be embarrassed from those who make fun of him, and anyway don't quarrel with them and fight the them, in order that he wouldn't get used to the trait of boldness which is very improper. And if his aim is to influence the eyes of the community in the matter of Torah or Mitzvot, and he tried already the way of peace but wasn't successful, then he is allowed to bolden himself to fight with them to defeat their wrong thoughts.

...
A person should wake up early enough in the morning so he can prepare himself to pray in cleanliness (bathroom, mikveh, etc), so he shouldn't miss out on praying on the right time. There's a custom in a some Jewish congregations, that the assistant of the congregation goes in the morning and knocks on doors and windows to wake up people for prayers and services of g-d.
A person shouldn't think the more sleeping he has is better for one's body, doctors have already agreed that a person shouldn't sleep less than 6 hours and no more than 8. Furthermore, it could be harmful for your health. And they said in the Gemara: When the righteous sleep, it's bad for them and bad for the world. The Torah that they toil in protects the generation, when they're not learning calamity comes to the world. Additionally in the Gemara it says that scholars that toil in Torah during the night, the Torah considered it as if they're involved in the sacrificial services. They also said, in the Jerusalem Talmud someone who is working the Torah in modesty (at night where nobody can see him) he does not forget his learning quickly. And Maimonides wrote: Even though it's a mitzvah to learn night and day, a person learns most of his wisdom at night. Therefore, if someone wants to merit the crown of Torah, he should be careful every single night, not to waste is on sleeping, eating and idle chatter, rather it should be with Torah and words of wisdom.

Siman 2

It is worthy and good for every G-d fearer to be troubled and worried by the destruction of the Bet Hamikdash and the exile of the Shekhinah, as it says, "Get up and sing in the night, at the beginning of the watches." And just like the Holy One, Blessed be He laments at that time, and says, "Woe to me that I destroyed my house..." like this for everyone who G-d touched his heart to lament in the middle of the night about the destruction, and on the spreading of Israel through the nations, and the exile of the Torah, and the killing of the righteous. And everybody who is able to wake up in the middle of the night, he should do it and say "Tikkun Hasot". And also, if you remain awake until the middle of the night, try not to sleep until you say Tikkun Hasot, to join with the pain of the Shekhinah in exile. However, when you pray and learn Torah you should be happy. And in any case, if you cry during the prayer, you prayer is accepted more.

Siman 3

One should be careful to be modest when he dresses or undresses, and one shouldn't say "Behold I am in hidden rooms 'who can see me?' because Hashem's presence fills the entire universe. A person who usually dresses modest should be careful not to reveal [skin] out of respect for Hashem. When one arises he should be very swift to dress himself. A child who understands things should be taught from a young age to dress himself modestly. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 207).

synagogues and houses of learning are called "a minor sanctuary (mikdash)"as it says and I will be for them a minor sanctuary- these are synagogues and houses of learning. And they have holiness.  And so it is important to be very careful in their honor, and to clean them well.  And one should sit in them in fear and awe, and light within them a ner tamid for honor....

The entire congregation is required to recite the haftarah quietly together with the one leading the congregation. [Yalkut Yosef, Shabbat A, pg 352].


On a shabbat when a double-portion is read, the haftara of the second portion is recited, as that is the portion that concludes the [Torah] reading.




Siman 281

Even though a person listens to the entire Torah reading every Shabbat from the leader of the congregation, he must read it to himself, the verses twice and a translation once. And anyone who completes his [weekly] Torah portion [study] with the congregation [is blessed with] lengthy days and years. And also, one who is engrossed in the study of Torah the entire day, and his Torah study is his profession, may not withdraw from reading the weekly Torah portion with the congregation. He must read the portion, the verses twice and the translation once. And if one is engrossed in Torah to the point that involves the recording of insights and rulings, he is permitted to read on Friday night, the verses twice and the translation once. [Yalkut Yosef, Shabbat Vol.1 pg 354].

Saving a live suspends [the laws of] Shabbat, as it suspends all mitzvot.  As is stated in Lev 18:5 "and you will observe all my statutes and laws so that a person will do them and live through them.  In Yoma 85b, the Sages state, "and live by them and not die by them".  Thus it is a mitzvah and obligation for any Jew to desecrate the Sabbath for any person who is dangerously ill.  The Sages stated in Yerushalmi Yoma 41b, be quick to desecrate Shabbat in order to save a life, even [violating] those labors (melakhot) mentioned in the Torah is praiseworthy.  Questioning is condemned and the one who questions is as one who sheds blood.  And further the Sages say, Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 37a, all who save [even] one (Jewish) soul is as if sustaining an entire world.

It is our custom to arise in the early hours of the morning to recite "selichot" (penitential prayers), commencing from the day of Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur, for we have the tradition in our hands that Moshe Rabeinu a'h ascended to bring down the second set of tablets on Rosh Chodesh Elul and descended with the tablets on Yom Kippur, and all these forty days are days of mercy for all of Israel. On Yom Kippur God forgave Israel with joy and said to Moshe "I have forgiven your word", so therefore Yom Kippur was established as a day of forgiveness, penitence and atonement. And on the days of Rosh Chodesh themselves our custom is not to say Selichot. 
The most fitting time to say Selichot on these days is from midnight onwards for that is a time of favour, for in the first half of the night it is forbidden to say Selichot and the 13 attributes of God's mercy. If a person finds himself in a synagogue where it is customary to say Selichot in the first half of the night it is not permitted to join with then but rather sit alone and remain silent, and not respond to their 13 attributes of mercy. And on the contrary it is best of annul this custom as it has no foundation. The time for midnight has should be calculated in such a way as to calculate the beginning of the hours between sunrise and sunset, half of that is midday, when the sun is in the middle of the sky, and add 12 hours to midday and that gives you midnight exactly.
For those living abroad it is best that they wait to say Selichot at their time, even if it is already midnight in Israel. Nevertheless, there is a leniency to say Selichot together with the residents of Israel,... they have on whom to rely halachically and they are permitted to say Selichot with the people of Israel.
A congregation that is unable to get up for Selichot when it is still night is able to say Selichot in the ealry hours of the morning, before Shacharit, or before Mincha after midday  [until the stars emerge]. It is best if the Chazzan says Selichot wrapped in tzitzit, from what Chazal say in Rosh Hashanah, "God passed over his face, Rabbi Yochanan said, had the verse not said thise it would not be possible to say this, it teaches that God wrapped himself as a shaliach tzibbur and showed Moshe the order of prayer and said to him, when Israel sin do according to this order and I will forgive them. Rabbi Yehuda said a covenant was made with the 13 attributes of mercy that they would never return empty handed, as it says "Behold, I make a covenant". Similarly in the army camps where it is not possible to say Selichot in the early hours they say Selichot before Shacharit or before Mincha or after midnight.
Even though one doesn't say the 13 attributes of mercy during the hours before midnight, it is permitted to hear the 13 attributes on the radio in order to learn and to be accustomed to the tunes of the supplications and similar. An allusion is what is said in Rosh Hashana (24b) "Don't learn to do but you can learn to understand and to teach"
One who hears Selichot and the 13 attributes or kaddish from the shaliach tzibbur through the radio broadcast after midnight should reply with the 13 attributes and say amen. If the broadcast is a recording one should not respond. But one who hears the reading of the megillah through the radio has not fulfilled his obligation.
Avreichim, those in Yeshiva and Talmidei Chachamim who are unable to get up early every day through Elul to say Selichot for they sit and learn Torah late at night, and if they get up to say Selichot it will affect their learning should try to get up for some of the nights of Elul to join the community in saying Selichot and supplications. Or on Mondays and Thursdays in Elul, and then join together with the community to say Selichot during the ten days of atonement between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
This is the rule for teachers of children who, if they get up to Selichot won't be able to do their work faithfully teaching their students, they are permitted to not get up everyday in Elul. Rather they should get up when they can at times throughout Elul and then during the ten days of atonement to say Selichot with the community. This is the law for officers and employed workers who, if they get up for Selichot won't be able to do their work faithfully, they are permitted to not get up every day, rather periodically and during the ten days of atonement. Or they can say it in the morning before Shacharit, or in the evening before Mincha, and as we explained above.
Talmidei Chachamim and those in Yeshiva who don't get up every day for Selichot, if they go to sleep after midnight, it is good for them to say some Selichot before they sleep even alone, and should also say Tikkun Chatzot before they sleep. Saying Tikkun Chatzot is more important than the recitation of Selichot with the community.
One who gets up in the early hours to say Selichot during Elul and the ten days of atonement, should be strong not to sleep during keriat shema and it's blessings and the silent amida until it's completion. All the more so when one is wrapped in tefillin it is prohibited to take ones mind of them and one has to guard oneself in holiness and purity. One who does not do so, and he sleeps during prayer with his tefillin, or sleeps during prayer and keriat shema his reward is lost. It is best when one prays fittingly when he says selichot upon arising in service of God, to guard the fundamentals and add on with piousness and not to debase the fundamentals and fulfill the extras.

Any person who has a conflict with his fellow, should not permit himself to confidently maintain the justness of his position, because "one does not see his own wrong" (Shabbat 119a). Rather, he should put forth his claims with truth and simplicity before an established Rabbi, asking him to rule whether or not he is obligated to return money to his fellow. And even if his fellow is not bringing him to court, he is still obligated to fulfill his obligation towards heaven by asking a Torah scholar who is an expert decision-maker, as it is written (Mishna Avot Ch.1) "Make for yourself a Rabbi and avoid doubt". And even if his fellow does not know of the theft that was taken from him, one still has to return what was stolen and appease him. [Yalkut Yosef Moadim pg. 78. Chazon Ovadia on High Holidays pg.240]
