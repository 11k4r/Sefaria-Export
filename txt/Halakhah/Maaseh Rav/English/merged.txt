Maaseh Rav

Siman 1

To arise at midnight and recite Tikkun Chatzot.

Siman 2

One who is awake the whole night, washes his hands and blesses [the morning blessings], but not the blessings on the Torah.  If he then sleeps by day, he must say the blessings on the Torah [upon arising].


Siman 3



Siman 4

In washing one's hands, both in the morning and for a meal, the right hand should be first.


Siman 5

In the morning, one should pour 4 times.  Three times to remove evil spirits, and a fourth time to purify the water which became impure.

Siman 6

The blessing Elokai Neshama (My G-d, the soul you placed in me) should be said together with the blessing Asher Yatzar (Who formed man with wisdom).  [See Biurei haGra Shulchan Orach Orach Chaim 4:3]
