Mishneh Torah, Divorce



Chapter 1

[1] A woman may be divorced only by means of a writ that reaches her, and this writ is called a get. According to the Torah, there are ten rules that are basic to divorce, and they are as follows: that the man may not divorce his wife except of his own free will; that he must give a divorce by means of a writ, and not by means of anything else... that it must be written specifically for her... that he must deliver it to her; that he must deliver it to her in the presence of witnesses; that he must give it to her as an instrument of divorce; that it must be the husband, or his agent, who gives it to her...
•	[2] And from where to we know that these ten rules are derived from the Torah? From this verse (Deuteronomy 24:1) "[If] she fails to please him, because he finds something unseemly about her, he writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house."
•	"[If] she fails to please him" implies that he may not give a divorce except of his own free will. If she is divorced against his will, she is not divorced. However a woman may be divorced with her consent as well as without it.
