Mishneh Torah, Eruvin



Chapter 1

According to biblical law, if a courtyard has many tenants, each living in a house of his own, they may all move objects throughout the courtyard as well as from the houses into the courtyard and from the courtyard into the houses, because the entire courtyard is a single private domain, so that it is permissible to move objects through the whole of it. The same rule applies to an alley that has courtyards opening into it on three sides and the fourth side opening into the public road. By fastening at this fourth side a stake in the ground or a cross-beam above, the alley and the courts opening into it become a single private domain, so that all the residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects throughout the alley as well as from the courtyards into the alley and from the alley into the courtyards.— —
By rabbinical enactment, however, it is forbidden to transfer objects within a private domain where there is a separation of tenants, each living in a separate house, unless they create a symbolical fusion of all the tenants by preparing an <i>eruv</i> on Friday. It is all the same whether it is a courtyard, an alley or a town. This regulation was originated by Solomon and his legislative body.



What is the form of the prescribed <i>eruv?</i> It consists of a quantity of food contributed by the residents jointly and deposited on Friday, as if to say: "We are all one fellowship, we all have the same food, and none of us keeps a domain distinct from that of his neighbor; just as we share equally the area of the <i>eruv</i>, so we have equal rights in each of the areas held by each individually; all of us are a single domain." This symbolical act serves to prevent people from falling into error and imagining that it is permissible to move objects from a private domain to a public domain.
The <i>eruv</i> prepared by the tenants of a courtyard is called <i>courtyard eruv;</i> the one prepared by the inhabitants of an alley or by all the residents of a town is called <i>cooperative eruv</i>.








How is a <i>courtyard eruv</i> prepared? A whole loaf of bread is collected from each house, and all the loaves are placed within a single container and deposited in one of the dwellings of the courtyard.— — When gathering and depositing the food contributed by the various tenants, one should recite this benediction: "Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the precept of <i>eruv</i>." He should then add: "By virtue of this <i>eruv</i>, all the residents of this courtyard will be permitted to transfer objects from house to house on the Sabbath."— —
How should an <i>alley eruv</i> be prepared? One collects the smallest quantity of food, the size of a dry fig, from each resident, or even less than that if there are many residents, and puts it all into a single container; he then deposits it in one of the courtyards of the alley or in one of the houses, — — saying: "By virtue of this <i>cooperative eruv</i>, all residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects between the courtyards and the alley on the Sabbath."

Chapter 6
























Just as a blessing should be recited when either a courtyard <i>eruv</i> or an alley <i>eruv</i> is prepared, so should a blessing be recited over an <i>eruv</i> prepared between Sabbath limits. One should also add: "By virtue of this <i>eruv</i>, I shall be permitted to walk two thousand cubits in any direction from this place." — —

Chapter 7

If a person goes out of town on Friday, stops at a certain spot within or at the end of the town's Sabbath limit, and says: "Let my Sabbath resting-place be here," and then returns and spends the night in town, he is permitted to walk the next day two thousand cubits in any direction from that spot. The principle underlying the <i>eruv</i> for Sabbath limits is that of actually walking to the spot of the <i>eruv</i>. The sages, however, declared that even if one does not go out of town and does not stop at a certain spot, he may prepare the <i>eruv</i> by placing food for two meals at the site through a messenger, thus making things easier for the wealthy person who does not have to go himself, but may send his <i>eruv</i> by someone else to deposit it for him.

Chapter 8




The same as it is forbidden to go beyond the Sabbath limits on the Sabbath, so it is forbidden to go beyond these limits on a holyday and on <i>Yom Kippur</i>, — — but on a holyday it is permissible to transfer objects from one domain to another. Accordingly, we must lay an <i>eruv</i> for courts and form a <i>cooperative eruv</i> for alleys for <i>Yom Kippur</i> as well as for the Sabbath, and we must prepare an <i>eruv</i> for Sabbath limits for <i>Yom Kippur</i> and for holydays just as it is required for the Sabbath.
If a holyday occurs on the day before or after the Sabbath, or in the Diaspora where two days are observed instead of the one, a person may deposit two <i>eruv</i> symbols in two different directions, relying on whichever of the two he pleases on the first day, and upon the second <i>eruv</i> on the second day.— — This applies only to the two Diaspora holydays. The two days of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, however, are considered as a single day, and only one <i>eruv</i> symbol in one direction is sufficient for both days.


One who makes an eiruv techumin (the placing of food in a location to extend the area to which one is permitted to walk on the Sabbath, a holiday, or the Day of Atonement) for a two-day holiday in the Diaspora or for the Sabbath and [an adjacent] holiday, although it is one eiruv in one direction for both days, the eiruv-food must be in its place on the first night and the second night for the entire period between sundown and nightfall. What does he do? He brings the eiruv-food on the eve of the holiday or of the Sabbath and waits with it until dark and takes it with him if it is the night of a holiday (on which carrying is permitted in certain circumstances). The next day, he takes it to the same place and leaves it there until nightfall and eats it if it is the Sabbath or takes it with him if it is a holiday. This is because the Sabbath and the holiday are two [separate] periods of holiness and are not considered to be one day; therefore, we are not able to say that the eiruv works from the first day for both days.
If the eiruv-food was eaten on the first day, the eiruv was acquired for the first day, and there is no eiruv for the second day. If he made the eiruv with his feet on the first day, he must make it with his feet on the second day, this being walking to the place and standing there, thinking that he should acquire a place of rest there [such that the place where he is standing will be considered his place so he can walk 2000 cubits in any direction from that place]. If he made the eiruv with bread on the first day, and he makes it with his feet the second day, it is an acceptable eiruv. If he wants to make the eiruv with bread [the second day], he must use the same bread that he used for the eiruv the first day.
If the Day of Atonement falls on the evening of the Sabbath or the night following the Sabbath during the time that the months were decided on the basis of people witnessing the new moon, it seems to me that they are considered to be one day and one period of holiness.
This that we said that he can make two eiruvs in two directions for two days [of a holiday] is only if he is able to get to each of the two eiruv-foods on the first day. But if he is unable to get to the eiruv-food for the second day on the first day, the second eiruv is not an eiruv. [This is] because the commandment of the eiruv-food is that it should be able to be eaten as a meal while it is still [the] day [i.e. not the night, of the Sabbath or holiday], and in this case, because he can not get to the second eiruv-food on the first day, it is not fit for eating while it is still day.
How so? If he left the eiruv-food 2000 cubits to the east of his house and designated it for the first day and left another eiruv-food 1, 100, or 1000 cubits west [of his house], this second eiruv is not an eiruv. For behold, on the first day, the second eiruv-food was not fitting for him while it was still day because he was not able to get to it because he could not walk to the west of his house at all [because the eiruv-food of the first day established his rest place 2000 cubits east of his house so the farthest west he could have walked was his house].
But if he left his eiruv-food 1500 cubits east of his house and designated it for the first day and left a second eiruv-food no more than 500 cubits west of his house and designated it for the second day, it is an eiruv. [This is] because he is able to get to it on the first day.
If a holyday occurs on Friday, one must not prepare an <i>eruv</i> for courtyards nor for Sabbath limits on that day, but must do so on Thursday which is the day preceding the festival. If the two Diaspora holydays occur on Thursday and Friday, the <i>eruv</i> for Sabbath limits and the <i>eruv</i> for courtyards should be deposited on Wednesday.— —
How does he stipulate a condition? He says on Thursday, 'If today is the holiday, my words [making an eiruv] lack substance and if it is not [a holiday], this is an eiruv.' The next day, he makes an eiruv again and says, 'If today is the holiday, I already made an eiruv yesterday, and my words lack substance, and if yesterday was the holiday, it is an eiruv.' When does this apply? On the two days of a holiday in the Diaspora, but the two days of the New Year are considered as one day, and he may make an eiruv only on the eve of the holiday.
