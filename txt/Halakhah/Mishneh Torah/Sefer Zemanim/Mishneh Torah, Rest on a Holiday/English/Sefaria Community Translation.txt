Mishneh Torah, Rest on a Holiday



Chapter 1

These six days on which scripture prohibited labor, namely the first and seventh days of Passover, the first and eighth days of Succot, the day of Shavuot, and first day of the seventh month (Rosh HaShanah), are called Holidays (<i>Yamim Tovim</i>). The degree of cessation of labor is equal in all of them, in that all labor is prohibited, excepting the one category of labor necessary for preparing food, as stated (Exodus 12:16): "Except anything that shall be eaten by any person" 


Any creative labor regarding which one is liable for on the Sabbath, if one did it on a Holiday where it was not for a need of eating, one is lashed, except for bringing [something] out from domain to domain, and starting a fire, in that since bringing out was permitted on a Holiday for a need of eating, it was permitted when not for a need of eating. Therefore it is permitted on a Holiday to bring out a child or scroll of the Torah or a key, and similar cases to these from domain to domain. And similarly it is permitted to start a fire even though it is not for a need of eating. And the rest of the creative labors, all for which there is a need of eating regarding them, it is permitted, for example slaughtering, baking and kneading, and similar cases. And all for which  there is no need for eating regarding them, it is forbidden, for example, writing, and weaving, and building, and similar cases.
Every labor that can be done on the eve of the holiday where it will not result in spoliation or loss if it is done on the eve of the holiday is prohibited by the rabbis to be done on the holiday itself, even though it is for the purposes of eating. And why did they prohibit this? It is a protective decree lest an individual leave the labors s/he could have done on the holiday eve for the holiday itself and find that his/her holiday is spent entirely on doing those very labors, and thus prevent the enjoyment of the holiday and leave no free time to eat. 
And for this reason itself they did not forbid the bringing out on a Holiday, even though every bringing out is a creative labor. , in that it is possible to do it from the eve of a Holiday. And why did they not forbid it? In order to increase the joy of the Holiday. and one may go and come as much as one wants, and will fulfill one's desires, and will not be like one whose hands are tied. But the rest of the creative labors that are possible to do o the eve of the Holiday, since regarding them there is [the possibility of] occupation [with them], we do not do them on a Holiday.














That which we do outside the Land, every one of these [Holidays being observed for] two days, it is a custom. And the second day of the Holiday is from the words of the Sages, and are among the things that were invented in the exile. And the residents of the land of Israel do not do two days of the Holiday except on Rosh Hashana alone. And in the Laws of the Sanctification of the New Moon in this book, we will make clear the principle of this practice, and for what reason we do Rosh Hashana for two days in every place.
The second day of a Holiday, even though it is from the words of the Sages, every thing that is forbidden on the first is forbidden on the second. And anyone who desecrates the second day of a Holiday, even if it Rosh Hashana, whether in a matter that was because of <i>shevut</i> [Rabbinically ordained resting] or creative labor or he went outside the limit, we lash with lashes of rebellion or ostracize him if he is not among the students [of Torah]. And just as on the first [day] it is forbidden regarding eulogies and fasting and one is obligated in joy, so too on the second. And there is no difference between them except only for the matter of one who dies .
How so? The one who dies on the first Holiday [day], non-Jews a non-Jew attends to his burial. But on the second [day] of a Holiday, Israel attends to it. And they perform all its requirements, for example making the bier, sewing shrouds, picking spices, and everything similar to this, in that the second [day] of a Holiday with regard to someone who died is considered like an ordinary day, and even on the second days of Rosh Hashana. 
These two festival days of the diaspora are two instances of holiness, and they are not like one day. Therefore, something that was <i>muktzeh</i> (set aside from use) on the first festival day, or that was born on the first, if he prepared it for the second, it is permitted. How so? An egg  that was laid on the first can be eaten on the second. A wild animal and a bird t hat were trapped on the first can be eaten on the second. Something connected to the ground that was uprooted on the first can be eaten on the second. And similarly, it is permitted to blue an eye on the second festival day, even though there is no sickness there. These words apply to the two festival days of the diaspora, bit the two days of New Year are one instance of holiness, and are considered like one day for all of these things, except only for the matter of the deceased. But, an egg that was laid on the first day of New Year is forbidden on the second, and similarly for all similar cases. If Sabbath was adjacent to a festival day, and an egg was laid on one of them, it is forbidden on the other, and similarly for all similar cases. And even if it was laid on the second day, it is not eaten on the Sabbath which is adjacent to it.

Chapter 2

A chick that was hatched on Yom Tov is prohibited [to eat on the Yom Tov it was born] because it is Muktzeh. A calf that was born on Yom Tov- If it's mother was going to be used for meat- it is permitted [to slaughter the calf and eat it on Yom Tov] because the animal is considered to be prepared [for Yom Tov] because of its mother's [status] and if one were to slaughter it's mother while it was still inside- it is permitted to eat [the fetus inside] even though it was not born.
Animals that go out and graze outside of the Techum and come to sleep within the Techum- these are considered to be prepared and [it is permitted] to take them and slaughter them on Yom Tov. But those [animals] that graze and sleep outside of the Techum- if they come [within the Techum] on Yom Tov- They are prohibited to be slaughtered on Yom Tov because they are Muktzeh and they are not on the minds of the people of the city [to be considered to be eaten on Yom Tov]. 
And similarly Kadshim animals that received a blemish on Yom Tov [is prohibited to slaughter and eat on Yom Tov] since [the owner] did not have his mind on it [to be slaughtered for personal use on Yom Tov] from the eve of Yom Tov- it is prohibited to slaughter it on Yom Tov. Therefore it is prohibited for one to examine blemishes on Kadshim animals on Yom Tov because it is a [rabbinic] decree lest a sage permit [Kadshim animals] with blemishes [to be slaughtered for personal use] and he [the owner] will come to slaughter it on that day [on Yom Tov]. But [the sage] may look at the blemish on the eve of Yom Tov and for the next day [tell the owner if it is] permitted or prohibited.
A Bechor that was born [on Yom Tov] with a blemish- it is considered to be prepared [for Yom Tov] and it should not be examined on Yom Tov. If one were to transgress and see the blemish, examine it and permit it [to be eaten]- it can be slaughtered and eaten [on Yom Tov]. A Bechor that falls into a pit- make for it provisions [so that it will not die] because one is not able to bring it up because it it not considered to be fit for slaughter on Yom Tov. [If] it and it's child were to fall into a pit- He should bring up the animal on condition to slaughter it and not do so and be cunning and bring up the second one on [the same] condition to slaughter and slaughter either one he wishes. Because of animal suffering it is permitted to use cunning. Hullin animals that fall from a roof and stood there from time to time- it requires examination[to determine if the animal is valid for consumption]. It may be slaughtered  and may be examined. It is possible that it would be found to be suitable and may be eaten.
 
[If] one sets aside black [birds] and sets aside white [birds] and finds the white ones in the place of the black ones- [They are] prohibited [on Yom Tov] because I [the Rambam] say- maybe those that were set aside [for Yom Tov] flew away and these are others and everything that has a doubt for being prepared [for Yom Tov] is prohibited [to be slaughtered/eaten] on Yom Tov. [If] one were to set aside two [birds] and finds three- all [the birds] are prohibited. [If] one were to set aside three and find two- they are permitted. [If] he were to set them aside within the coop and find them in front of the coop and there and they [the birds] are the only ones and are unable to fly eve though there is another coop there on the corner within fifty cubits-these [birds] are permitted because they only hop around by their coop in the vicinity.
Fish that are in large Bribbin, and similarly domesticated animals and fowl that are in large Bribbin, anything that is  lacking trapping to the point that [the owners] say "Come from the trap and we will trap it"- these [Animals in these traps] are Muktzeh and one cannot trap them on Yom Tov and if one were to trap [these animals in these large Bribbin]- it may not be eaten. Anything that does not require trapping is considered to be prepared and may be trapped on Yom Tov and eaten. Similarly and domesticated animal that is cooped up in an area near a city and gives birth to young- while they [the young] are still little and do not require to be trapped [to slaughter them]- [also] do not required to be set aside [for Yom Tov] because he had his mind on them [to be used for Yom Tov]
Traps for wild animals, birds and fish that are baited from the eve of Yom Tov- one should only take that which [was trapped] inside them if he knows that they were trapped before Yom Tov. One who dams a canal on the eve of Yom Tov and finds in it the next day [On Yom Tov] fish- they are permitted to be eaten on Yom Tov for they were already trapped on the eve of Yom Tov and are considered to be prepared.
  A [store]house that is filled with fruits are [considered to be] prepared [for Yom Tov] and one may open it and take [the fruits inside] from the opening. One who stands on Muktzeh from the eve of Yom Tov [before Yom Tov] during the Shmittah year when all fruits are considered to be owner-less require specification [to acquire them since they are owner-less (even though the fruits are in his field because it is Shmittah)] and he should say "from here until here I will take" and if he does not specify he cannot take.

Chapter 3



Chapter 4

We do not bring out [i.e. kindle] fire - not from wood and not from stone and not from metal, for example by rubbing them one against the other or striking this one on that one until fire comes out. And similarly, the particular oil [i.e. fuel] that is in water that we shake until it ignites. Or a clear and hard glass utensil filled with water that we place opposite the appearance of the sun until it focuses its shine onto flax or something similar to it and ignites. All of this and similar to it is forbidden on a Holiday, in that they did not permit burning on a Holiday other than from fire which is [already] found [to exist]. But the one to brings out [new] fire is forbidden in that behold it is possible to bring it out while it is still evening.
Despite that burning is permitted on a Holiday, that which is not for a need, it is forbidden to extinguish the fire, even if it is burning for a need of eating, in that extinguishing is a creative labor which is not for the need of eating generally. And just as we do not extinguish the fire, so too we do not extinguish the lamp. And if one extinguished, one is lashed just like one who weaved or built. 

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

When a holy day (chag) falls on a Thursday night/Friday, we don't cook on the chag for the next day even if it is Shabbat.  This is a rabbinic prohibition in order that [we don't transgress the even more serious Torah prohibition] and cook on chag for a weekday.  All the more so we don't cook on Shabbat for a weekday!  Therefore, [in order to make it possible to cook on a chag for the next day when it is Shabbat, the rabbis instituted the following permission if] we make a dish for Shabbat prior to the beginning of the chag which precedes it, then one may cook [the other dishes] on chag for Shabbat. And the dish that was made [prior to chag for Shabbat which allowed for the cooking to take place] is called "eruvei tavshilin."
And why is it called an "<i>eruv</i>"? It is just like the name that is the "<i>eruv</i>" that we make in courtyards and alleys from the eve of the Sabbath because it is a sign in order that one will not get it into one's head that it is permitted to go out from domain to domain on the Sabbath. Similarly is this cooked dish, because it is a sign and reminder in order that one not consider and think that it is permitted to bake on the Holiday what is not to be eaten on that day. And therefore, this cooked dish was called "<i>eruvei tavshilin</i>".





The one who puts an <i>eruv tavshilin</i> into place is obligated to bless: "Blessed are You LORD our God  King of the Universe who made us holy with His commandments and commanded us regarding the commandment of <i>eruv</i>". And one says "with this <i>eruv</i> it is permitted for me to bake and cook from a Holiday to the next day - for the Sabbath. And if one is granting it for others, one says, "for me and for so-and-so and for so-and-so or for all the people of the city together, to bake and to cook from the Holiday to the Sabbath.


Two Holiday days that fell to be on Thursday and the eve of the Sabbath - one makes <i>eruvei tavshilin</i> starting on the Wednesday that precedes the Holiday. If one forgot and did not place one's placement on the first day, one makes a condition. How? One places <i>eruvei tavshilin</i> on Thursday and says, "if today is the Holiday and tomorrow is ordinary, then tomorrow I will cook and bake for the Sabbath and I have no need  at all  [for an <i>eruv tavshilin</i>], and if today is ordinary and tomorrow is the Holiday, with this <i>eruv</i> it is permitted to me to bake and to cook tomorrow on the Holiday for the Sabbath.




In the same way that there is an obligation to honor the Sabbath and to delight in it those obligations apply to the festivals. As it is stated (Isaiah 58:13) "to the Holy God who is honored" and all of the holidays are referred to as (Leviticus 23:7) "a time of holiness". We have already addressed the ideas of honor and delight in the laws of the Sabbath. It is therefore fitting for a person to refrain from feasting on the eve of festivals from the time of minha just as we do on Sabbath eve as this is part of obligation of honoring. And, anyone who disgraces the festivals, it is as if he as served foreign worship.
It is forbidden to fast or give eulogies on the seven days of Pesach and the eight days of Sukkot, along with all other [major and minor] holidays. A man is obligated to be (especially) happy and in good spirits on these days and to make sure that his wife, children, and entire household are happy as well as it says "and you shall be happy on your festivals etc." Even though the "happiness" referred to is a sacrifice, as we explained in the Laws of the Pilgrimage Offering, it includes the obligation to make each member of one's household happy in an appropriate manner.
How [does one make everyone happy appropriately]? Give the children nuts and candy, and buy the women as much nice clothing and jewelry as he can afford. And the men eat meat and drink wine since there is no happiness without meat and wine. And when [the head of household] eats and drinks, he is obligated to feed strangers, orphans and widows as well as all other poor people. However, if he locks his doors and eats and drinks with his family and does not feed the poor and others going through hard times, this is not the joy which was commanded, but [merely] satisfying his stomach. About such people, it is said "Their sacrifices are like the bread of mourners, all who eat it will be contaminated for their bread is for their own appetites." Such parties are disgraceful to those who participate in them as it says "I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your festival [sacrificial meals]"
Even though feasting and making merry are biblical commandments, one should not eat and drink all day, rather follow this procedure: Go to the synagogue in the morning, pray and read the appropriate Torah portion. Then they go home, eat, return to the synagogue, and study Torah until it is time for the Mincha service. Then they pray, go home, and feast for the rest of the day until nightfall.
When a person eats, drinks, and rejoices on the pilgrimage festival, he should not overdo it with wine, merriment, and light-headedness, saying that anyone who increases this increases in fulfilling the commandment to rejoice. For drunkenness, abounding merry-making, and light-headedness aren't rejoicing, but rather debauchery and foolishness, and we are not commanded regarding debauchery and foolishness, but regarding rejoicing that contains the service of the Creator of all, as it says (Deuteronomy 28:47), "because thou didst not serve the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things." Thus, you learn that service is with joy. And it is impossible to serve God through merry-making, light-headedness, or drunkenness.
When a person eats, drinks, and celebrates on a festival, he should not let himself become overly drawn to drinking wine, mirth, and levity, saying, "whoever indulges in these activities more is increasing [his observance of] the mitzvah of rejoicing." For drunkenness, profuse mirth, and levity are not rejoicing; they are frivolity and foolishness.  And we were not commanded to indulge in frivolity or foolishness, but rather in rejoicing that involves the service of the Creator of all existence. As it is said, "Because you did not serve God, Your Lord, with happiness and a glad heart with an abundance of prosperity." (Deut. 28:47) This teaches us that service [of God] involves joy. And it is impossible to serve God while in the midst of levity, frivolity, or drunkenness.
