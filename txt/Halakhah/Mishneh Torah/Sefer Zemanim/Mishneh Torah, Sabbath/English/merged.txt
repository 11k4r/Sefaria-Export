Mishneh Torah, Sabbath



Chapter 1

To rest on the seventh day of the week is a positive command, for it is written: "On the seventh day you shall rest" (Exodus 23:12). Anyone who works on it negates a positive command while transgressing a negative command, for it is written: "You shall do no work" (Exodus 20:10). What penalty does he deserve for doing work? If he did it voluntarily, willfully, he deserves <i>kareth;</i> if he acted in the presence of witnesses who forewarned him, he is stoned; if he acted unintentionally, he must bring a standard sin-offering.
In Sabbath laws, wherever it is stated that someone deserves punishment for doing something, he deserves <i>kareth;</i> if he acted despite the forewarning of witnesses, he deserves stoning; if he committed the transgression inadvertently, he has to bring a sin-offering.


It is permissible to perform an act on shabbat even if though doing so might lead to something forbidden or not lead to something forbidden. As long as one had no intention to have the forbidden labour performed, it is permitted to do so. What does that mean? A person may drag a bed, a chair, a bench and the like on the Shabbat, as long as the person does not intend to make a groove in the earth while dragging them. Therefore, even if the person did make a groove in the ground, it is of no consequence, for this was not the intention. Similarly, a person may tread on grass on the Shabbat, as long as the intent is not to uproot it. Thus, should it be uprooted, that is of no consequence. Also, a person may rub powdered herbs and the like over his hands, provided he does not intend to remove one's hair. Therefore, if the hair is removed, it is of no consequence. Based on the same rationale, one may enter a narrow opening on the Shabbat even though, one causes pieces of the wall to fall. Similarly, it is permissible to perform any act with similar results, as long as one does not have the intent of doing so.

Chapter 2

Like all other precepts, the Sabbath is set aside where human life is in danger. For a person who is dangerously ill everything may be done on the Sabbath at the bidding of a local competent physician.— —
If it has been estimated on the Sabbath that the patient will require a certain treatment for eight days, we must not say: "Let us wait till evening, so as not to desecrate two Sabbaths." We should rather begin the treatment from that Sabbath day, and desecrate even a hundred Sabbaths for his sake. As long as he needs treatment in the presence of danger or possible danger, we should desecrate the Sabbath for his sake by lighting or extinguishing a lamp, by slaughtering, baking, cooking, heating water for drinking or bathing. The gist of it all is: in consideration of a person who is seriously ill, the Sabbath is like a weekday regarding every thing he needs.
These things should not be performed by non-Jews, minors, servants or women, lest they consider the Sabbath a light matter; instead, scholars and sages of Israel are to carry them out. One must not put off the desecration of the Sabbath in treating a serious patient, as it is written: "If a man obeys them he shall live by them" (Leviticus 18:5), but he must not die by them. From this you may infer that the laws of the Torah are not meant to wreak vengeance upon the world, but to bestow on it mercy, kindliness, and peace.— —
If one feels pain in his eyes, being inflamed or affected by some disease, and pus, tears or blood flow from them, he is considered seriously ill, and we may break the Sabbath in preparing whatever cure he needs.










A woman who sat on the birthing chair and died - we bring a knife even from the public domain and cut open her womb and extract the fetus for it is possible that it still is alive. Safek nefashot (the possibility of saving life) pushes aside Shabbat even in this case where there is no presumption of life. 
We must save an endangered life on the Sabbath without first asking for permission from a religious authority. The more speedily a man saves a life, the more praise he deserves. If, for example, he sees a child falling into the lake on the Sabbath, he may cast a net and pull him out, even though he is likely to catch some fish along with him.





If a person traveling in the desert fails to know which day is Sabbath, he should count six days from the day he sensed the error and keep the seventh day as holy, reciting on it the Sabbath blessings, and the <i>Havdalah</i> at the conclusion of the Sabbath. Each day, even the day he recites the <i>Kiddush</i> and the <i>Havdalah</i>, he is allowed to do just enough for maintaining himself alive; he must not do more than is necessary to sustain himself, since each day there is doubt about Sabbath.— —

Chapter 3



Chapter 4



Chapter 5

The lighting of Sabbath lights is not of free choice, to light or not to light as one chooses, nor is it the kind of religious performance that an individual is not called upon to make a special effort to render, such as preparing an <i>eruv</i> in courtyards or washing the hands before eating. It is rather a duty, binding on men and women alike; they are obligated to have lamps burning in their homes on Sabbath eve. Even if one has nothing to eat, let him go begging at the doors, buy oil, and light a lamp, forming an integral part of Sabbath delight (<i>oneg shabbath</i>). Before lighting, one should recite a blessing: "Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us to light the Sabbath lights." This is on the same principle that one recites a benediction over all duties introduced by the sages.
It is permitted to use a Shabbat lamp. And this is [in the case] that the thing [one is doing] does not need much devotion. But if it is a thing that needs to be precise with regard to seeing, it is forbidden to use the light of the lamp for distinguishing - it is a decree lest one tilt [the lamp].
The Sabbath lights should be lit during daytime, before sunset. This duty is assigned to women rather than men, because women are usually at home doing housework. Nevertheless, the man should caution them, asking them about it, and telling them and the other members of his household, every Friday before it gets dark: "Light the lights!" If it is doubtful whether darkness has already fallen or not, whether the Sabbath has or has not begun, the lights may not be lit.
The period from sunset until the time when three stars of medium size become visible is called twilight. It is uncertain whether this period is part of the preceding day or of the following night. We generally decide in favor of greater stringency on this score; hence, the Sabbath lights may not be lit during twilight.

Chapter 6

It is forbidden to say to a non-Jew to do labor for us on Shabbat despite that he was not commanded regarding Shabbat and despite that he said to him [to do the labor] before Shabbat and despite that there is no need for this labor other than [until] after Shabbat. And this matter is forbidden according to the words of the Rabbis so that Shabbat will not be light in their eyes and they will come to do [labor] themselves.

Chapter 12








Transfer from one domain to another, in either direction, is one of the principal kinds of work [forbidden on the Sabbath].— — Also, it has been transmitted by tradition that if one carries an object in a public domain for a distance of four cubits (six feet) he is subject to punishment as if he transferred it from one domain to another.
One is not subject to punishment for transfer from one domain to another unless he transfers an object sizable enough to be of use either from a private domain to a public domain or from a public domain to a private domain, by detaching the object from the one domain and depositing it in the other. If, however, one detaches the object but does not deposit it, or deposits it without having first detached it, or transfers an object of less than the minimum size, he is free from liability. Similarly, if one transports an object for a distance of four cubits in a public domain, he is not subject to punishment unless he detaches the minimum size at one end and deposits it at the other.
He who throws or passes an object from one domain to another domain commits an act secondary to that of carrying an object from one domain to another, and is liable. Similarly, he who throws or passes an object a distance of four cubits in a public domain commits an act secondary to that of carrying an object from one domain to another, and is liable.— —

Chapter 13



Chapter 14

Four domains are distinguishable in connection with the Sabbath: the private domain, the public domain, the semi-public domain, and the exempted region. What is meant by a public domain? Deserts, forests, market places, and thoroughfares opening into them, provided that any such public road is at least sixteen cubits wide and has no roof over it. What is regarded as a private domain? A mound ten or more handbreadths high and four or more handbreadths square; a groove ten or more handbreadths deep and four or more handbreadths square; and any area four or more handbreadths square enclosed within walls at least ten handbreadths high. If such an area is enclosed for residential purposes, it may even be many miles in extent. Thus a walled town, the gates of which are closed at night; alleys having walls on three sides and a side-post on the fourth; and a courtyard, a sheepfold or a sheep-pen enclosed for residential purposes — — all are genuine private domains.


What is meant by a semi-public domain? A mound four or more handbreadths square and between three and ten handbreadths high, for no semi-public domain can ever be more than ten handbreadths high or less than four handbreadths square; a groove four or more handbreadths square and between three and ten handbreadths deep; an area four or more handbreadths square enclosed by walls between three and ten handbreadths high; a nook adjacent to a public domain, that is, an area enclosed by walls on three sides and with its fourth side opening into a public domain; for example, an alley that has neither a side-post nor crossbeam on the fourth side; lakes, and arable land in both summer and winter — — all are semi-public domains.


What is meant by an exempted region? An area less than four handbreadths square the height of which is from three handbreadths as far as the sky, since whatever is less than three handbreadths high is deemed part of the ground.— —



It is permissible to move objects throughout the whole of a private domain or an exempted region. Even if one of these two kinds of domain is several miles long, one may nevertheless move objects throughout the whole of it. In a public or semi-public domain, however, articles may not be moved more than four cubits at one time.— —
Just as it is permissible to move articles throughout the whole of an exempted region, so also it is permissible to transfer articles from an exempted region to a private or public domain, or, needless to say, to a semi-public domain. One may likewise bring articles into an exempted region from a private or a public domain, or, needless to say, from a semi-public domain.
Just as it is forbidden to move articles throughout the whole of a semi-public domain, so also it is forbidden to transfer articles from a semi-public domain to a private or a public domain, or to bring articles into a semi-public domain from a private or a public domain. If, however, one does transfer an object from a semi-public domain, or into it, he is free from liability.

Chapter 15

It is written in the Torah "you shall rest," implying that one must rest from doing things that are not even actual work. There are many things which the sages prohibited on the ground that they do not harmonize with the idea of rest. Some things are forbidden because they resemble prohibited kinds of work; others are forbidden as a preventive measure lest they may result in doing work that is forbidden under the penalty of stoning.— —
Whoever levels grooves in the ground is guilty of plowing [on the Sabbath].— —
Women who play games with walnuts, almonds, and the like, must not play with these on the Sabbath, lest they level grooves [on the bare ground, which is forbidden]. It is forbidden to sweep the ground, lest one levels grooves, unless it is paved with stones.— —



Fruit that dropped from a tree on the Sabbath may not be eaten until after the conclusion of the Sabbath, lest one may come to plucking growing fruit.— —

One may not ride an animal on the Sabbath, lest he may come to cutting off a branch for use in guiding it.— —

Chapter 16

Some acts are forbidden on the Sabbath even though they neither resemble nor lead to prohibited work. Why then were they forbidden? Because it is written: "If you refrain from following your business on the Sabbath, on my holy day… If you honor it, not following your wonted ways, not pursuing your business, nor speaking of it" (Isaiah 58:13). Hence, one is forbidden to go anywhere on the Sabbath in connection with his business, or even to talk about it. Thus one must not discuss with his partner what to sell on the next day, or what to buy, or how to build a certain house, or what merchandise to take to such-and-such a place. All this, and the like, is forbidden, for it is written "nor speaking of it." That is to say, speaking of business on the Sabbath is forbidden; thinking of it, however, is permitted.








If anything is forbidden because it conflicts with the idea of rest, the prohibition does not apply during twilight but during the actual Sabbath day. Indeed, during twilight such things are permitted if they are needed for some religious purpose or emergency.— — But if there is no emergency involved, nor religious purpose, it is forbidden.— —

The sages forbade the handling of certain articles on the Sabbath in the way they are handled on weekdays. Why did they enact such a prohibition? They reasoned as follows: Inasmuch as the prophets admonished us and charged us not to walk on the Sabbath in the manner we walk on weekdays, nor to converse on the Sabbath in the manner we converse on weekdays, since it is written "nor speaking of it," so much the more should we refrain from handling articles on the Sabbath in the manner they are handled on weekdays, so that one should not regard the Sabbath as if it were a weekday and be led to lift and rearrange articles from one corner to another or from one room to another, or to put stones out of the way, or do similar things. Since one is at leisure and at home, he might look about for something to do; the result would be that he would not rest at all, thus disregarding what is written in the Torah, "that they may rest…" (Exodus 23:12).

Chapter 17









It is forbidden to handle on the Sabbath any article of which a man takes particular care lest it may depreciate in value, such as tools set apart as merchandise or exceptionally valuable things that one carefully protects from deterioration. Such things are referred to as <i>set apart because of monetary loss</i>.— —
It is also forbidden to handle any article set apart because a prohibition is involved, such as a lamp which was lit for the Sabbath, or a <i>menorah</i> bearing a lighted candle, or a table with money on it, even if the light has gone out, and the money has fallen off the table.— —

Chapter 18

If one goes out beyond the limit of the town on the Sabbath, he is lashed, for it is written: "Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day" (Exodus 16:29), and <i>place</i> in this verse signifies <i>city limit</i>. The Torah does not define the extent of this limit, but the Sages had a tradition that it is twelve miles, corresponding to the size of the Israelite camp in the wilderness; so this is what our teacher Moses meant to say to them: You shall not go out of the camp. The sages have enacted that one may not go out of the town beyond two thousand cubits, for two thousand cubits (0.7 miles) is defined as <i>open land about the city</i> (Numbers 35:5).
From this you may conclude that one may walk anywhere within the city on the Sabbath, even if it is large as Nineveh, whether it is walled or not. Furthermore, one may walk up to two thousand cubits outside of the city limits in any direction, the permitted area resembling a square tablet.— —

Chapter 19

It is a positive duty to express the sanctity of the Sabbath day in words, for it is written: "Remember to sanctify the Sabbath day" (Exodus 20:8); that is to say, remember it in terms of praise and sanctification. One should remember it at its beginning and its conclusion by reciting the <i>Kiddush</i> when the Sabbath begins and the <i>Havdalah</i> when it ends.



One must not eat anything or drink wine once the Sabbath has arrived until he has recited the <i>Kiddush</i> benediction. Similarly, when the Sabbath has come to an end, one must not begin to eat or to drink, to do any work or even to taste anything at all, until he recites the <i>Havdalah;</i> one may, however, drink water.
The sages ordained that both the <i>Kiddush</i> and the <i>Havdalah</i> should be recited over wine. Even though he has already said the <i>Havdalah</i> as part of the evening service, he must recite it again over a cup of wine.— —

The <i>Kiddush</i> should be recited only where the meal is served. This means that a person is not to recite the <i>Kiddush</i> in one house and eat in another; but if he has recited the <i>Kiddush</i> in one corner of a room, he may eat in another corner. Why then is the <i>Kiddush</i> recited in the synagogue? For the benefit of transients who eat and drink there.









Just as <i>Kiddush</i> is recited on Friday nights and <i>Havdalah</i> on Saturday nights, so also is <i>Kiddush</i> recited on festival nights, and <i>Havdalah</i> at the termination of festivals and <i>Yom Kippur</i>, since all these are called <i>Sabbaths of the Lord</i> (Leviticus 23:38). <i>Havdalah</i> is recited also at the termination of a festival followed by <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i> and at the termination of a Sabbath followed by a festival, but is not recited at the termination of a festival followed by a Sabbath.










Why is a blessing recited over fragrant spices at the conclusion of the Sabbath? It is to cheer the soul which is saddened at the departure of the Sabbath.

Chapter 20



Chapter 21

In the Torah, it states (Exodus 23:12, et. al.), "you shall rest." [Hence] one is obligated to rest even from things that are not constructive labor (<i>melakha</i>). And there are many things that were forbidden by the Sages and deemed a <i>shevut</i> (a restriction decreed by the Sages regarding Shabbat). Some of them are things forbidden because they are similar to constructive labors, and some of them are things forbidden as a decree lest one go from them to [doing] that which is forbidden [and would result in the punishment] of stoning. And these are them:
Anyone who levels indentations [in the ground], behold this one is liable because of plowing. Therefore, it is forbidden to defecate in a clear field on the Sabbath [as] a decree lest he level indentations. The one who clears the storehouse on the Sabbath because he needs it for a matter of commandment, for example, he brings in guests or he establishes a place to study, he does not complete [the cleaning] of the entire storehouse lest he come to level indentations. Mud that is on his feet, he wipes on the wall or on a beam, but not on the ground lest he will come to level indentations. One may not spit ion the ground and trample it with his foot lest he level indentations. But it is permitted to tread on the spit that is on the ground and walk innocently.  
Women who play with walnuts and almonds, and things similar to them are forbidden to play with them on the Sabbath lest they will come to level indentations. And it is forbidden to sweep the ground lest one level indentations unless it was paved with stones. And it is permitted to spray water on the ground and there is no concern lest one level indentations in that behold there is no intention for such. We do not rub oil on the ground even if it was paved with stones, and we do not blow on it, and we do not wash it even on holy days of Festivals, and all the more so on the Sabbath, so that one will not act in the way the one acts on an ordinary day and come to level indentations at a time that he acts such in a place that is not paved.



Fruits that fell on the Sabbath - it is forbidden to eat them until the going out of the Sabbath - this is a decree lest one pluck [fruit]. A myrtle that is attached - one is permitted to smell it since it has no benefit other than to smell it, and behold its smell is found [even while attached]. But an citron [etrog] or an apple, and anything appropriate for eating is forbidden to smell it while attached [as] a decree lest one cut it off to eat it.

We may not ride on the back of an animal on Shabbat. It is a decree, lest one will cut off a twig to [prod] it. And we may not suspend [things] on an animal and one may not climb an animal while it is still day [before Shabbat] in order to sit upon it on Shabbat. And we may not lean against the side of an animal. [But leaning on something that is leaning against] the sides of an animal is permissible. One who climbed a tree on Shabbat inadvertently is allowed to come down. [If he did so] knowingly, he is forbidden to come down. And concerning an animal; even [if he climbed on it] knowingly, he should come down because of [the prohibition of] causing pain to animals. And so [too], we may discharge the load from on the back of an animal on Shabbat because of causing pain to animals.

Chapter 22


Why did the Sages forbid entering a bathhouse on Shabbat? Because of the attendants who would heat hot water on Shabbat and say it had been heated before Shabbat. Therefore they decreed that a person may not enter the bathhouse on Shabbat even sweat. And they decreed that one may not wash all of one's body in hot water, not even in hot water that was heated on the [prior to] Shabbat; but one's face and one's hands, and one's feet are permitted. Regarding what case are we talking? About hot water heated by fire- a decree because of the bathhouse. But the hot waters of Tiberias, and similar, in it, it is permitted to wash one's whole body in them. And it is forbidden to wash in hot water that is in caves, because the caverns have steam, and one will come to sweat, and do it was considered to be like a bathhouse.

Chapter 23



Chapter 24

There are things that are forbidden on the Sabbath even though they are not similar to creative labor and they do not bring [one] [to doing] creative labor. And because of what were [they] forbidden? Because it was said "If because of the Sabbath you refrain your feet from acting on your concerns on My holy day" (Isaiah 58:13) and it was said, "And you shall honor it, [refraining] from doing your ways, from finding your desires and from speaking about a matter" (Isaiah 58:13). Therefore it is forbidden for a person to go [after] one's concerns on the Sabbath, and even to speak about them. For example, if one would speak with one's business partner [about] what he will sell the following day or what he will buy or how he will build this house or regarding which merchandise will go to a certain person's place. All of this and similar cases are forbidden, as it says: "speaking about a matter" - speaking is forbidden; thinking is permitted.








All the things that are forbidden because of <i>sh'vut</i>: it was not decreed regarding them <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> [i.e. between sunset and twilight], but rather it is during the actual day that they are forbidden, but <i>bein ha-shamashot </i> they are permitted, and [this case] is when there is a matter of commandment or an urgent matter. How? It is permitted for him <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> to climb a tree or to swim in the water to bring a <i>lulav</i> or a <i>shofar</i>. And similarly bringing down from a tree or bringing out from a semi-public domain an <i>eruv</i> that one made. And similarly if one is troubled, hurried, or in need of a thing that is a matter of <i>sh'vut</i>, <i>bein ha-shamashot</i>, behold it is permitted. But if there was not an urgent matter and there was no matter of a commandment there, it is forbidden. Therefore, we do not tithe what is certain [i.e. know to be untithed] <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> even though the separation of tithes on the Sabbath is forbidden because of <i>sh'vut</i>. But we tithe <i>d'mai</i> [i.e. produce that we are unsure if it has been tithed].

The Sages forbade the carrying of some things on the Sabbath in the way that one does it on an ordinary day. And because of what did this prohibition come to pass? And they said: just as the Prophets warned us  and commanded us that your walking on the Sabbath should not be like your walking on an ordinary day and the conversation of the Sabbath like the conversation of an ordinary day, as was said  "and speak of a matter", <i>kal v'chomer</i> [i.e. an a fortiori argument] that  there should not be any carrying  on the Sabbath like the carrying on an ordinary day so that it will not be like an ordinary day in one's eyes and one will come to lift and repair items [moving them] from corner to corner or house to house or move stones away, and similar cases, in that behold one is idle and sits in one's house and loosk for something to busy oneself with. And we would find that he did not rest and had nullified the meaning of what was said "so that one will rest" (Exodus 23:12).

Chapter 25









Any item that one is careful regarding it lest it should decrease in is value, for example, things set aside as merchandise and particularly expensive items that one is careful regarding them lest they deteriorate, it is forbidden to carry them on the Sabbath. And this is what is called <i>"muktzah</i> because of a monetary loss." For example: the large file, a pin of the plow, a butcher's knife, a knife of a leatherworker, the carpenter's spade, a spice-dealer's mallet, or similar cases.
Any item that has been set aside because it is forbidden, it is forbidden to carry it. For example, a lamp that they lit regarding the Sabbath and the <i>menorah</i> that has the lamp upon it, and the table that has money on it, even though the lamp went out or the money fell, it is forbidden to carry them, in that anything that was forbidden to carry <i>bein ha-shamashot</i> [between sunset and twilight], it is forbidden to carry it during the entire Sabbath even though the thing that caused the prohibition has gone.

Chapter 26



Chapter 27

The one who goes outside the boundary of the city on the Sabbath is lashed, as it is said, "one shall not go out from one's place on the seventh day" (Exodus 16:29). This "place" is the boundary of the city. And the Torah dod not give the amount [of distance] for this boundary, but the Sages had a tradition that this boundary was 12 <i>mil</i> outside, equal to the Israelites camp. And thus Moses our teacher said to them: do not go outside the camp. And from the words of the [Rabbis], a person shall not go outside the city other than 2000 cubits, but outside of 2000 cubits is forbidden, in that 2000 cubits is the pasture land of the city....
You find from what was learned that a person is permitted on the Sabbath to walk the entire city, even if it was [as big as] Nineveh, whether it was surrounded by a wall or not surrounded by a wall. And similarly, it is permitted to walk outside the city 2000 cubits in every direction, square, like a square tablet such that one benefits from the corners. And if one went outside 2000 cubits, we lash him with lashes of rebellion until 12 <i>mil</i>. But if he went out and distanced [himself] from the city more than 12 <i>mil</i>, even one cubit, he is lashed from the [law of] the Torah.

Chapter 28



Chapter 29

It is biblically mandated positive commandment to sanctify the Sabbath with speech, as it is written (Exodus 20, 7): "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." i.e. Remember through remembrance of praise and through Kiddush. And it must be remembered when it begins and when it ends. When it begins - with Kiddush, and when it ends - with Havdala...
And this is the language of sanctifying the day (Kiddush). Blessed are You, HaShem, our God, Eternal Sovereign, Who sanctified us through the commandments, and desired us, and has given us the Holy Sabbath through love and desire as an inheritance, a memorial for the works of creation.  First of all holy occasions, a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt, for You chose us and set us as different than all peoples, and You gave us through love and desire Your Holy Sabbath as an inheritance.  Blessed are You, HaShem, Who Sanctifies the Sabbath.
..
The essential time to make <i>Kiddush</i> is in the evening. If you did not make <i>Kiddush</i> in the evening whether accidentally or on purpose, you make <i>Kiddush</i> at any point in the day time. Similarly, if you did not make <i>Havdalah</i> at night you may make <i>Havdalah</i> the next day or at any point before the end of Tuesday. However, <i>Havdalah</i> with a candle is only made when <i>Havdalah</i> is made on a Saturday night.
It is forbidden for a person to eat or drink wine from the time when the day became sanctified until he sanctifies the day [with <i>Kiddush</i>]. And similarly from when the day goes out, it is forbidden for him to begin to eat and drink and to do creative labor or to taste anything a until he separates [makes <i>Havdalah</i>] And to drink water is permitted. If he forgot or it passed and he ate or drank before he sanctified or before he separated, behold this one sanctifies or separates after he eats.
It is from the words of the Sages to sanctify over the wine and to separate over the wine. And even though one separated during the Prayer [i.e. Amidah], one needs to separate over the cup. And after one separates [during the Prayer] and one says "between holy and ordinary", it is permitted for one to do creative labor, even though one has not separated over the cup. And one blesses of the wine first, and after that sanctifies. And one does not wash one's hands until one sanctifies.

<i>Kiddush</i> is only done in the place of a meal. How? One does not make <i>Kiddush</i> in one house and eat in another house. However, if one made <i>Kiddush</i> in one corner, one can eat in another corner. And why do we make <i>Kiddush</i> in the synagogue? Because of the guests, who eat and drink there.





One may only make <i>Kiddush</i> on wine that is suitable to have been offered on the altar. Therefore, if honey or leaven was mixed with the wine, even if only a mustard seed sized was mixed with a barrel full of wine, one can not make <i>Kiddush</i> on that mixture. That is how we instruct people to act in all of the West. However, there are are those that do permit the use of wine mixtures for <i>Kiddush</i>. They are of the opinion that the suitability of wine mixtures is not based on wine that can be offered on the altar. Rather, the only prohibited wines are those that have a bad odor or were left uncovered or were cooked. On any one of those wines you can not make <i>Kiddush</i>.



Just as we sanctify on the night of the Sabbath and separate upon the going out of the Sabbath, so too we sanctify on the nights of holy days of Festivals and separate upon their going out and upon the going out of the Day of Atonement, in that all of them are sabbaths of the LORD. And we separate upon the going out of holy days of Festivals into ordinary days of the Festival and upon the going out of the Sabbath into holy days of Festivals, but we do not separate upon the going out of Yom Tov into the Sabbath.










And why do we bless over the spices at the going out of the Sabbath? Because the soul is saddened at the going out of the Sabbath, we gladden it and settle it down with a good smell.

Chapter 30

Four things have been enjoined regarding the Sabbath: two on biblical authority, and two on the authority of the sages and clearly expressed by the Prophets. The Torah says: <i>Remember</i> (Exodus 20:8) and <i>Observe</i> (Deuteronomy 5:12); the Prophets clearly speak of <i>Honor</i> and <i>Delight</i>, as it is written: "Call the Sabbath a delight, and the Lord's sacred day an honor" (Isaiah 58:13).
What is meant by <i>honor</i>? The sages explained this by declaring that each person should wash his face, hands and feet with hot water on Friday in honor of the Sabbath, and then enwrap himself in a fringed garment and be seated with dignity in expectation of the Sabbath, receiving it as if he were coming out to meet the king. The ancient sages used to assemble their disciples on Friday, put on their best clothes, and say: "Come, let us go out to meet King Sabbath."
We honor the Sabbath by wearing clean clothes. One must not wear weekday apparel on the Sabbath.— —
In deference to the Sabbath, it is forbidden to arrange for a festive meal to take place on Friday; it is, however, permissible to eat and drink until nightfall. Nevertheless, in deference to the Sabbath, one should refrain from having a regular meal the entire afternoon, that he may enter the Sabbath with a desire to eat.
One should spread his Sabbath table on Friday, even if he requires no more than an olive's bulk of food; so too, he should set his table at the end of the Sabbath, even if he requires only a minute amount of food, in order to honor the Sabbath both at its entrance and departure. One should also set the house in order on Friday before sunset in honor of the Sabbath. A lamp should be lit, a table spread, and a bed properly arranged. All these are marks of respect for the Sabbath.
Even a person of high rank, who does not as a rule buy things at the market or engage in household chores, should himself perform what is necessary for the Sabbath, for this is his way of showing respect. Some of the ancient sages used to chop wood for the cooking; others used to cook or salt meat or twine wicks or light lamps; others used to go out and buy food and drinks for the Sabbath, although none of them would usually do such things on weekdays. The more anyone honors the Sabbath in this manner, the more praise he deserves.
What is meant by Sabbath delight? The sages explained this by declaring that one should prepare rich food and fragrant beverages for the Sabbath as much as he can afford. The more anyone spends for the Sabbath and the preparation of varied tasty food, the more praise he deserves. If, however, he cannot afford this, he may fulfill the Sabbath-delight requirement by preparing anything like a vegetable stew in honor of the Sabbath. He is not obligated to strain himself, begging from others, in order to eat much on the Sabbath. The ancient sages said: "Rather make your Sabbath a weekday [with regard to festive meals] than be dependent on people."
If a person is comfortably rich and all his days are like Sabbath, he should eat different food on the Sabbath as a mark of distinction from the weekday food. If no change is possible, he should at least modify the schedule of his meals by eating later or earlier than usual.
One should eat three meals on the Sabbath: one in the evening, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon.— —
Eating meat and drinking wine is considered delight (oneg), as long as he can afford it. It is not permissible though to sit down for a meal on wine on Shabbat and festivals at the time of communal learning. This then was the custom of the early righteous ones. They would pray the morning and additional service in the synagogue, then go to their home and eat the second meal, and then return to the study house to read [Torah] and repeat [Mishnah] and pray the afternoon service, and afterwards sit down for a meal on wine and eat and drink until Shabbat has ended.
One must not travel more than three Persian miles (12 miles) beginning on Friday morning, so that he may arrive home when the day is still high and prepare his Sabbath meals; otherwise, his family would not know that he is coming home, in order to prepare food for him. Needless to say, if he is going to be the guest of others he should arrive early; otherwise, he would embarrass them, since they would have nothing prepared that is suited for guests.
It is forbidden to fast and to sound trumpets and to supplicate and to beg for mercy on Shabbat. Even for such [grave] troubles that the community would [ordinarily] fast and cry out because of them; on the Sabbath and festivals we do not fast and sound trumpets, aside from a city that is surrounded by non-Jews or a river, or a ship that is shipwrecked. In these [cases] we sound trumpets on the Shabbat to [encourage others to] aid them and we supplicate and ask for mercy for them.
— — A sea voyage should not begin later than three days before the Sabbath, so that one's mind should be at ease before the Sabbath, and that he should not be excessively uncomfortable.— —
Marital relations are included in the obligation of enjoyment of the Shabbat. Therefore Torah scholars fulfill their marital obligations once a week, on the Shabbat. It is permissible to have marital relations with a virgin, even in the first instance, and there is no transgression of (the Shabbat laws) of "injuring" or "pain" to her.
