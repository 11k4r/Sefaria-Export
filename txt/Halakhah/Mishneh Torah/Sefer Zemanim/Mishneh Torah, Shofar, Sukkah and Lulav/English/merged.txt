Mishneh Torah, Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav



Chapter 1

It is a biblical commandment to hear the sound of the shofar on Rosh Hashannah as it says "it is a day of blowing the horn unto you." The horn which is blown, both on Rosh Hashannah and for the Jubilee year, is a bent ram's horn. All Shofars are invalid except the horn of a ram. Even though a Shofar is not mentioned explicitly in the passage about Rosh Hashannah, it does say in the passage about the Jubilee year "Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of the Shofar" and we have learned through the Tradition that just as the "teruah" of the Jubilee year is with a shofar, so is the "teruah" of Rosh Hashannah.

A priori, we do not blow with a shofar of idolaters (gentiles). But if one blew [with one], he has fulfilled [the commandment]. And if one blew [with a shofar] of a condemned city (<i>eer hanidachat</i>), he has not fulfilled [it]. With a stolen shofar with which he has blown, he has fulfilled [it]; as the commandment is only listening to the sound - even though he did not touch it and did not raise it up, the listener has fulfilled [it]; and there is no law of theft with sound. And so [too with] the shofar of a burnt offering, he should not blow, but if he blew, he has fulfilled [it]; as there is no law of misappropriating [the sacred] with sound. And if you say, "Did he not derive pleasure from listening to the sound"; [the answer is] that the commandments are not given for pleasure . Therefore, one who has vowed not to derive pleasure from the shofar is permitted to blow the blow of the commandment with it.

Chapter 2



Chapter 3

How many blasts is one required to hear on Rosh Hashana? Nine Tekias. This is because the Torah writes 'teruah' with regards to the jubilee year and Rosh Hashana three times. Every 'teruah' requires a straight blast before and after it. Through oral tradition, we learn that all 'teruahs' in the seventh month are the same, whether for Rosh Hashana, or Yom Kippur of the jubilee year, we blow nine blasts. [The setup is] Tekiah, Teruah, Tekiah. Tekiah, Teruah, Tekiah. Tekiah, Teruah, Tekiah.
This Teruah that the Torah discusses, due to the many years of exile, we are unsure what it is. It may be the wail that women wail amongst themselves whilst crying. It may be the sigh that one does, one after the other, whilst they are worried about a great stress. It may also be both together, the sigh followed by the cry, as it usually comes afterwards. This may be called teruah, as this is the way of a worrier, to first sigh, and then cry. We therefore do all options.
The wail is what we call 'Teruah'. The sighing, one after another, is what we called three 'Shevarim'. The order of shofar blasts is therefore thus. The blessing is recited, Tekia is sounded, followed by three Shevarim, a Teruah and a Tekia. This is repeated three times. Then Tekiah is sounded, followed by three Shevarim and a Tekiah. This is repeated three times. Then Tekiah is sounded, followed by Teruah and Tekiah. This is also repeated three times. Therefore, the numbers of blasts is thirty, in order to avoid any doubts.

Chapter 4



Chapter 5

The covering of the sukkah is not kosher from all materials.  One may cover only with materials that grew from the earth, that was uprooted from the earth and that is not susceptible to ritual impurity (tumah) and does not have a bad smell nor has fallen or is wilted.

Chapter 6



Chapter 7

The <i>branches of palm trees</i> specified in the Torah (Leviticus 23:40) are freshly sprouted twigs of a palm tree, before their leaves are spread apart; they resemble a rod, called <i>lulav</i>.
The <i>fruit of goodly trees</i> specified in the Torah is the <i>ethrog</i>. The <i>boughs of leafy trees</i> specified in the Torah refer to the myrtle, the leaves of which cover the wood; it has, for example, three or more leaves growing from each bud.
The <i>willows of the brook</i> specified in the Torah do not refer to every plant growing near a brook, but to a definite kind of plant called <i>willows of the brook</i>. Its leaf is elongated like a brook and has a smooth edge, and its twig is red. This is called <i>aravah</i>, willow. Most plants of this kind grow beside brooks, hence the term <i>willows of the brook;</i> even if it grows in the wilderness or on the mountains it is fit for use.

The four species [described above] constitute one precept, and the absence of any of these makes the others useless. All of them are included under the term <i>lulav precept;</i> their number should be neither decreased nor increased.— —

How many should be taken of each species? One <i>lulav</i>, one <i>ethrog</i>, two twigs of willow, and three twigs of myrtle. If one wishes to increase the number of myrtle twigs so that the bunch should be larger, he may do so.— —





We are required to wave the <i>lulav</i> on the first day of <i>Sukkoth</i> only, anywhere and at any time, even if this happens to be a Sabbath, as it is written: "You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees" (Leviticus 23:40). Only in the Temple was the <i>lulav</i> waved on each of the seven days of <i>Sukkoth</i>, as it is written: "You shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days…"— —

After the destruction of the Temple it was ruled that the <i>lulav</i> should be waved on each of the seven days of the festival, in remembrance of the Temple usage.— —



Anyone who is required to hear the <i>shofar</i> and to dwell in a <i>sukkah</i> is also required to wave the <i>lulav;</i> anyone who is exempt from hearing the <i>shofar</i> and dwelling in a <i>sukkah</i> is likewise exempt from waving the <i>lulav</i>. A little boy who knows how to shake the <i>lulav</i> is required to do so, by rabbinic rule, in order to train him in the observance of precepts.




The custom in Jerusalem used to be that an individual would leave home carrying his <i>lulav</i>, go to synagogue with <i>lulav</i> in hand, worship with <i>lulav</i> in hand, and then go to visit the sick and comfort the mourners with <i>lulav</i> still in hand. But when he was about to enter the school-house, he would send his <i>lulav</i> home with his son or servant (Sukkah 41b).

Chapter 8











If partners bought a Lulav or Etrog together, neither of them can fulfill the Mitzva on the first day until the other gives him his portion as a gift. If brothers bought multiple Etrogs with money from a shared estate and one brother took one etrog on the first day, he has fulfilled his obligation. However if they keep accounts of the estate money he has not fulfilled his obligation until the other brother gives it to him as a gift. And even if one bought an Etrog and the other a quince or one bought an etrog, a quince, and a pomegranate he has not discharged his obligation until the other brother gives him his share in the fruit even if he would not mind under normal circumstances if the first brother ate it.
Although we are required to rejoice on all festivals, there was special rejoicing in the Temple during the <i>Sukkoth</i> festival, as it is written: "You shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days" (Leviticus 23:40). How was this done? On the day preceding the first day of <i>Sukkoth</i>, a raised section for women and a lower section for men were prepared in the Temple, so that they might not mix. They began to celebrate at the conclusion of the first day of the festival. On each day of <i>Hol ha-Mo'ed</i>, the celebrations began after the daily afternoon sacrifice and continued for the rest of the day and the entire night.
How was this celebration observed? Flutes were sounded, and harps, lyres and cymbals were played. Anyone who could play an instrument, played it; anyone who could sing, sang. They danced, clapping hands and leaping, each one to the best of his ability. However, this celebration was not permitted on the Sabbath or on the first day of the festival.
It was a religious duty to observe this celebration as much as possible. Ignorant individuals, or anybody who wished [to participate] took no leading part in it. Only great Jewish scholars, heads of academies, members of the Sanhedrin, elders, and men of piety and good deeds danced, clapped hands, made music and entertained in the Temple in the days of <i>Sukkoth</i>. Everyone else, men and women, came to watch and listen.
The joy which a person derives from doing good deeds and from loving God, who has commanded us to practise them, is a supreme form of divine worship. Anyone who refrains from experiencing this joy deserves punishment, as it is written: "Because you have not served the Lord your God with joy and with a glad heart" (Deuteronomy 28:47). Anyone who is arrogant and insists on self-glory on such occasions is both a sinner and a fool. King Solomon had this in mind when he said: "Do not glorify yourself in the presence of the King" (Proverbs 25:6). On the other hand, anyone who humbles himself on such occasions is indeed great and honored, for he serves the Lord out of love. David, King of Israel, expressed this thought when he said: "I will make myself even more contemptible than this, humbling myself in my own eyes" (II Samuel 6:22). True greatness and honor are attained only by rejoicing before the Lord, as it is written: "King David was leaping and dancing before the Lord" (II Samuel 6:16).
