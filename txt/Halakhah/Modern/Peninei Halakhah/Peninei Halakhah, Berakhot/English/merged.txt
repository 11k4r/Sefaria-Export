And to add to the issue that overeating is harmful to health, it is forbidden for a person to overindulge in physical cravings. And the Ramban explained that therefore the Torah commanded "you shall be holy" (Lev. 19:2). If the Torah had not commanded us to be holy, a person could become "a scoundrel with the permission of the Torah", to gorge in meat with no limits, and to get drunk in wine and other strong drinks, all the while affirming that they are not doing any transgression, since the meat and wine are kosher to the best degree. Therefore the Torah commanded "you shall be holy", that one should not eat like an animal.
And the Torah has not defined precisely the limits of what eating like an animal looks like because the needs of people differ, there are those with big bodies and those with small bodies, there are those in whom food passes quickly, and therefore they need more food, and there are others in whom food passes slowly, and so they need less food. And there are those whose bodies are similar, but who work in different jobs, one who works hard with manual labor, and so needs more food, and one's friend works in an easy job, and so needs less food.
