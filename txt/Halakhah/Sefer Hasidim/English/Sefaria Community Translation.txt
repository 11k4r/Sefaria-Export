Chapter 1



Chapter 2

And so said the author of this book, the one who compiled the words of piety, humility and fear, each of them present in the book that I have contemplated and comprehended due to my mentors and teachers, because it is proper for all G-d fearing people to instruct their offsprings and students and all People of Israel as to how to fulfill the Will of our Creator, blessed be His Name and extolled be the mention of Him. And so are the teachings of His words: to describe Him using attributes relevant to those of a human of flesh and blood in order to penetrate human hearts of flesh to make it understood to the human ear, open their unseeing eyes and make their uncircumcised hearts comprehend. And so it is stated in the Torah: "His voice is like that of multiple waters... Hashem like a lion shall roar". And so He would appear to His creations: "His eyes like doves..." and the like... "His legs like pillars of marble..." - and all this only in order to make it understood to the human ear.

It is forbidden to tear clothes or break vessels in anger because he who breaks a vessel in his anger it is as if he worships idolatry for such is the way of the evil inclination: at first it tells you to do thus, and the next day it tells you to go and worship idols and one goes and does so.

Never should a person rely on miracles fot it is possible that they won't perform a miracle for him and even if they will - could be that they'll diminish his merits on account of this.

If you are arguing with a wise man don't be distressed if he took the upper hand because he possesses scholarship and thus you add to your knowledge. If you take the upper hand what will you gain? However if he won the argument you only gained because now you know what you didn't know before this.

There was an incident with a young woman who would not adorn herself. They said to her: "Whoever will see you will not take you for a wife  because you do not adorn yourself" She replied: "Just because the Holy one Blessed be He is engaged in matchmaking - I do not worry about it." And it came to pass that she was taken for a wife by a Torah scholar who was a tsadik.

One should not travel with a wicked person neither on the same road, nor on the same ship lest he be damaged on his account. Don't hang around with a wicked person who causes damage to many (neither on a road nor on a ship) as is written "... So that you won't perish because of their wicked deeds" (Bemidbar 16:26)

Chapter 399

If a simple person unintentionally made profit in a prohibited way because he got deluded by his heart (without intent) - he shouldn't mix it with his (other) money as is stated "Will you even destroy the righteous with the wicked?" 

Chapter 400

One man who gambled with his fellow with dices won and the one who lost went and stole a wooden piece used for playing like one called "tsahekes shkeki" and the like... Thereafter he went forth and won off the sum he previously lost. (Later on) he posed the question whether any guilt lies on him (for what he had done). The answer he got was: "One who steals from a thief tastes a taste of theft himself. Furthermore (the very actions of yours) proved that you got despaired  of your money.
However where one saves his property from a robber it is allowed for him to take immediate legal action on the spot (and this is how you should have acted)".

Chapter 401

Anyone who lends money to rulers who engage in libels - it is as if he robs Israel because if he lends it the ruller might tell him "Give me back my security and believe me (even without it) And if not I'll go capture a jew!". And it can end up with the ruller making an oath (in the name of idolatry).

Chapter 402

A person should always weigh money or count it prior to giving or taking it even though (his partners) are trustworthy because it may come to pass that money will be partially lost without one's knowledge or another person will take it in the interim. It comes out that if one doesn't weigh or count money in the first place - they might come to suspect each other in stealing (in case something is missing).

If a person was in a synagogue and saw through a window a house of idolatry or an idol or a graven image - he should place something in the window in order to block their view.

Chapter 438

There was one man in a village who needed a willow branch and he didn't find so beautiful a willow branch as in a yard of idolatry by water. A wise person said to him: you'd better take the one which is not so beautiful rather than that beautiful one from the yard because you will not find grace (if you take the latter).

Chapter 439

There was not much water in one town in order to suffice for immersion however that place was broad and attractive for jews to settle there. A wise person said to them: "For the reason that thieves use that water - it is not proper for women to immerse there. And if one happens to immerse in that water knives or metal or glass utensils - it's not good to recite a blessing to G-d's name".

There was an incident involving a gentile who was sitting with a sad countenance. His fellow said to him: "Why are you so bitter?" He returned: "I saw in a dream a rider on a red horse that was standing by an elevated platform". The fellow replied that this means that he will speedily pass away on a bed. The dream reader asked him that if he gives him to drink he will buy off his dream from him. He said: "I shall give you to drink on condition that my dream will be sold off to you." And his fellow accepted it whereupon the man give him to drink." On the next day the dream reader died. 
One man was deathly ill where another one was making fun, so he said "Sell me your disease and give me such and such" He said: "I will give it to you". Immediately this one rose up and this one took ill and died.

There is a night when the souls come out of their graves, like on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, when they come out and pray. And two people already went and hid themselves in the graveyard and heard that one was calling to her friend: Let us go and pray together! All of the souls came out and prayed and asked for mercy so that death would not be decreed upon the living, and those who will die that they return from their evil ways, and that they die through minor illness, and about every matter of the living and the dead; and about themselves, to quickly remove judgement from upon them and from upon others - and they told their congregation. The next year on the eve of Hoshana Rabba, two others went and only one virgin didn't come out of the grave, who had died last week. They said: Come out! She said: I cannot, because my father was rich and lost his possessions and buried me without clothing. And they heard that some of the souls said we will not gather together because two have already revealed us to many. Rather, each one of us will pray in the grave, so that the living will not hear and tell the nation. And they became angry at the father and took clothing and clothed that virgin. And when a shroud decays it does not hold back the soul for behold despite body's decay the soul rests in the bones although it departs from dead body as is known that (sorcerers) who raise a spirit bring it by means of dust that absorbed from the dead.
It happened that one man didn't see his head's shaddow on Hoshana Rabbah's night, so he and his loving ones fasted numerous fasts and gave a lot to tzedakah and lived many years after that as is said "Tzedakah saves from death".

If a person was walking along the road close to which there was mud, and he encountered a man under a burden - he should step back and let the man under a burden pass. And even if the man carrying a burden was a gentile, for it is written: "And find favor and good apprehension in the eyes of G-d and man" (Mishlei 3, 4). And it is better that you acquiesce  to another person than he will acquiesce to you.

A father who commends his son to give a bill of divorce to his wife, and he did not find any iniquity in her, but wants this just for no reason - his son is not obligated to hearken to his word if the woman is good and does not angry neither her husband, nor his father and mother.

Great in power we did not find Him, meaning He did not overburden Israel with mitzvot. And if you will object "How about regulations about theft and forbidden sexual relations?" (The answer is) even if these laws were not written down one would have to keep them, otherwise the world would not be able to stand, for behold, rams and roosters wedge battles for females, so would people kill each other for this matter. And so a father should not command his son to perform an exacting or tiresome task, likewise a teacher should not act in the like manner towards his student lest they fail to accomplish the task and it will come out that (father or teacher) caused him to sin. And so a father should not leave to many possessions as inheritance to his son unless he does so for Heaven's sake.

One who left the city where there are his father and mother and he is going to a dangerous place. And his parents keep a fast or experience anguish even without a fast - it is a mitzvah for the son, if he is able to, to immediately hire a messenger and send a written note that he left the dangerous place and arrived to the place he wanted to go to, so that they will not fast or experience anguish anymore.

If there were two people in a city, say, Ruben and Shimon and Shimon was accustomed to honoring Ruben, he should not let Shimon honor him by doing something that would be embarrassing for Shimon, for instance if this was not the way of Shimon  to bring water from a well. And even if for Shimon it is fine whereas for his family it is an embarrassment - Ruben should not let Shimon honor him. 

Chapter 582

There was one person who was wealthy and his son was wealthy as well. And the father was stingy about his food and drink. A wise person told the son "Even though you father has wealth - seeing that your father is stingy give him honor and feed him and give him to drink from your own and also clothe him"

If it will come to pass that a person who doesn't know   holy tongue (lashon ivri) will come to you and he is a heaven fearing person who wants to pray with intent or if a woman will come to you - tell them that they should learn how to pray in the language they understand, because prayer requires understanding in one's heart, on the contrary if one's heart does not understand what one utters with his mouth - of what use will this be to him... That's why it is better that one prays in the language he understands.

There was an incident: one jew traveled to a distant place and saw in a night dream another jew whom they weighed on heavenly scales: he was put on one side of the scales whereas his sins were put on the other side. As a result his sins outweighed and they said to him that seeing that his sins outweighed he has no portion in the World to Come. After that came in another ones and said: "You didn't weigh correctly!" And they put on that man fox skins and other skins so the man outweighed and they declared that he does have a portion in the World to Come. The man who saw this in his dream thought that the man was alive whereas in fact the man whom they weighed was already dead by that moment. They said: those skins that were put on him were the ones he gave as a tax as is written: "... (I will make) your rullers righteousnes (Yeshayahu 60). When a congregation sees fit to impose a tax and one gives it in good faith - it is thought to be a tzedakah for them. An as for the body that they weighed it is written: "You were weighed on the scales and found wanting" (Daniel 5). Alternative explanation: ... in the merit of the fact that he strived with his body to perform good deeds.

One who washes a dead person should take great care not to leave any dirt on him and so the one who takes care of a grave and puts him down should see to it that no earth dirt is present on a dead man's face because it may cause him embarrassment before other souls for they have a body-like appearance.

A town in which two people passed away - they first take out the first one lest they be unable to take care of both of the two simultaneously.

The Holy one blessed be He judges a man only together with upper host and if you will object that our sages of blessed memory said: "No one judges alone, but He'' - one can answer that this refers to judging a nation or a king. And if The Holy one blessed be He pronounces verdict there's no one to retort as is written: "He is one and who will answer him" (Yov 23:13)

Chapter 1166

The Serpent was walking on two and he had semblance slightly similar to that of a man. You should know that those who are able to turn a man into a wolf, a cat or a donkey - his eyeball does not change and so the serpent who underwent a change - his eyes did not change. Therefore one who miscarried and the fetus had a form of a snake - the mother is ritually impure as one who gave birth because his eyeballs are similar to those of a man.

Chapter 1168

A sinning soul will perish and repentance helps but does not fully annul decree but rather pushes off tribulation so that it will not hasten to come and so repentance is effective for soul to bring her to the World to Come
