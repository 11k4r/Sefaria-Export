Ketzot HaChoshen on Shulchan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat



Siman 1



Seif 1

The laws of admission and loans. This is the language of the Tur; "The explanation is that he sues him with witnesses of admission [who testify] that he admitted before them or he borrowed from him before them." See the Taz where he says "Our teacher [the Tur] made sure that you wouldn't make a mistake in explaining according to the other explanation of Rashi on partial admission and complete denial. And experts are needed for something that is a Rabinical ordinance. Therefore he brought the explanation of admission and loans which is not in this path [of thought]".
But to me it seems that since in any case we hold that with regards to swearing of hesit, his property is not forcefully liquidated if he refuses to swear rather he is excommunicated until he swears. Therefore it does not matter with regards to the swearing of hesit, because even by those things which he is not judged on, he is excommunicated for based on the regulation of the two schools. Therefore he [the Tur] brought the explanation of admission, that he is sued with witnesses of admission. Therefore, what the Sm"a says, "And so too is the case where he is sued without witnesses, in the case of the hesit swearing", according to what I wrote, there is no difference with regards to hesit because even with those things that he is not judged he is excommunicated.
