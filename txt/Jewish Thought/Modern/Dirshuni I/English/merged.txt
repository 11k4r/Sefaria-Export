...It was in the Beit Midrash of Bruria that they added: Relationships among women add to their strengths and diminish their sorrows.  ‘To her as a maidservant’ – Zilpah was given to Leah and Bilhah to Rachel….Why did Lavan give Zilpah to his daughter Leah?  Because ‘the eyes of Leah were soft / weak’ (Br 29:17), and tears would flow (zolfot).  Therefore he gave Zilpah [same root] to her, who knew how to contain her tears, and together they could draw the tears to a close.

Who were these companions? They were merely two, and these were they: Rachel, who taught her to cry; and Miriam who taught her timbral and dances. "Rachel taught her to cry" as it is written "Rachel is weeping for her children...for they are gone." (Jeremiah 31:15) and about Bat Yiftach it is said "And weep for my virginity." "Miriam taught her timbral and dances" as it is written "and all the women went out after her in dance with hand-drums" (Exodus 15:20). "All the women" including those who were not in the same generation. And about Bat Yiftach it is said "there was his daughter coming out to meet him, with timbrel and dance!" (Judges 11:34)
