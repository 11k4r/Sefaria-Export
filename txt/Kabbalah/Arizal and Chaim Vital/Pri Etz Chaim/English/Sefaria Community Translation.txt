From Rabbi Chayim Cohen in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak (Ari), may his memory be blessed, who enlightened the eyes of the sages - the order of the arrangement of the Seder plate for the night of Passover: Take the three matzot of <i>shemurah</i> (stringently guarded) matzah and place the [one representing the] priest on top, the [one representing the] Levite below it and the [one representing the] Israelite below it; and these are the three aspects of wisdom, understanding and knowledge (<i>chochmah, binah vedaat</i>)  (in other books, the three minds [<i>mochin</i>]) of the supernal Father. Afterwards take the bitter herbs (<i>marror</i>), the <i>karpas</i>, the shankbone and the egg and place them upon the three matzot - the shankbone which hints to kindness (<i>chesed</i>) on your right, the egg on your left; and the bitter herbs, which hint to harmony, 'extend from end to end' in the middle, between the shankbone and the egg. In other books - because harmony (<i>tiferet</i>) is what mediates between kindness and might (<i>gevurah</i>). And the <i>charoset</i> is on the right, below the shankbone in the right column, corresponding to victory (<i>netzach</i>). And place the <i>karpas</i>, which hints to splendor (<i>hod</i>), below the egg on the left in the left column. And place the horseradish below the bitter herbs in the middle column, to make the sandwich later on, and that corresponds to foundation (<i>yesod</i>). And the plate itself, which includes them all, corresponds to majesty (<i>malkhut</i>).

Gate of Rosh Hashana

Introduction







Chapter 1






When the world was created in Tishrei (Libra) and everything returns to its original condition, there is a need for the sawing [of the unified male-female energy].  The sawing is the following:  it is to give the sawing all the judgment, with mercy only remaining. And the judgment is sweetened with various sweets (that we will explain further below).  The sawing occurs in these ten days.  Each day, one of the attributes are sawed.  It is known that the head of the [female-energy called] Nukvah is back-to-back with his chest and from there and above is the place called Leah, as it is known that his pairing with her happens during these days.  Rachel is not fully sawed (separated) until Yom Kippur and does not couple until Shmini Atzeret.
On the first day of Rosh Hashana, the head of Zeir Anpin (small face) until but not including his Tiferet, the sawings are all taken during these days and it is therefore harsh judgment.  On the second day of Rosh Hashana where the sawing begins on the most elevated section of his Netzach.  This corresponds
