Gate 1



Chapter 1

First palace of seven palaces and which is the hall of Adam Kadmon, and in this palace are seven gates:
The first gate:
Explanation of the round [lights] and direct [lights] including five branches
Regarding the ultimate goal of the creation of the worlds which will now be clarified in two inquiries which the Kabbalists dealt with. The first question is one that was investigated by both early and later Sages, who sought to know the purpose for the creation of the worlds. They discussed, decided, and decreed on the following: Say: That the purpose [for the creation of the worlds] was that the Blessed One had to compelled completeness in all of His deeds and His powers, and all of His names of Gedulah (Greatness), M’alah (Elevation/Highness), and Kavod (Honor).  And had He not brought forth His deeds and His powers, He could not, so to speak have been called complete either in His actions or in His names or in His attributes. Because, behold, the great Divine Name, HaVaYaH, which is [composed] of four letters, is called thus because it expresses His everlasting existence and eternity; that He was, He is, and He will be -before the creation, and afterward when it will revert back to what it was. And if the worlds had not been created, and all that is within them, the true manifestation of His blessed eternal existence -past, present, and future-could not have been seen, for He would not have been called by the name HaVaYaH, as mentioned above.

Chapter 2

Regarding Ein Sof, B"H. What was the beginning of refining of the worlds that are loftier than us? And also a great inquiry and arguments separated all the Mekubalim. For there are those that wrote that the Ten Sefirot are according to ten levels one after the other and one lower than another. And there are those who write that their order is straight up with a border or division between right and left and middle: 3 Sefirot one next to the other on the right side - Chochmah, Chesed, Netzach; 3 Sefirot one next to the other on the left side - Binah, Gevurah, Hod; and 4 Sefirot one next to the other in the middle - Keter, Tiferet, Yesod, Malchut. Many learned and said that they are in the shape/form of wheels, circling around one under the other, and one surrounding another. Behold, one who looks at the words of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in the Zohar and the Tikkunim, and also in the Sefer HaBahir {the Book of Splendor} (written by Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakanah) will find in their words many different lessons which are inclined to here or there. The later Mekubalim {Kabbalists} (who were perplexed by this) greatly tired of investigating this and were not able to do so. Because a great and strong problem/difficulty came upon them like a storm, as was said before, that the Ein Sof differed according to each opinion; and a complete comparison could not be justified either up or down, facing or backwards. All of these established  teachers had boundaries and borders and areas of measuring the Light of the Heavenly Ein Sof, G-d forbid. And it was known that the Light of Ein Sof is fundamental and was embedded within the thickness of each and every Sefirah, and is measured in each and every Sefirah...as is remembered in the Zohar Parshat Behar, and Parshat Pinchas and in the introductions to the Tikkunim...

Chapter 1

Gate fifty, gate ABY"A [Atzilut, Brieya, Yetzira, Asieya] containing ten chapters:

Chapter 2

Know that the physical human body is comprised of four parts, namely, fire wind water and earth, as well as four humors, white red green and black whose primary places are in the lung, liver, gallbladder and spleen for they are the four parts of the animal soul and in that animal soul is clothed kellipat nogah, the mystical secret of the good and evil inclinations. And in this garment of Nogah is clothed that soul of Assiyah, since it does not derive benefit or vitality from the externality called "the Animal Soul" rather through the investiture of the Evil Inclination that gains power in her and dirties her  with the opacity and unholy dross of the animal soul, for she too is comprised of good and evil. Then certainly the soul will ill and transgress, for her sustenance is the evil foods. Yet, when the good inclination gains power over the four elements ie. the animal soul itself then it does not refine but the blood and the finest quality of that animal soul and draws near that soul of Assiyah which is in the liver, and then she is well and does not sin for indeed her four fundamental elements ie. her four Animal-Soul parts are comprised of good and evil. And the evil portion within them are called "the Two Daughters of Lot". It is from that evil portion of the animal soul the evil inclination, alias Sama"e-l, is nourished. Thus, the vessel of the liver is the physical body, in which is the animal soul comprised of good and evil, in which is the good and evil inclinations, which when this (evil) one gains power it draws near the opacity and the evil within it to the primary soul (the Soul) of Assiyah, alias Yaakov, for the Soul of Assiyah is pure, just that she sometimes suckles and is nourished from the good inclination and sometimes from the evil inclination for they are the garments of the Klippat Nogah. Thus, the four fundamental elements are the animal soul and they are doubled - four of good and four of evil - and in the side of good the "Garments of Light (אור)" clothe them, for that is the good within Klippat Nogah. But from the side of evil "Garments of Skin (עור)" - the skin of the serpent - clothes them. We can conclude from this the order of man and the order of nourishment. The physical body of Man is comprised of the four elements, fire water wind and air, as well as four humors, white red green and black whose primary places are in the lung, liver, gallbladder and spleen from where they spread to the entire body and in this body is clothed the Animal Soul. Now the meaning of this is that the whole realm of Assiyah is not an equal plane, for in it are heaven and earth which are not equal. For example, earth is comprised of four elements and the are all inanimate. But there is the the vivifying force of the earth that maintains it and beyond these is the body of the vegetable which is comprised of the four elements and in it is the force that causes its growth. ...
...And it combines with the Inanimate Soul within it, which is higher and greater. However, still being inanimate it has not become nourishment yet, therefore one who foreswears nourishment may still consume water and salt. And afterwards, when eating a vegetable, the Vegetative Soul within it attaches to the 'Vegetative Soul' within man which is higher, and thus it grows, while the body of the vegetable will be expelled as refuse. And so too when Man consumes an animal the refuse is expelled and the Animal Soul that was within it attaches to the "Animal Soul" within Man which is higher and more internal than it and thus it grows. And this is the mystical secret of bodily nourishment, for the Animal Soul within Man is not yet considered 'soul', rather it is 'body'. For the four souls, Inanimate Vegetative Animal and Articulate represent the Four Elements for they are each comprised of the four elements and the complete the body of Man, and are the physical compartment into which spreads the final garment, the spiritual bodies of Assiyah ie. the kellipot. For just as the physical earth serves as the husk and body of the more internal roots of the inanimate, vegetative and animal souls so do the spiritual forms of Assiyah enter first. Understand the order of these levels well. And then from the Kellipat Noga of (the Mystical Secret of the Tree of) good and evil is drawn into the Animal Soul within Man, and within this Kellipat Nogah which is comprised of the Good and Evil Inclinations, is clothed the innermost spiritual level of Assiyah, the soul of them all. This is what is called "The Soul of Man" and "The Soul of Angels". This is the (true) soul (inner life) of the Animal Soul and it is nourished from (the Animal Soul) just as the Animal Soul is nourished from the vegetable etc. However, it is only nourished from the body which is of the Kellipat Noga Good and Evil Inclinations. Thus, the opacity of the Animal Soul within Man which rises towards the Soul of Assiyah is nourished from her and this causes the body to sin. But what caused the opacity in the Animal Soul within Man to begin with? Certainly it is due to the Animal Soul within an actual animal, which is the externality of the Animal Soul within Man. This is why when Man sinned he would bring a sacrifice from among the animal kingdom, for it was they that caused the sin. And the Vegetative and Inanimate Souls are even more opaque than the Animal Soul and they surely contributed to the sin, therefore libations and meal offerings as well as salt accompanied each offering.
