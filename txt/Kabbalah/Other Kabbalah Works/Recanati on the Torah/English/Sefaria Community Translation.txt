Recanati on the Torah

Bereshit



Noach

























  And they said: “Let us build for us a city and a tower” etc. [Genesis 11:4]. The city mentioned is a small city, as you say “and the name of the small one [is] Rachel” [Genesis 29:16)]. And the tower is “a tower of strength is the name of HaShem” (Proverbs 18:10). And this “and his top in heaven [Genesis 11:4] alludes to the uppermost heavens. “And let us make for us a name” [Genesis 11:4]. The one who knows the explanation of “name”, recognizes their evil thought. Because they wanted to separate the Shekinah from the building, and in the separation were the forces of impurity, flowing in her [the Shekinah] from the contamination of the snake, and this is “and let us burn [them] to fire-hardened bricks” [Genesis 11:3]. In the secret of “The house of our holiness and our splendor became a conflagration of fire” (Isaiah 64:10) and in the secret of “because he has made unclean the sanctuary of HaShem” [Numeri 19:20]. “And the brick was for them as stone” [Genesis 11:3]. This secret is known to you in the secret of the Dimensions of the Body [Shi’ur Qomah]. And I cannot explain it. And the stone is the Stone of Foundation, and they were giving a small dimension against a large one. And after they had built the city and the tower according to their shape, they said to make for them a name to be conducted by it, so that they would not be given into the hand of an other leader.

Because today Ad-nai will appear to you. You already know that the Names are sometimes in the masculine and sometimes in the feminine. And so "if You [fem] do this to me" (Numbers 11:15). And they said: feminine and masculine are hints to the characteristic of compassion and the characteristic of judgment. And since the characteristic of judgment receives its emanation [atzilut] from the characteristic of compassion, therefore they called male this compassion, and female this judgment. And she is the shepherdess of the Song of Songs, and the hint - behold, the characteristic of judgment touched Nadav and Avihu, as we explain regarding the decree of El. This is why it is written after "and the Glory/Honor of God appeared to them". There are those who explain this through 'Oh Ad-nai, may You appoint peace for us' (Isaiah 26:12) and the end of the verse proves it: 'You have also requited all our misdeeds' it is a hint to the characteristic of judgment, that separated from sexual transgressions, and so too "if You count transgressions, Yah" (Psalms 130:3), the feminine is hidden, and you know that the Name Yah is a hint to the Shechinah. Our sages said regarding this verse that David said in front of the Holy One of Blessing: Master of the Universe! You give me to an angel that does not show favor! If you keep count of sins, Yah, Ad-nai, who can stand?!' And you know that this characteristic is called angel, and this is what they said regarding the fiery sword that revolves 'some times men, sometimes women' (see Bereshit Rabbah 21:9) therefore our sages z"l called the expression 'shechinah' as feminine. It would be appropriate for the Shechinah to make ten travels 'the Shechinah travel, went up' (Rosh Hashanah 31a) and in the Midrash Mishlei the Shechinah fell in front of the Holy One of Blessing. And the secret of this issue is that even when between the Names there is a distinction between the characteristics of judgment and of compassion, they are all combined and included on each other, as our sages said in the Sefer HaZohar (Zohar 3:30b) There is no crown of all the crowns of the King that does not include both good and evil, and because of that the characteristic of judgment expands onto compassion, or the opposite, because if they were not included on each other it would be impossible for them to switch places, until the first one is cancelled, and then a new creation would be created. This is the knowledge of the masters of Kabbalah and it is right, and I already wrote in a different issue regarding the secret of upsiding connected to Sdom.
