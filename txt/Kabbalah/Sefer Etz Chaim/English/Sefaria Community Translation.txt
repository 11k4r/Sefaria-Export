Sha'ar 1

First palace of seven palaces and which is the hall of Adam Kadmon, and in this palace are seven gates:
The first gate:
Explanation of the round [lights] and direct [lights] including five branches
Regarding the ultimate goal of the creation of the worlds which will now be clarified in two inquiries which the Kabbalists dealt with. The first inquiry is that which the first- and the last ones inquired to know the reason of the creation of the worlds to which reason

Sha'ar 2

(Shorter version from Otzrot Chaim): Know that at the beginning, the entirety of existence, was simple light, what is called Ein Sof (no end). And when it arose in the will of the creator to delegate (their own) nobility, for the known reason, and that is - to be called 'the Merciful and gracious one' 'the One who is slow to anger' etc. Because if there is no one in the world to receive mercy from the divine, how will It be called merciful? and like that with all the other godly nicknames.

Second Palace Called The Palace of Points There are 4 gates
Second Palace Gate One First Chapter
3. Heichal Beit Derushei points: We  will now discuss the world of points these are of the aspect of lights that come through the eyes of Adam Kadmon. We have already explained that there are 4 aspects within them and these are the 4 YHVH Av Sag Ben Mah. and in each level there is cantillations points crowns letters The brain of Adam Kadmon is Ayin Bet. From the ears downward all the way to the feet is Sag. However this idea existed before the end of the kings in the Bounded world and afterwards it was the aspect of Mah and Ben from the place of the belly till lower below the feet as was written. We have already explained that in the name Sag there is cantillations points crowns letters the cantillations  are split into 3 parts which are named Back of the Front However the points are of the aspect of lights that are drawn from his eyes. The idea is that the breath that comes from the opening of the ears is a small air for if a man puts his finger in his ear and holds it there he will here a voice of moving. This is because of the movement of the air that is within and is trying to go out and is unable to. However as soon as he pulls out his finger the sound quiets and we see that from his ears this air comes out as ten sefirot of the aspect of ears as explained above. Afterwards the nose has air that is stronger and comes out from here the ten sefirot of the nose. and afterwards in the mouth there is air more powerful from all of the others because  all the light that goes down is more apparent and powerful and is revealed there and  out from it comes the ten sefirot of Bounded. These are three places of the aspects of cantillations of SAG. Afterwards from the eyes comes out the points of Sag therefore the air from the eyes is not as powerful as the three other openings. Because the light of the small points of points are not as powerful as the cantillations. But with all this we see a small amount of strength in seeing with the eyes as is seen with the senses of the eyes naturally as the idea of bat hayana that is born by the efroach from looking at it for a time unlike other birds that sit on there eggs and hatch it. This proves the apparent power of seeing with the eyes. and behold from this looking of the eyes produces points. From this we understand what is written in Tikkunim #70 That the number 126 that makes up YHVH  from the 4 letters in the form of eyes with their points  In the secret of their back was filled with eyes. The image is shown at the end of this sefer.All the aspects of points eyes to dots When you count from Ayin Bet we see all the  aspects of Bet:
4. All the aspects of eyes are points as we have learned we see that when we count from Ayin Bet all aspects of Ayin Bet are yud from YHVH and sag is the first letter  heh of YHVH and from mah the letter vav and from Ben the last letter heh and when we count the name from the aspect of sag alone the cantillations become of sag the letter yud and the points of the first heh and the letter crowns of the letter vav and the last letter heh and when we divide also the cantillations it becomes also the letter yud of the ear and the first letter heh of the nose and the letter and the letter vav of the mouth and the last letter heh of the  eyes. We see that the eye has in it the aspect of the last letter heh and the first letter heh and this is the secret of what is written in the tikkunim ani yeshena velibi er  according to the last letter heh in the bitul  of the light,of points ani yeshena the secret of sleep I am also yeshena the letters second letters it is chochma which is the first letter heh it is second to keter it is known that the cantillations are keter and the points are chochma and the crowns are bina and the letters are the seven lower Sefirot we find that the eye is of the aspect of chochma that are the points this is the reason that the wise men of the edah are called the wise men of the congregation as is written and it will be if from the eyes of the congregation and in these letters are the aspects of the kings that ruled in the land of Edom and ended as was written before and this is the secret of and the land was tohu and bohu because the land is the last heh that is the aspect of eyes as we learned before and this is the idea of the end of the kings until the coming of their tikkunim as it is said let there be light and there was light and this is open your eyes and see and to understand this pasuk better we explain the foundation of the idea and it is said for behold the points they are nine comprised of kamatz patach tziri segol shevah cholem shorek chirek kibbutz however also there is within them aspects of higher things that are points cholem and emtza like shorek and all the others that are below there place is under the letters and afterwards we will explain all this and we see all the seven after of points are in the form yudin All except the first two points that are kamatz and patach they are two vavin and yud and the idea is when you count all the yudin that are contained within the seven points these are 13 yudin numerically 130 like numerically ayin yud nun to show that from the eyes come out points and leaves kamatz patach that is yud and two vavin and is numerically 22 and it is the secret of the 22 letters and that from them are made vessels of points and if you will say why nirshamu and hinted to are these vessels in the two first points of all of them and the maalot however the idea is that from these two first points that are keter and chochma of the points as is known from them are made vessels elected hashar and these,that come out from them vessels to the sefirot beneath them another reason it is known that the second lower points are the seven kings that ended but the first three kings didn't and it is known the aspect of ending is breaking of the vessels therefore the seven latter points were left without vessels and only light that is the aspects of points but the firsts that didn't end  and were left with their vessels we see the lights are hidden and enclothed within the vessels and are called after the vessels that are 22 letters hinting to kamatz and patach and we see the kamatz oversees the keter as is known and the keter is the cantillations and the patach oversees chochma and these are the points therefore they are called the two points these kamatz and patach these oversee the ideas we mentioned above. And it is that all the time yet to come out are only the cantillations of sag that are the aspects of the lights of achor panim and yet the  lights are closed and kamutzim. And when it comes to the aspects of the points that are chochma that is patach and it is the. aspect of ayin as we learned then is opened in the opening of the eyes as is mentioned in tikkunim and this relates points of patach but firstly in the aspects of cantillations that are Keter its kamatz because the lights are kamutzim and closed. We return to the subject of the pasuk open your eyes and see because when we come to the aspect of ayin that are the points then we say open your eyes for then we have the opening of the lights. And we see already explained all these aspects they are in the name of sag and this name hints to bina that is upper gevurah that on them relies the justices therefore in this aspect of sag  is the idea  of bitul of the kings also in particular sag itself contains within it the aspects of cantillations that they are also called av while being in sag But the points of sag are the very essence of sag itself they are sag of sag there they are bitul and that which is written they are all sag together for in the name of sag is all the bitul and sag itself oversees on that which is written that it is in language of turned back which is the nullifications of the kings and also the eye is that which is called also for sag like the achor panim as written above and that is the idea for is it not the 3 aspects that is the achor panim that are the cantillations it is the name sag of them the aspect of yhvh that is sag yud hy vav hy: 
5.however in eye which is the aspect of points that is sag of 3 times ehyeh that is numerically 63 also and this is the sag that is the eye and we see all ehyeh from these three is taken all aspects of 22 letters hinted to in the kamatz patach in order to make with them vessels by way of looking with the eye and if so all the names of ehyeh of them include all the aspects of 22 we find 3 names ehyeh with three times 22 letters with it itself included comes up to 130 numerically 130 ayin how is the name of sag hinted to also in eye and this is open your eyes and see because in achor panim there is 3 times sag numerically open with itself included and after them comes the aspects of eyes and this is open your eyes for these three ehyeh are in the eyes they are in the aspect of ehyeh of crowns numerically 161 in the order of eyes with itself included and this for there was a great and bitul of the kings:
6. MB already we learned above in the anaf of 4 gates of derushei circles and straightness for these lights explained above that comes out from achor panim of Adam kadmon don't include the aspect of igul and straightness but they are all straightness only but the aspect of the forehead and the eye of this man that is the secret of these points has within them the aspect of circles and straightness example of Adam kadmon and come out from nhy and half of tiferet of this Adam kadmon and below from the aspect of straightness and there come out first circles of points and these surround and cover nhy and half of tiferet of Adam kadmon that is the secret of straightness and surrounds it this straightness and is between it and we see already that there is an inner light and an outer light in this Adam Kadmon and all are in the secret of straightness and we see these circles of points cause a stop between the surrounding light of this straightness and between the. Inner light of the vessels of this man from all sides and afterwards the surrounding of these lights the surrounding of this straightness of this man surrounds and covers all the circles of points and within these circles there you have the straightness of nekudim within. Them is the example of the straightness of Adam Kadmon within them however there is one difference and it is that these circles that cover netzach hod yesod and half of tiferet of Adam kadmon don't cover them from two sides because the source of the light was on the side of image of this Adam Kadmon of straightness of itself but from this lighting spreads out beyond it also between the aspect of straightness and the aspect of circles of points we find that nhy and half tiferet of this Adam Kadmon enclothes and covers from these points between from the aspect of circles of it and between the aspect of straightness of them and Adam Kadmon is between them however this that we mentioned that there is in points the aspect of circles and the aspect of straightness it was not like this from the beginning until the beginning of atzilut the points emanated in the aspect of circles of them alone without straightness and these are the aspects of nefesh of nekudim as was written therefore there breaking came about because only the aspect of nefesh came out they are circles and are not able to receive upper light therefore came about all the aspects of end of the kings and there bitul as explained in entirety in the pereks this is the secret of the pasuk that Elohim made man straight and they requested many understandings because Adam kadmon was there in the aspect of straightness and this is he made man straight and these that are the nekudim sought many explanations that are the circles and weren't made with them the aspect of straightness therefore broke and ended and afterwards it is explained how they sought many explanations that are the aspects of  and why the points went out as circles moreso than the lights of back to front for all of them only went out in the way of straightness and the tikkun of kings that died was by bringing out their ruach and the Chaya that is the secret man was male and female didn't count only in straightness and then he was male and female exactly also man that is the name of mah numerically Adam and he came in straightness and came out from the lights of the forehead also understand how this name of mah and it is in ZA and in yetzira that is the aspect of ruach this is the ruach of points:
7. I am unsure if I heard from my Rabbi if the name sag are the kings that died mentioned previously They are the circles and afterwards the name mah comes afterwards alone and from it straightness is made and the name of sag is left to circles or from the name sag are rectified first the circles and afterwards in the tikkun the straightness comes out of sag and from the name mah the straightness alone and the straightness of sag is included with the straightness  of mah as explained next to us that it is the secret of Atik and its female the name mah and ben or if we say that from the name sag comes out first circles and then at the time of the tikun of the circles and afterwards at the time of the tikkun of the circles and the straightness of sag comes out and also from the name mah circles and straightness comes out and connects circles with circles and straightness in straightness:
8. And we explain now the reason why points circles moreso than other lights of back to face. And the idea is know that the light of the eyes are not similar to other lights because the eye when man in one ruach and one side they are able to notice all their needs and to move their seeing with their eye only they dont move their body and head at all but they move their eyes and look to the sides moreso then lights like the lights of back to face whos air comes out bemishor therefore the lights that come out with straightness are made in the aspect of straightness but the nikkudim that come out from the aspect of eyes they spread out around Adam Kadmon by way of circles a second reason since the upper lights come out by way of tube of the mouth or nose or ears therefore they are left straight moreso in the points of air that comes out from nhy of Adam Kadmon it splits into vessels of Adam Kadmon and exits out in the secret of and after oori nakfu zot that the light is inside and nokef and strikes the skin and goes out from all sides the entire man and if the stomach was open and the light came out from there to the nikudim the points would be in straightness according to the light of the stomach and kilucho in straightness but this light comes out from all sides of the skin by way of gumot and hairs that is on the skin therefore the points are circles third reason and we explain also the second reason better. And it is didnt we explain in another place the idea of the 2nd tzimtzum of Adam Kadmon because in order to emanate these points we need to restrict the lights of nhy and half of tiferet above and it is called the first curtain created in the place of the stomach and this light that was there first comes out by way of the eyes and from there it goes out and descends downwards towards nhy of Adam Kadmon from outside and there nithavu the points and when this light rises up it goes by way of mayin nukvin and a new light comes out and descends by way of the inner of this man and goes down by way of curtain and goes down to nhy of this man and splits this new inner light from there and goes out the way of the skin and from there it lights to the points and afterwards oori nikafu zot in the 2nd reason we find that these points are made by these two lights points are made through the 2 lights the light goes out and it is the first light and through the inner light which is new and splits and goes out and behold this inner light goes And it is the first light and through the inner light which is new and splits and goes out and behold this inner light goes out from all sides beyond the skin and therefore circles are Made as mentioned in the second reason there is also another reason that since the first light was in the place of the chest and there its source remains to lighten outwards and when the new light descends it meets together the three lights the light of adam kadmon itself from the aspect of its tiferet and also the first light that comes up from nhy and a new light and therefore they press together hard alot and specifically when it goes over and goes to enlighten nhy it needs to strongly split this spreading and go over and descend therefore from this strength of these aspects that it splits and goes out from the skin to lighten these points it goes out with heavy strength and is made into an circle the third reason is because the first light has great pressure because it comes from the eyes it goes out strongly from the eyes and it comes from the eyes. It goes out strongly from the eyes and made a circle However the inner light that spreads from all sides it desires to attach all the tubes by lights this from this and hit it strongly as we learned therefore the tubes of circles of lights by tubes coming out in the aspect of face and surround and touches with the tubes that come out from behind and connect and the round light from this we understand how the eyes hints to netzach. Hod because the light of netzach and hod of this Adam Kadmon goes out from the eyes therefore netzach and hod hints to the eyes
9. Ayin Beit  of adam kadmon is in the head afterwards sag comes and begins from The back front and all these three divisions are cantillations and they are Ayin Beit of sag and in the aspect of gevurah that is the mouth is called bounded afterwards sag comes and begins from the back front and all these three divisions are cantillations and they are Ayin Beit of sag and in the aspect of Gevurah that is the mouth are called bounded afterwards sag of sag comes and it is points beginning from The eyes of Adam Kadmon and are the 9 points 5 kings 4 servants as is known 2 upper points that are kamatz and patach that are Keter Chochma that didnt end and the seven others ended and here we have a question that we said that two first points alone are held firm in another place it is written that the first three points that didnt end are Keter Chochma Bina and the seven others that are the six points left from the nine and malchut that rules without a point as is known these 7 died its possible to explain and say that since the face of Abba and Imma didnt die They are called one point in the secret of Yud That are the letters yud heh understand with wisdom and therefore it is all called chochma alone and the leftovers that fell from Abba and Imma They are heh in the name of secret and hochma in Bina and they are all called binah alone that is the secret of the leftovers to the face that is Zachar Chochma we find the points of patach are the two faces of Abba and Imma they are all called Chochma and the points of tziri they are the two leftovers of them that are called binah and through this we justify two aspects mentioned before because in tsiri also there is an ending which is the composite of the leftovers also right is what is written that also binah didnt end and it is in the secret of its face and its possible that the face are Hochma and Binah and the leftovers are Yisrael Saba and Tevunah in the secret of Yaakov and Leah that are the leftovers of them
