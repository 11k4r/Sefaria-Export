Sefer HaBahir

Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKana said: 
One verse ( Job 37:21 ) states, "And now they do not see light, it is brilliant (Bahir) in the 
skies... [round about God in terrible majesty]." 
Another verse, however, (Psalm 18:12), states, "He made darkness His hiding place." It is 
also written (Psalm 97:2), "Cloud and gloom surround Him." This is an apparent 
contradiction. 
A third verse comes and reconciles the two. It is written (Psalm 139:12), "Even darkness is 
not dark to You. Night shines l ik e day — light and darkness are the same."
