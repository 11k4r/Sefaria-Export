... Y’ י is the head of the bird. V’ ו is his body. H”H ה ה are the two wings, through which he flies upward and comes to rest below. And these two wings are two breaths, H”H, and concerning them it is said, “And the animals/chayot [bearing the divine chariot] ran and returned” [Ez 1:14], for these are Y”V: a breath leaves through Y’ י – a breath returns through V’

“Let us make a human”—this is the command to circumcise the convert to become “in our image” through the cutting of the foreskin, “as our likeness” through tearing back [the foreskin], and if they freed the sign of the covenant through these two [actions] then he is “in our image as our likeness”, and if not, not.

‘Let us make Adam/ a human’—to whom did the Cause of causes say this to? The Cause of causes said [it] to none other than YudHe’ Va’v He’, which is [drawn] from out of ten Sefirot.”
... The ten s’firot . . . are clothed in ten things that were created on the first day, and these are: heavens and earth, light and darkness, abyss and chaos, wind and water, the measure of day and the measure of night.

Daf 122a




“This/Zeh is the book of the generations of Adam”. “ZH” (7 + 5) literally/vad’ay, comprising the twelve constellations of Adam that is above / Adam dil`eyla, about which it says concerning them, “tribes of Yah, testimonies of Israel” [Ps 122:4]. “Zeh” literally are the four faces of the lion, four faces of the ox, four faces of the eagle, that in them are recognized the faces/par’tsufin of human beings. And all of these faces are impressed in the four letters of YHV”H ... This is the Shekhinah that is called “the human likeness / d’mut Adam” [Ez 1:5], for every likeness/dimyon and face/par’tsuf of human beings are recognized in her, and every form above and below; and because of her it is said, “and through the hand of (by) the prophets I will be imaged /adameh” [Ho 12:11].

"<i>Bereshit</i>, in the beginning" (Genesis 1:1). This includes two fires ("<i>trei esh</i>"), which are the two flames [referred to in the blessing] "Blessed is the Creator of the lights of fire". And in this regard it is written (Song of Songs 2:5) "Sustain me with cakes (<i>ashishot</i>)", that is, with two fires (<i>eishot</i>). Why is 'sustain me' said in this context? This refers to the eves of the Shabbat, when an additional soul descends in order to support the lower <i>Shechina</i> in exile, of whom it is said (Amos 5:2) "Fallen, not to rise again [is the maiden of Israel.]" When Shabbat reaches its end, this additional soul leaves, of which it is written (Exodus 31:17) "[God was] refreshed (<i>vayinafash</i>)". [This is the meaning of ] <i>vayinafash</i>? As soon as it leaves, woe to the soul! (<i>vay nefesh!</i>), for nobody is left to support her. In such moments, she cries out to Israel "Support me with <i>ashishot</i>", that is, with lights of fires. What are these fires? Two Torahs, carved of fire, which are ELOHIM, the aspect of might. These are known as (Isaiah 54:13) "Teachings of the Lord," two lips of burning flames, or two apples out of which the spirit of the Messiah comes, of which is said (Isaiah 11:2) "The spirit of the Lord shall alight on him."
[This can be compared] to a princess confined in sickness because of her love for her husband. When her husband left she fell to her bed, crying out and saying "Support me with cakes,<i>ashishot</i>)". So too, she [the <i>Shechina</i>] is confined in sickness, and says (Song of Songs 2:5) "Refresh me..." With what? "...with apples," which flourish in the trees of the forest - and these are the fragrant plants.
The third elder rose and said: Rabbi! Rabbi! Behold, we do the <i>Havdalah</i> ceremony with [all sorts of] fragrant plants, even though she specifically spoke about apples. Rather, we use fragrant plants, of which it is said (Song of Songs 7:9) "Your breath is like the fragrance of apples." Moreover, all sorts of fragrant plants are fit for [these Havdalah] blessings. [In fact,] we use myrtle branches, because they have [sets of] three leaves, known as the 'three <i>hadassim</i>', which hint at the three forefathers. The two nostrils [smelling the fragrance], however, represent the two apples, the two true prophets, from whom the holy spirit - the faithful shepherd - is destined to issue. Thus it is written (Song of Songs 2:5) "Refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love."

Daf 145b

On the eve of Shabbat, it is said (Song of Songs 5:5) "I rose to let in my beloved" - on Shabbat! And when Shabbat departs, it is said (Song of Songs 5:6) "My beloved turned and was gone..." At that time, "... I sought, but found him not; I called, but he did not answer." Until I swear that the next time He comes, I will clutch his hand and not let it go, as it says (Song of Songs 3:4) "I held him fast, I would not let him go, until I brought him to my mother's house, to the chamber of she who conceived me" - that is, the third temple.

Daf 146a







When the groom, that is, the sun, comes to light up the moon, she decorates her hair with thirteen decorations - twelve constellations and the moon. And He (Psalms 19:6) "is like a groom coming forth from his chamber; like a hero, eager (<i>yasis</i>) to run," - to run his courses in the heavens. He surely peeks (<i>yatsits</i>) at her, as it says (Song of Songs 2:9) "Peeking through the lattice." - looking at her in the heavens. 

Daf 146b

that is [the meaning of] <i>yasis</i>. But what is the meaning of 'hero'? What heroism is in this? Rather, there are twelve windows in the heavens, [filled with] warriors adverse to Him guarding the gates. [Then,] the sun wraps himself in the letters of the tefillin, and dresses himself in might, as it is written (Isaiah 42:13): "The Lord goes forth as a hero." Thus he goes out "eager like a hero running his course", opening up all the windows of the heavens and creating twelve paths - just as Moses did in the [Red] Sea. Surely, He "runs his course", and since at first He took on [His aspect of] might, the [colour of the rising] sun is red. 
After this, He dresses in the aspect of loving-kindness, in white, and thus the anger of the sun is tempered. Green extends out of the central pillar, and when He dresses in loving-kindness, in white light, He [is able to] light up the moon.  And (Psalms 19:7) "His rising-place is at one end of heaven..." - that is the central pillar. One of its ends is [known as] 'the Righteous', and "...his circuit reaches the others..." - the two pillars of truth. In these, "nothing escapes his heat." - this refers to the upper <i>Shechinah</i>, who is the Heat. From there, He is coloured in shades of green, that is, mercy. At this time, the sun and the moon look at each other, "nothing escapes his heat", since she [the upper <i>Shechinah</i>] is the canopy of her [the lower <i>Shechinah</i>].
At that time, She is robed in three colours, flaunting Herself before Him with the three colours of Her eyes: white, red and green. At that time, He will say of Her (Song of Songs 6:5): "Turn your eyes away from me, for they overwhelm me!" - they burn me with their flames of your love! [Then Elijah exclaimed:] Sacred Lamp! (Rabbi Shimon), these two eyes are the two precious tablets of Torah, of which it is said (Exodus 31:18): "stone tablets inscribed with the finger of God." They are written on both sides, coloured with twelve shades on this side and twelve shades on the other. These are the twenty-four sides, and it is written (Exodus 32:15) "they were inscribed on one side (<i>zeh</i>) and the other side (<i>zeh</i>)."  <i>Zeh</i> is written twice, [and its numerical value (12) doubled is like] the twenty-four books of the Tanach.

Daf 147a



Daf 147b


And the hands of the matronita, are all of Her holy. All of them are tracings in (of) the name YHVH, like this: in the palm Y י, in the five fingers H ה, in Her arm V ו and in Her shoulder H ה. In Her palm are formed so many lines, like branches of the Tree of Life . . . That is what’s written: “A tree of life she is for the ones holding her (i.e. the arms) and her supporters are happy” [Pr 3:18].
V is the written Torah, which is given in two arms . . . and with them the two tablets are given, which are “two breasts” [So 4:5]. And these are YY ײ, (i.e., two dots, perhaps the areolae or nipples), and in (i.e., between) them is the form of a Zayin, and in (between) them it is narrow/tsar. That is why it’s written: “And [God] formed/Vayyitsar/ VYYTsR [the human]” [Gn 2:7], and they are the virginity-signs/b’tulim of the maiden [which signify] the Torah by mouth (oral Torah).
The praise of the body / sh’vacha d’gufa: “This qomah of yours is likened to a date palm / zo’t qomateikh damtah l’tamar” [So 7:8]. And one that knows the measure of Her stature/body / shi`ur qomah dilah (symbolized by the upright palm) will inherit the world that is coming. . . about which it says: “Israel’s purifying pool / miqveh Yisra’el is YHVH” [Je 17:13]—miqveh/MQVH מקוה , which is Her body/qomah/QVMH קומה , Her shi`ur. Sh`iur qomah – this is the Righteous One /Tsadiq, about whom it says: “Tsadiq like a date palm will bloom” [Ps 92:13]
For it says about her/Her: “And they came Elim-ward, and there [were] twelve springs of water and seventy date palms” [Ex 15:27]. “Twelve springs”—these are twelve joints/sections, which are: six in the arms (right and left shoulder, elbow, and wrist, or upper arm, lower arm, and hand) and six in two legs/shoqin (right and left hip, knee, and ankle, etc.). That is what’s written: “His hands [are] rolls of gold filled in Tarshish (or: with beryl)” [So 5:14]. What is “in Tarshish ( תרשיש )”? “In two, six / t’rey shesh ( תרי שש )”—in two arms [are] six joints; and so [are there] six/shesh others in two legs, [as it says:] “His [two] thighs are pillars of marble/shesh ( שש )” [So 5:15]. These are twelve springs.
