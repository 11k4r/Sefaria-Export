Tikkunim Mizohar Chadash

Three people are especially beloved by G-d: One who does not lose control of his temper, one who does not become drunk, and one who does not demand his full rights.  (Pesachim 113a)
One who carefully guards himself against giving in to anger and avoids any arguments, merits that his home is compared to the holy Temple. (Zohar)
