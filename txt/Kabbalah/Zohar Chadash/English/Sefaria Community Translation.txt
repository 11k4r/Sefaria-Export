And it is written: 'And Eliyahu went up to heaven in a whirlwind.' (II Kings 2:11). Rabbi Nechemiah and Rabbi Yehudah say: 'when the Holy Blessed One brought Eliyahu to heaven the Angel of Death stood to oppose Him. 
The Holy Blessed One said to him [the angel]: This is why I created the heaven, so Eliyahu could go there!' The Angel of Death said to the Master of the World: 'Now You have given other creatures an opening [to avoid death]." The Holy Blessed One replied: 'Eliyahu is not like other creatures. He could remove you [Death] from the world and you do not know his strength.' The Angel of Death said, 'Master of the World, grant me permission and I will descend upon him.' He said 'Go down.' And he immediately descended. But Eliyahu saw him, forced him under his leg, and [Eliyahu] asked to be able to remove him from the world, but God did not grant him permission. Immediately, Eliyahu flipped him and ascended [alive] to heaven.

Midrash HaNe'elam Al Eichah



Tikkunim Mizohar Chadash

Three people are especially beloved by G-d: One who does not lose control of his temper, one who does not become drunk, and one who does not demand his full rights.  (Pesachim 113a)
One who carefully guards himself against giving in to anger and avoids any arguments, merits that his home is compared to the holy Temple. (Zohar)
