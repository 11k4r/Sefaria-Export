﻿precious stones to crown him with; she brought forth silken garments and clad him therewith and adorned him royally. 
Then she went to the bride and saw how her maidens were arranging her crown and her garments and her jewels. She said to them: I have prepared a bath with flowing water perfumed with all manner of sweet scents to purify my daughter-in-law. Let my daughter-in-law, the lady of my son, come with all her maidens that they may purify themselves in the place of flowing water which I have prepared for them, and then they can robe her with all her ornaments. To-morrow when my son comes to wed the lady he will prepare a palace for all and his abode shall be among you. 
So it is with the Holy King and the Matronita and the Hevraya, whose dwelling shall thus be together inseparably. as it is written, 'Lord, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle?... He that walketh uprightly and effects righteousness' (Ps.15:1-2); these are those who array the Matronita in her jewels, her raiment and her crowns. Each of them called 'poel tzedek'.
