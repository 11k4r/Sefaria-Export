Weekday

Shacharit

Preparatory Prayers

Modeh Ani

1. I gratefully thank You, O living and eternal King, for you have returned my soul within me with compassion-abundant is  your faithfulness!
2. The beginning of wisdom is the fear of HASHEM- good understanding to all who practice them; His praise endures forever. Blessed is the Name of His glorious kingdom for all eternity.

Netilat Yadayim

1. Blessed are You, HASHEM, our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us regarding washing the hands.

Asher Yatzar

Blessed are You, HASHEM, our God, King of the universe, Who fashioned man with wisdom and created him many openings and many cavities. It is obvious and known before Your Throne of Glory that if but one of them were to be ruptured or but one of them were to be blocked, it would be impossible to survive and to stand before You. Blessed are You, HASHEM, Who heals all flesh and acts wondrously.

Elokai Neshama

My God the soul You placed within me is pure. You created it, You fashioned it, You breathed it into me, You safeguard it within me, and eventually You will take it from me in Time to Come. As long as the soul is within me, I gratefully thank you, HASHEM, my God and the God of my forefathers, Master of all works, Lord of all souls, Blessed are You, HASHEM, Who restores souls to dead bodies.

Tzitzit

Blessed are You, HASHEM, our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has commanded us regarding the commandment of tzitzis.
2. May it be Your will, HASHEM my God and the God of my forefathers, that the commandment of tiztis be as worthy before You as if I had fulfilled it in all its details, implications, and intentions, as well as the six hundred and thirteen commandments that are dependent upon it, Amen, Selah!

Torah Blessings

1. Blessed are You, HASHEM, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and has commanded us to engross ourselves in words of Torah.
2. Please, HASHEM, our God, sweeten the words of Your Torah in our mouth and in the mouth of Your people, the House of Israel.May we and our offspring and the offspring of Your people, the House of Israel -all of us- know your Name and study Your Torah for its own sake. Blessed are You, HASHEM, Who teaches Torah to His people Israel.
3. Blessed are You, HASHEM, our God, King of the universe, who selected us from all the nations and gave us His Torah. Blessed are You, HASHEM, Giver of the Torah.
