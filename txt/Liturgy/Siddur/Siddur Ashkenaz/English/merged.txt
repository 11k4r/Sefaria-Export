Preparatory Prayers

Modeh Ani

I offer thanks to You, living and eternal King, for You have mercifully restored my soul within me; Your faithfulness is great.

Netilat Yadayim

Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with Your commandments, and command us concerning the washing of the hands.

Asher Yatzar

Praised are You, Lord our God King of the universe, who with wisdom fashioned the human body, creating openings, arteries, glands and organs, marvelous in structure, intricate in design. Should but one of them, by being blocked or opened, fail to function, it would be impossible to exist. Praised are you, Lord, healer of all flesh who sustains our bodies in wondrous ways.

Elokai Neshama

My God, the soul which you have placed within me is pure. You have created it; You have formed it; You have breathed it into me. You preserve it within me; You will take it from me, and restore it to me in the hereafter. So long as the soul is within me, I offer thanks before You, Lord my God and God of my fathers, Master of all creatures, Lord of all souls. Blessed are You, Lord, who restores souls to the dead.

And may we and our offspring [and the offspring of our offspring] and the offspring of Your people, the House of Israel - all of us - be knowing of Your Name and studying Your Torah for its sake. Blessed are You, Lord, Who teaches Torah to His people, Israel.
Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who has chosen us from all of the nations and given us His Torah. Blessed are You, Lord, Who gives the Torah.

Torah Study



Tallit






Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with Your commandments, and commanded us to wrap ourselves in the tzitzit.
How precious is Your kindness, O God! The children of men take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
They have their fill of the choice food of Your house, and you give them drink of Your stream of delights.
For with You is the fountain of life; by Your light do we see light.
Continue Your kindness to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.

Tefillin

By putting on tefillin, I intend to fulfill the command of my Creator, who has commanded us to wear tefillin, as it is written in the Torah: You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. The tefillin contain four sections of the Torah which proclaim the absolute unity of God, blessed be His name, and remind us of the miracles and wonders which he did for us when he brought us out from Egypt, he who has the power and the dominion over the heavenly and earthly creatures to deal with them as he pleases.
He has commanded us to wear tefillin on the arm in memory of His outstretched arm; opposite the heart, to intimate that we ought to subject our heart's desires and designs to the service of God, blessed be He; and on the head opposite the brain, to intimate that the mind which is in the brain, and all senses and faculties, ought to be subjected to His service, blessed be He.
May my observance of the tefillin precept bring me long life, holy inspiration and sacred thoughts, and free me from any sinful reflection whatever. May the evil impulse never tempt us, but leave us to serve the Lord as our heart desires. ...


Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with Your commandments, and commanded us to wear tefillin.


Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with Your commandments, and commanded us concerning the precept of tefillin.


Blessed be the name of his glorious majesty for all time.
Supreme God, imbue me with Your wisdom and Your intelligence; in Your grace, do great things for me; in Your might, cut off my foes and adversaries. Pour the good oil into the seven branches of the menorah to bestow Your goodness upon Your creatures. You open Your hand, and satisfy every living thing with favor.


I betroth you to myself forever.
I betroth you to myself in righteousness and in justice, in kindness and in mercy.
I betroth you to myself in faithfulness, and you shall know the Lord.


The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
Consecrate all the first-born to me, whatever is first-born in Israel, of man or of beast, for it belongs to me.
Moses said to the people: Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of a house of slavery; for by a strong hand the Lord brought you out of this place; no leavened bread shall be eaten.
This day you are leaving, in the month of Aviv.
And when the Lord will bring you into the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivvite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers He would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, then you shall perform this service in this month.
For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival in honor of the Lord.
Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen in your possession, nor any leaven, anywhere in your territory.
And you shall tell your son on that day, saying: This is on account of what the Lord did for me when I left Egypt.
It shall serve as a sign on your hand, and as frontlets between your eyes, so that the Lord's teaching may be ever in your mouth; for by a strong hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt.
You shall observe this ordinance at its proper time from year to year.
And when the Lord will bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and to your fathers, and will give it to you;
You shall make over to the Lord whatever is first-born; all the firstlings of the young animals that you will have, the males, shall be the Lord's.
Every firstling ass, however, you shall redeem with a lamb; but if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every first-born son of yours you shall redeem.
And when your son asks you in time to come: What does this mean? You shall tell him: By a strong hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of a house of slavery.
And when Pharaoh made difficulties about letting us go, the Lord slew every first-born in the land of Egypt, the first-born of both man and beast; that is why I sacrifice to the Lord every first-born male animal, but I redeem all my first-born sons.
This shall serve as a sign on your hand, and as frontlets between your eyes; for the Lord brought you out of Egypt by a strong hand.

Ma Tovu

How goodly are your tents, O Jacob, your habitations, O Israel!
By Your abundant grace, I enter Your house.
I worship before Your holy shrine with reverence.
O Lord, I love Your abode, the place where Your glory dwells.
I will worship and bow down; I will bend the knee before the Lord my Maker.
I offer prayer to You, O Lord, at a time of grace.
O God, in Your abundant kindness, answer me with Your saving truth.

Adon Olam

The king of the world, who ruled before any creature was created. At the time they were made, all was according to His will, and then His name was called "King". And after everything was finished, he alone ruled, awe-inspiring. He was, He is, and He will be with splendor. And, he was first, with no second, to rule over him or to collaborate; with no beginning and no end, he has the strength and the right. And he is my G-d, my redeemer is alive; the rock who sustains me in a distressful day. And he is my banner and refuge, the portion of my cup on the day I call out. In his hand, I safeguard my spirit, [for] when I sleep, [I know that] I will wake. And with my spirit is my body; G-d is for me, and I will not be afraid. 

Yigdal

May the living G-d be exalted, and praised, it is found that there is no specific time to find him [for he is eternal]. He is one, and there is none as unified as his unity; it is hidden, and there is also no end to his unity. He has no bodily form, and no body; his holiness has not been ordered for him. He is earlier than anything which he created, [He is] the first and there is none before His earliness. He is surely the lord of the world, to all being, and He teaches his greatness and kingship. An abundance of prophecy He gave to them, his special and splendorous people. There never again arose in Israel like Moses, a prophet and seer of His image. A truthful instruction, G-d gave to His people, by the hand of his prophet who was trustworthy in His house. The G-d will not change, nor will he switch His belief, forever [there is none] except for Him. He watches and knows our secrets, and looks at the end of something at its beginning. He recompensates people with kindness, according to their deeds, and gives the wicked bad according to his evil. At the end of days, He will send our annointed, to redeem those who wait for the end [when] His salvation [takes place]. The dead will G-d resuscitate, in his abundant kindness, blessed be His praised name forever.

And may it be pleasing before You, Hashem our G-d and the G-d of our forefathers, that you make us accustomed in your Torah, and make us stick to your commandments. And that You do not bring us not to the hands of sin, nor to the hands of transgression and wrongdoing, nor to the hands of trial, and nor to the hands of scorn. And let not the evil inclination rule inside us, and distance us from a bad person and a bad friend. And stick us to the good inclination and to good deeds, and force our inclination to be subdued to You. And grant us today and every day grace and kindness and mercy, in your eyes an in the eyes of all who see us, and reward us with good kindnesses. Blessed are You, Hashem, who rewards good kindnesses upon His nation, Israel. 
May it be pleasing before You, Hashem my G-d and the G-d of my forefathers, that save us today and every day from those who are arrogant and from arrogance itself, from a bad person, a bad friend, a bad neighbor, a bad strike, from the destructive Satan, from a harsh law and from a harsh judge, whether he is a son of the covenant or whether he is not a son of the covenant.

Akedah

And it came to pass after these things that God put Abraham to the test, and said to him: "Abraham"; and he answered: "Here I am." Then he said: "Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love; go to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains that I will tell you." So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took with him his two servants and his son Isaac; he cut wood for the burnt-offering and started for the place about which God had told him. On the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place at a distance. Then Abraham said to his servants: "You stay here with the ass while I and the boy go yonder: we will worship and come back to you." So Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on his son Isaac, while he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and the two of them went off together. Then Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said: "My father"; and he answered: "Here I am, my son." And he said: "Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?" Abraham answered: "God will provide himself with the lamb for a burnt offering, my son." So the two of them went on together. They came to a place which God had told him, and Abraham built the altar there, arrange the wood, bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood. Then Abraham put out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from the heavens: "Abraham, Abraham," and he answered: "Here I am." He said: "Do not lay your hand on the boy, and do nothing to him; for I know now that you revere God, seeing that you have not refused me your son, your only son." Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; so Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it as a burnt-offering instead of his son. Abraham called the name of that place Adonai-yireh, as it is said to this day: "The mount where the Lord reveals himself." The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from the heavens, and said: "By myself I swear," says the Lord, "that since you have done this, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, I will indeed bless you, and will surely make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky or as the sands on the seashore; your descendants shall possess the cities of their enemies, and through your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed—because you have obeyed my voice." Abraham then returned to his servants, and they started together for Beersheba, for Abraham dwelt in Beersheba.
Master of the world! May it be Your will, Lord our God and God of our fathers, to remember in our favor the covenant of our fathers. Even as Abraham our father held back his compassion from his only son and desired to slay him in order to do Your will, so may Your mercy hold back Your anger from us; let Your compassion prevail over Your acts of retaliation. Be lenient with us, Lord our God, and deal with us kindly and mercifully. In Your great goodness, may Your fierce wrath turn away from Your people, Your city, Your land, and Your heritage. Fulfill, Lord our God, what You promised us through Moses Your servant, as it is said: "I will remember my covenant with Jacob; also my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land."

Introductory Psalm

A psalm, a song for the dedication of the house; by David. I extol You, O Lord, for You have lifted me, and have not let my foes rejoice over me. Lord my God, I cried to You, and You did heal me. O Lord, You have lifted me up from the grave; You have let me live, that I should not go down to the pit. Sing to the Lord, you who are godly, and give thanks to his holy name. For his anger only lasts a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may lodge with us at evening, but in the morning there are shouts of joy. I thought in my security I would never be shaken. O Lord, by Your favor You established my mountain as stronghold; but when Your favor was withdrawn, I was dismayed. To You, O Lord, I called; I appealed to my God: "What profit would my blood be, if I went down to the grave? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness? Hear, O Lord, and be gracious to me; Lord, be my helper." You have changed my mourning into dancing; You have put off my sackcloth and girded me with joy; so that my soul may praise You, and not be silent. Lord my God, I will thank You forever.

Kaddish Yatom

Glorified and sanctified by God's great name—throughout the world which He has created according to His will. May He establish His kingdom in your lifetime and during your days, and within the life of the entire house of Israel, speedily and soon; and say Amen.
May His great name be blessed forever and to all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified and exalted, extolled and honored, adored and lauded by the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.
Beyond all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations that are ever spoken in the world; and say Amen. May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life, for us and for all Israel; and say Amen. He who creates peace in his celestial heights, may he create peace for us and all Israel; and say Amen.

Baruch SheAmar

Blessed be He who spoke, and the world came into being; blessed be He. Blessed be He who created the universe. Blessed be He who says and performs. Blessed be He who decrees and fulfills. Blessed be He who has mercy on the world. Blessed be He who has mercy on all creatures. Blessed be He who grants a fair reward to those who revere him. Blessed be He who lives forever and exists eternally. Blessed be He who redeems and saves; blessed be His name. Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, O God, merciful Father, who are praised by the mouth of Your people, lauded and glorified by the tongue of Your faithful servants. With the songs of Your servant David will we praise You, Lord our God; with his hymns and psalms we exalt, extol, and glorify You. We will call upon Your name and proclaim You King, our King, our God. You who are One, the life of the universe, O King, praised and glorified be Your great name for all time. Blessed are You, Lord, King extolled with hymns of praise.

Hodu



Psalm 100



Y'hi Chavod (18 verses)

May the glory of the Lord be forever; may the Lord rejoice in His works. Blessed be the name of the Lord for all time. From the rising of the sun to its setting let the Lord's name be praised. High above all nations is the Lord; above the heavens is His glory. O Lord, Your name is forever; O Lord, Your fame is through all generations. The Lord has set up his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all. Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth exult, and let them say among the nations, "The Lord is King!" The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for all time. The Lord is King for evermore; the heathen have vanished from his land. The Lord annuls the counsel of nations; He foils the plans of peoples. Many are the plans in man's heart, but it is the Lord's purpose that shall stand. The Lord's purpose stands forever; His plans are through all generations. For He spoke, and the world came into being; He commanded, and it stood firm. Surely the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation. Surely, the Lord has chosen Jacob to be His, and Israel as His prized possession. Surely, the Lord will not abandon His people, nor forsake His heritage. He, being merciful, forgives iniquity, and does not destroy; frequently He turns his anger away, and does not stir up all His wrath. O Lord, save us; may the King answer us when we call.

Ashrei

(Psalms 145) A song of praise. Of David. I will extol You, my God and king, and bless Your name forever and ever. Every day will I bless You and praise Your name forever and ever. Great is the LORD and much acclaimed; His greatness cannot be fathomed. One generation shall laud Your works to another and declare Your mighty acts. The glorious majesty of Your splendor and Your wondrous acts will I recite. Men shall talk of the might of Your awesome deeds, and I will recount Your greatness. They shall celebrate Your abundant goodness, and sing joyously of Your beneficence. The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in kindness. The LORD is good to all, and His mercy is upon all His works. All Your works shall praise You, O LORD, and Your faithful ones shall bless You. They shall talk of the majesty of Your kingship, and speak of Your might, to make His mighty acts known among men and the majestic glory of His kingship. Your kingship is an eternal kingship; Your dominion is for all generations. The LORD supports all who stumble, and makes all who are bent stand straight. The eyes of all look to You expectantly, and You give them their food when it is due. You give it openhandedly, feeding every creature to its heart’s content. The LORD is beneficent in all His ways and faithful in all His works.
The LORD is near to all who call Him, to all who call Him with sincerity. He fulfills the wishes of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and delivers them. The LORD watches over all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy. My mouth shall utter the praise of the LORD, and all creatures shall bless His holy name forever and ever.

The One who chose His people Israel to make known His greatness and the splendor of His glory, hear prayer; give dew and rain on the face of the earth, and sate the whole world with Your good, and fill our hand from Your blessings and from the wealth of the gift of Your hand. Protect and save this year from all bad things, and from all types of destruction, and from all types of punishment; and make for it hope and a peaceful end. Pity and have mercy upon us and upon all of our grain and our fruit; and bless us with rains of blessing; and may we merit life and plenty and peace, like the good years. And remove from us pestilence, sword, famine, evil animals, captivity and despoliation, the evil impulse, evil and difficult sicknesses and evil and difficult events; and decree upon us good decrees in front of You. And may Your mercies be revealed over Your traits, and comport Yourself with mercy to Your children, and accept our prayer with mercy and desire.)
for You hear the prayers of Your people Israel in mercy. Blessed are You, O Lord, Who hears prayer.

Temple Service

Be pleased, Lord our God, with Your people Israel and with their prayer, and restore the service to Your Holy Temple / Holy of Holies; be pleased to receive the prayers and fire offerings of the people of Israel in love.  May the service of Your people Israel always be acceptable to You. 
(On Rosh Chodesh/ New Month, Passover, or Sukkot include: Our God and God of our fathers, may these rise, come, reach, be seen, be favored, be heard, be visited, and be remembered, our remembrance and our consideration, the memorial of our fathers and the memorial of Messiah the son of David Your servant, the memorial of Jerusalem Your holy city, and in memorial of all the people of the house of Israel; before Your face for deliverance, for good, for grace, for loving kindness, for mercy, for life and for peace on the day of: Sukkot, Pesach, or Rosh Chodesh. Remember us today, Lord our God, for good, reckon us on this day for blessing and save us on this day for life. In the matter of salvation and mercy spare us and be gracious to us, have mercy on us and save us, for our eyes look to You, for You are the Kingly God of grace and mercy.) 
May our eyes behold Your return to Zion with compassion. Blessed are You, O Lord, Who returns Your presence (Shekhinah) to Zion. 

Thanksgiving

We gratefully thank You, for You, O Lord our God, are our fathers' God for all eternity, our Rock, our Shield of salvation generation to generation. We thank You and recount Your praise for our lives. We trust our lives into Your loving hand. Our souls are in Your custody and Your miracles are with us every day and Your wonders and goodness are with us at all times: evening, morning and noon. You are good, for Your mercies never fail us, and the Compassionate One, for Your loving kindness never ceases; forever we have placed our hope in You. 
(The rabbis thanks/<i>modim de'rabbanan</i>: We gratefully thank You, for You, O Lord our God, are our fathers' God, the God of all flesh, our Maker, the Maker of Creation. Blessings and thanksgivings to Your great and holy name for Your bringing us to life and preserving us. So [too], make us live and preserve us and gather our exiles to Your holy courtyards, to keep Your statutes and to do Your will and to serve You with a complete heart. About that which we thank You, blessed is the God of thanksgivings.)
(During the season of Hanukkah add: And we praise You for the miracles and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and for the victories and for the battles that You performed for our fathers in those days at this time:
In the days of Mattisyahu, the son of Yochanan the High Priest, the Hasmonean, and his sons, when the wicked kingdom of Greece rose up against Your people Israel to make them forget Your Torah and to stray from the laws of Your will, You, with great mercy stood by them in the time of their distress. You fought their fight, judged their cause and avenged them with vengence. You delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of the few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous and the arrogant into the hands of those engaged with Your Torah. For Yourself you made a great and holy name in Your world, You performed a great deliverance for Your people Israel on this day. After these things, Your children entered into the Holy of Holies of Your House, cleansed Your Temple, purified the place of Your Holiness, kindled lights in Your holy courts and established these eight days of Hanukkah to express thanksgiving and praise to Your great name.) 
(On Purim add: And we praise You for the miracles and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and for the victories and for the battles that You performed for our fathers in those days at this time: In the days of Mordecai and Esther, in Shushan the capital, when the evil Haman rose up against them, when he sought to destroy, murder, and to eliminate all the Jews, from the young to the old, infants and women, in one day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month of Adar, and plunder their wealth. In great mercy You frustrated his counsel and ruined his plan, and You returned his plan upon his own head and they hanged him and his sons upon the tree.) 
And for all these, may Your name be blessed and exalted, our King, always and forever and ever.
(Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur add: Inscribe for a good life all the children of Your covenant.) 
All the living shall gratefully acknowledge You, Selah; and praise Your name in truth, the God of our salvation and our help, Selah. Blessed are You, O Lord, Whose name is good and to Whom it is fitting to give thanks.

Birkat Kohanim

Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing, found in Your Torah, written by the hand of Moses you servant, and said to Aaron and his priestly sons, Your holy people:
May the Lord bless you and keep you.<br>May the Lord shine His face upon you and treat you graciously.<br>May the Lord lift His face towards you and grant you peace.

Peace

Establish peace, goodness, blessing, grace, loving kindness and mercy upon us and upon all Israel Your people. Bless us our Father, all of us as one, with the light of Your face. For in the light of Your face You gave to us, O Lord our God, the Torah of life and love of kindness and righteousness and blessing and compassion and life and peace. It is good in Your eyes to bless Your people Israel during all times and in all hours with Your peace. 
Blessed are You, O Lord, Who blesses Your people Israel with peace. 
<small><em>Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur add: </em>(In the book of life, blessing, peace and good prosperity may we be remembered and inscribed before You, ourselves and all the house of Israel, for a life of goodness and peace. Blessed are You, O Lord, Who makes peace.)  </small>

Concluding Passage

May the words of my mouth and the rumination of my heart be acceptable in front of You, O lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. My God, guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking deceit. To those who curse me, let my life remain silent and my life be like dust to all, open my heart to Your Torah, then I will pursue Your commandments. As for those who design evil against me, quickly nullify their counsel and disrupt their design. Act for Your Name's sake; act for Your right hand's sake; act for Your sanctity's sake; act for Your Torah's sake. Then Your beloved ones may be given rest; may Your right hand save and respond to me. May the words of my mouth and the musings of my heart be acceptable before You, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer. He Who makes peace in His heights, may he make peace upon us and to all Israel.  And we say Amen. 
May it be Your will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the Holy Temple be speedily rebuilt in our days and grant us our portion in Your Torah, and may we serve You there with reverence as in the days of old and the earliest of years. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to You O Lord, as in the days of old and the earliest years.

The king of the world, who ruled before any creature was created.
At the time they were made, all was according to His will, and then His name was called "King".
And after everything was finished, he alone ruled, awe-inspiring. 
He was, He is, and He will be with splendor.
And, he was first, with no second, to rule over him or to collaborate;
with no beginning and no end, he has the strength and the right.
And he is my G-d, my redeemer is alive; the rock who sustains me in a distressful day.
And he is my banner and refuge, the portion of my cup on the day I call out.
In his hand, I safegaurd my spirit, [for] when I sleep, [I know that] I will wake.
And with my spirit is my body; G-d is for me, and I will not be afraid.

May the Lord give our enemies that rise against us plagues in front of them. May the Holy One, blessed be He, guard and rescue our soldiers form all trouble and distress and from all affliction and illness; and send blessing and success in all the work of their hands. May He crush those that hate us below them and crown them with the crown of salvation and with the wreath of victory. And through them let the verse be fulfilled (Deuteronomy 20:4), "For it is the Lord, your God, that walks with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you." And let us say, Amen.
