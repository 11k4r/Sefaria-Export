Siddur Sefard

Upon Arising

Modeh Ani

<small>As soon as one awakes, he should rise like a lion to serve his Creator and say "I give thanks before you..." and so on until "Your faithfulness." [and since it does not contain the Divine Name,] it can be said without the washing of the hands.</small>
I give thanks before You, living and eternal King for You have returned my soul within me with mercy; great is Your faithfulness!
<small>And once he rises up, he shall wash his hands three times in a row, and recite "Beginning of wisdom", the blessing on "Tzitzits", and the dawn blessings.</small>
The beginning of wisdom is the fear of HaShem, its practitioners acquire a good understanding, His praise is eternal. Blessed is His Holy name and kingdom forever and ever.
<small>When donning the tzitzit he should say:</small>
Blessed are You, the LORD our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with his commandments and has commanded us concerning the commandment of tzitzit. 
May the Will be in front of you Adonai my God and the God of my fathers, so that the Mitzvah of tzitzit be considerable thing in front of you. And not only for its existence but also for all its related details and intentions, as 613 Mitzvots depend on it. Amen

Tallit






... Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, You sanctified us with his commandments and commanded us to wrap ourselves in tzitzit.

May it be the will before the Lord, our God and the God of our forefathers ,that he forgives me (and my husband and my children and my father and my mother) and all my kin. And that he give us and all Israel good and long lives. And that he memorializes us for good and blessing. And that he redeems us with a redemption of salvation and mercy, and that he blesses us great blessings. And that he supplies our houses. And that his spirit dwells among us. And that I merit to raise wise and perspicacious children and grandchildren; God-lovers, Lord-worshipers, honest men, holy progeny connected to God, and that illumine the world with Torah and good deeds and all the work of the Creator. Please hear my plea at this time. By the merit of Sarah and Rebecca and Rachel and Leah our matriarchs. And make effulgent our lamps, that they not extinguish ever, and make effulgent your countenance, that we are saved. Amen.

There is no measure to you, there is no one else but you, it's impossibl​​e without you, and who can be compared to you? There is no measure to you, God our Lord, in this world, and none beside you, our King, for life in the world to come. It's impossibl​​e without you, our redeemer,​ for the days of the Mashiach,​ and none compare to you, our savior, at the resurrect​ion of the dead.
