..."And the Lord remembered Channah... (Samuel I 2:21)" and it said earlier, "And her rival provoked her bitterly...(Samuel I 1:6)." Peninah would provoke her and irritate her day after day. What would she do? R' Nahman son of Abba said: Peninah would rise early and say to Channah, "Aren't you going to get up and wash your childrens' faces so they can go to school?" and at noon she would say "Aren't you preparing to welcome your children home from school?"...
R' Tanhuma son of  Abba said: when they sat down to eat, Elkanah would give every one of his sons his portion. What would Peninah do in order to provoke Channah? She would say to Elkanah, "Give this son of mine his portion. You did not give that son of mine his portion."
