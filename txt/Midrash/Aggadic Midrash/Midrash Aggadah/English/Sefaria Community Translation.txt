THE LORD SAID - The Holy One, Blessed is He, said:
ALL HAVING ONE LANGUAGE - Each understood what his fellow would say to him, whether 'clay' or 'brick,' and this way they would build. During the time that they had one language, they were not restrained from building. Rather, I will confuse their languages and they will put aside the construction. What did G-d do? He called the divine messengers and commanded them to descend below, and each one [of the messengers would teach] each family a different language, so that this family would not understand that family. And so they did, as it says, "Come, let us descend."

As it was taught; And the life of Sarah....
When she was 100, she was like 20 in sin, and when she was 20 she was like a 7 year old in beauty. Therefore, they said 100 and 20 and 7 years.

To Shimon, Shelumiel ben Tzurishaddai. Even though his descendant is Zimri, on whose account 24,000 died in a plague, G-d made peace with him and placed him next to Reuben, who had done repentance (a ba'al t'shuvah). Therefore it is said, "ben tzuri-shaddai," ("Shaddai is my rock")...

Verse 29

"And they wept for Aaron thirty days, all the House of Israel" (Numbers 20:29): What is stated about Aaron is greater than what is stated about Moses. As regarding Moses, only the men wept for him, but regarding Aaron, the men and the women wept for him - since he was one that pursued peace and loved peace, and restored peace between a man and his wife, and between a man and his fellow. This is [the meaning of] that which is written (Malachi 2:6), "He walked with Me in peace and justice, and brought many back from iniquity." And what did Aaron do? When he heard that two men or a man and his wife were arguing, he would go to one of them and say to him, "Your fellow came to me and is distraught in his heart that he angered you; so he cajoled me that I should come to you [and get your forbearance], so that he [can] come to you and be forgiven by you." And Aaron would not leave from there until he would remove all the hatred in his heart and bring peace between them. Then he would leave. And when he (the one with which Aaron had spoken) met his fellow, they would immediately love and embrace each other and kiss each other. And so was it during all the days of Aaron, peace be upon him; and such was his trait. When he heard that there was an argument between a man and his wife, he would not leave them until they made peace. Hence the men and the women wept for Aaron, but only the males wept for our teacher Moses, peace be upon him. And also [because] Moses would say, "Let justice pierce the mountain," whereas Aaron would bring a compromise between two litigants.
