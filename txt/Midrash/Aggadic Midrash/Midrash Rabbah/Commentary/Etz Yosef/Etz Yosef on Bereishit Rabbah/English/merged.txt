Paragraph 1


"And saw a palace." The matter of the parable is that whoever sees a beautiful and orderly building understands and acknowledges that there is a master and owner of this palace, and a wise artisan built it. Yet he saw the palace burning up in fire. Then he thought that its master and owner abandoned it, until the owner of the palace said to him "It is I who is the master of the palace and its owner," meaning, "From me it is burning." So too, the world testifies about itself that there is a Creator, who leads it with wisdom and kindness. Yet when the Creator saw that evil people cause damage to the world, the loss and annihilation burns like fire. From this was Abraham's mind confused, until the Holy Blessed One was revealed to him and said to him, "It is I who is the owner of this world and its master, and all of this annihilation and punishment was done intentionally. This is what is written "let the king be aroused by your beauty; since he is your lord, bow to him," for God wants his service.

Paragraph 10




Because until 13 years his powers are still hidden and he needs to work to reveal them. If so, the sin is not on the child, but on the father who didn't educate. When a child becomes 13 years old, he himself can choose [his actions] so his father is exempt and not punished on his son's behalf.
