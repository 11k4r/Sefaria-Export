Eichah Rabbah

Chapter 1



















































... for the comforter to restore my soul is removed from me – What is the name of the king Messiah? R’ Aba bar Kahana said: the Lord is his name, “…and this is his name that he shall be called, The Lord is our righteousness.” (Yirmiyahu 23:6) For R’ Levi said: it is good for a city that its name be the same as its king, and that the name of the king be the same as its God as it says “…and this is his name that he shall be called, The Lord is our righteousness.” R’ Yehoshua ben Levi said: Shoot is his name, as it says “…Behold a man whose name is the Shoot, who will spring up out of his place …” (Zechariah 6:12) R’ Yudan said in the name of R’ Ibbo: comforter is his name, as it says “…for the comforter to restore my soul is removed from me…” (Eicha 1:16) R’ Chanina said: they are not arguing, each one’s account is the same – he is comforter, he is shoot, because this statement supports the other statement of R’ Yudan in the name of R’ Iddo.
