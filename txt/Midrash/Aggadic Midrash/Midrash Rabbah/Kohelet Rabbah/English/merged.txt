... R’ Yehoshua ben Levi explained the verse as referring to the Holy Temple: The prophet said to Israel “And remember your Creator in the days of your youth (bachurotecha)…” (Kohelet 12:1) Remember your Creator while your youths (bachureichem) lasts. While the covenant with the priests lasts, as it says “And I did choose (u’vachor) him from all the tribes of Israel…” (Shmuel I 2:28) While the covenant with the Levites lasts, as it says “For the Lord, your God, has chosen (bachar) him out of all your tribes…” (Devarim 18:5) While the covenant with Jerusalem lasts, as it says ““…the city which I have chosen (bacharti).” (Melachim I 11:13) While the kingship of David lasts, as it says “And He chose (v’yivchar) His servant David…” (Tehillim 78:70) While the Holy Temple is still standing, as it says “I have chosen (bacharti) and consecrated this House…” (Divre HaYamim II 7:16) As long as you exist, as it is written “…the Lord your God has chosen you…” (Devarim 7:6)
