Chapter 29

1. I AM THE LORD THY GOD (XX, 1). It is written, Did ever a people hear the voice of God?  (Deut. IV, 33). Some sectarians once asked R. Simlai’: ' Are there not many deities in the world?’ He replied, ‘What makes you think so?’ ‘Because,’ they said, ‘it is written, "Did ever a people hear the voice of God?"’2 To which he replied, ‘It does not say medabberim (speaking) but "medabber".’3 Whereupon his disciples said to him: ' O teacher, you have thrust these off with a broken reed, but what answer will you give to us? ' R. Levi then offered them this explanation: It says, ’Did ever a people hear the voice of God?’ What does this mean? Had it said ‘The voice of God in His power’, the world would not have been able to survive, but it says instead: The voice of the Lord is with power (Ps. XXIX, 4)-that is, according to the power of each individual,4 according to the individual power of the young, the old, and the very small ones. God said to Israel: ‘Do not believe that there are many deities in heaven because you have heard many voices, but know ye that I alone am the Lord thy God,’ as it says, I am the Lord thy God  (Deut. V, 6).5
