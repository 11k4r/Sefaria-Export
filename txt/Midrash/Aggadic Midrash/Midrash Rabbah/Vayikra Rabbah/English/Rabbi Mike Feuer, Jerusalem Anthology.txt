Vayikra Rabbah

Chapter 1


R’ Abahu opened and said ‘“Those who dwelt in its shade shall return…” (Hoshea 14:8) This refers to the converts who come and take shelter in the shade of the Holy One. “…they shall revive [like] corn…” (ibid.) They will become primary, just as Israel as it says “…Corn [will give strength to] young men, and new wine will cause maids to speak.” (Zechariah 9:17) “…and blossom like the vine…” (Hoshea 14:8) As it says “You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out nations and planted it.” (Tehillim 80:9)’ Another explanation. “…they shall revive [like] corn…” (Hoshea 14:8) in their Talmudic learning, “…and blossom like the vine…” (ibid.) in their aggadic learning. “; it (fragrance) will recall the wine of Lebanon.” (ibid.) The Holy One said ‘the names of converts are beloved to Me like idolatrous wine which was offered before Me on the altar.’ And why is its name Lebanon? Because of the verse “…this good mountain and the Lebanon.” (Devarim 3:25) R’ Shimon bar Yochai taught: why is it called Lebanon, because it bleaches out (malbin) the sins of Israel like snow, as it says “…If your sins prove to be like crimson, they will become white as snow; if they prove to be as red as crimson dye, they shall become as wool.” (Yeshayahu 1:18) R’ Teviyumi said ‘because all hearts (levavot) rejoice in it, as it says “The fairest of branches, the joy of the entire earth- Mount Zion…” (Tehillim 48:3) The Rabbis say ‘because “…and My eyes and My heart (libi) shall be there at all times.” (Melachim I 9:3)
