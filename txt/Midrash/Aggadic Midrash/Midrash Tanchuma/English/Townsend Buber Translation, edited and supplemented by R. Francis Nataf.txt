<b>And it was on the eighth day:</b> Rabbi Tanchuma, Rabbi Chiya, Rabbah and Rabbi Berakhiya in the name of Rabbi Elazar [all] said, "Any place that it is stated, 'and it was,' it is nothing but a term of grief." Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmani said in the name of Rabbi Natan, "This midrash came up to our hands from the exile, 'Any place that it is stated, "and it was in the days of," it is nothing but a term of grief.'"
