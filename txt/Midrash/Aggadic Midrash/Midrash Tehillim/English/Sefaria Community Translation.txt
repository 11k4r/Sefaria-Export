Midrash Tehillim



Psalm 1













Another explanation of “happy is the man.” These are the sons of Korah that did not walk in the counsel of their father, as it says ““Move away from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing that belongs to them, [lest you be wiped out for all their sins.]” And “on the path of sins”: “the firepans of [these] sinners.” And “the company of scorners” this is Korah that was scorning Moses and Aaron. What did he do? He assembled all the community as it says “and he gathered against them the whole community.” He [Korah] began to speak scornfully. And he said to them, “There is a certain widow in my neighborhood and with her are two orphaned girls and she has one field. She came to plow and Moses said to her, ‘You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.’ She went to sow, and Moses said to her, ‘you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed.’ She went to harvest and to make heaps and he said to her ‘Leave me the droppings and the leavings and the corners.’ She went to do the threshing and he said to her, ‘Give me terumah and maaser terumah (tithes) and maaser rishon (the first tithe) and maaser sheni (the second tithe).’ She accepted the law upon herself and gave to him. What did she do? She sold the field and acquired two ewes to wear their fleece and to sell their offspring. When they gave birth, Aaron came along and said to her: “Give me the first borns as this is what HKBH said to me, ‘You shall consecrate to the LORD your God all male firstlings that are born in your herd and in your flock:’” She accepted the law upon herself and gave to him. The time came for shearing [the sheep] and she sheared them. He said to her, “Give me the best fleece as thus said the Holy One, Blessed be He to me, ‘and the first shearing of your sheep you shall give him.’” She said, “I do not have the strength to withstand this man, therefore I am slaughtering them and eating them [the ewes]. When she slaughtered them, he said to her, “Give me the foreleg, the cheeks, and the maw.” She said to him, “even though I have slaughtered them I have not been spared from his hand. She put them under a prohibition [cherem]. He said to her, “give it to me because it is written, ‘Everything that has been proscribed in Israel shall be yours.’” He took it and went. He left her weeping, she and her two daughters. Is such a law right that has contempt for the unfortunate?!All this they do and hang it upon the Holy One, Blessed be He! From this we learn he was a scorner.

Psalm 8


"The LORD is our Master, how mighty is Your Name in all the earth." Rav said: "We find three places where the angels prosecuted God; the creation of man, the tabernacle, and the giving of the Torah." Where do we find [this phenomenon] regarding man? When God wished to create man he consulted the angels as it says (Genesis 1:26) "Let Us make man." They began to say "What is man that you recall him?!" [God] replied " Tomorrow you'll see how smart he is." When He created man what did God do? He brought all animals before the angels and asked them the names of all the animals and they did not know. God said to them "Do you want to know the wisdom of Man? I will ask him and he will tell me what all their names." What did God do? He brought all the animals and birds before Adam as it says (ibid. 2:19) "And the LORD formed from the earth." Rabbi Acha said, Did it not already say (ibid. 1:25) "And God made the beasts of the land?" What does the word "and He formed" come to teach us? Rather there it says "and He made" i.e. created them and here it says יצר from the root that connotes convergence as in (Deuteronomy 20:19) "when you besiege a city. (Genesis 2:19) "And He came to Adam to see what to call them" Isn't God omniscient? Rather "to see" means "to show the angels Adam's wisdom [by showing what Adam would call them]," and Adam independently came up with the same name as God for each and every animal. Then God asked him, "And you, what is your name?" He replied, "it is appropriate to call me Adam because I was created from the earth (Adamah)." God asked, "And what's My name?" Adam replied "It is appropriate to call you the LORD because you are the Lord of the entire world." That is why He says (Isaiah 42:8) "I am the LORD, this is My name."

'Give thanks to G-d, call out His name'. Rabbi Yossi bar Halafta said to Rabbi Yishmael his son, "You want to see the presence of G-d in this world, then engage in Torah in the Land of Israel, as it is said 'Look for G-d and His strength, request His presence (His face) always' ".

Psalm 109












H' has chastised me greatly. Chastisements are to be loved, because they please (martzin) like sacrifices. For of sacrifices [Scripture] says: "that it may be pleasing (nirtzah) in his behalf, to atone for him." (Lev. 1:4) And of chastisements it is written: "as a father is pleased with (yirtzeh) the son." (Prov. 3:12) Another interpretation: Chastisements are to be loved, because they are more pleasing than sacrifices. Sin offerings and guilt offerings atone only for that [particular] transgression, as it is said: "that it may be pleasing (nirtzah) in his behalf, to atone for him." (Lev. 1:4) But chastisements atone for all [sins]. That is, H' has chastised me greatly [for all my sins, so my atonement is complete].
Open for me the gates of righteousness. In the next world [He] says to a person: What was your occupation? And he says: I fed the hungry. They say to him: Th[ere] is the gate of one who feeds the hungry; enter it. Another says: I gave water to the thirsty; and they say to him: Th[ere] is the gate of one who gives water to the thirsty; enter it. And the same for one who clothes the naked, and one who raises orphans and one who is charitable; and so with all the mitzvot. David said: I did all of the[se things]; open all of them for me. Therefore he says: Open for me the gates of righteousness so that I may enter them.

Psalm 110

o	“Of David. A psalm. The LORD said to my lord, “Sit at My right hand…” This is what the verse says “Who awakened one from the east whom righteousness met wherever he set his foot?” (Isaiah 41:2) The nations of the world we as if asleep, failing to take shelter beneath the wings of the Divine presence. Who awakened them to come and take shelter? Avraham, as it says: Who awakened one from the east. And not only the nations, but even righteousness itself was sleeping until Avraham awakened it. How did Avraham do this? He made an inn and opened doors in every direction in order to receive all those passing by, as it says “He planted a tamarisk (eshel) at Beer-sheba…” (Genesis 21:33) R’ Azaria said: what is this eshel (אשל)? It is an acronym for eating (אכילה), drinking (שתייה) and escorting one’s guests (לוייה). This is “righteousness met wherever he set his foot…”
