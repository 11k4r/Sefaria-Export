Yalkut Shimoni on Torah



Remez 1

In ten articles the world was created, and what is meant to be said, and in one article he could recover, but heal the wicked who destroy the world created in ten sayings and give good reward to the righteous who fulfill the world created in ten sayings....
 R. Yochanan said: "Against the ten commandments in which the world was created, and from May,
Rabbi Akiva said these twenty-two letters in which all the Torah was given as a bride, and they were engraved with a flame pen on a terrible crown of the Holy One, blessed be He, and when He sought to create the world, they descended and stood before God. In the beginning, the Lord entered his presence and said to him, "Master of the Universe, that you will create in me the world in which you are going to give the Torah to Israel by Moses, as the Torah commanded us to do." The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, "I will make an impression on you, and. He immediately came out in front of him with his mind. And after that, all the signs were entered, and after all of them they entered Bet. The Master of the Universe said to him, "I want you to create in me the world in me, which I say every day, Blessed be the Lord, Amen and Amen." The Creator replied, "Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord, immediately received the Holy One, blessed be He, and created the world in him, A thousand said to him, "Why are you silent, and you do not say anything to me?" A thousand said to him, "Master of the Universe, because I have no strength to say before you that all the letters are calculated in a large number and I am in a small number. Two at three in the third with three and all in one. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him, "Do not be afraid that you are the head of all of them as a king. You are one, and I am one, and the Torah is one, which I will give you to the people of Israel, as it is said: I am the Lord your God:

And from where one is called one, it is said, "How shall one thousand come after them?" And from where the Holy One, blessed be He, is called one, And where the Torah is called one, as it is said, "One Torah will be yours." I am the head of all the commandments and the top of all the letters:...
R. Yehuda bar Shalom said, "It is not written here, but in the beginning, in the merit of Israel, which was called first, as it is written," The Holy of Israel is to God, the beginning of its creation. " For example, why does this resemble a king of flesh and blood who did not have a son, and says, "Take him from Lenin and Kalmarin to Livni, and everyone would say, 'He has no son,' and he says: 'Take him out of Lenin and Kalmarin.' Rabbi Yehudah ben Pazi demanded that he inform you that they are the two worlds of this world and the world to come.
Another interpretation: Why (does the Torah begin) with the letter Bet? Because it is the language of blessing. And why (did it not begin) with the letter Alef? Because it is the language of cursing. 
Another reason why not in the first place is not to give an opening here to the Epicurean to say how the world can stand and it was created in the language of Arida, but God said: I create it in the language of blessing that I wish.
Another thing is why in the house, according to the fact that she has two poles up and one below, behind him he says to the Creator, "Who created you in the world?" . Rabbi Elazar bar Avina says 26 generations was a challenging challenge before God Almighty said before him, Master of the Universe I am the first of letters and you did not create your world in me God told him the world and its entirety were created only thanks to the Torah says God with wisdom founded I am destined to rest in the Sinai, and I will not open it except to you, as I say, I am the Lord your God. Bar Chunya said why his name is called Aleph that the Holy One, blessed be He, agrees to give the Torah to a thousand generations, as it is commanded by a thousand generations. Rabbi Hoshayah Rabbah I will be the master of the art of God, in the manner in which a king of flesh and blood builds Palatrin and does not build him from his own knowledge but from the knowledge of the artist and the artist does not build from his own knowledge, but rather he is hypocritical and has a knowledge of how he makes rooms And how does he do such a thing? The Holy One, blessed be He, looked at the Torah and created the world. And there is no beginning but Torah as to how the Lord said, "I will begin his journey." Rabbi Brachya says in the merit of Moses that the world was created, as it is stated in the beginning and the writing, and Rabbi Huna saw it first in the name of Rabbi Menahem because of three things the world was created in the merit of Challah and the merit of the tithes. And there is no beginning, but there is a certain portion that says the beginning of your cradles applies. And there is no beginning but a tenth of what you have said, the beginning of your fish. And there is no beginning but the firstborns. How many are the firstborn of your land? Tanna Debi Rabbi Yishmael Do not read Bereshit, but rather, by the beginning of Shitin from the six days of creation, it is said: "My thighs are like those wreaths that will flow from the hollow and descend to the abyss. Made by an artist The work of God's art: Shimon ben Azzai says and your answer is Rabbinic. Flesh and blood mentions his name and then praises Pelan Agusta flan fratata but God is not so but the needs of his world and then mentioned his name is said Genesis God then created:

Another thing, the Book of Adam's Descendants was passed before him.  He saw David's portion of life would be three hours. He said, "Master of the world, this should not be decreed! A thought has come to me."
He [Adam] said to him, "How many are my years?"
God said, "1,000 years."
Adam said, "Can I give some as a gift?"
"God said, "Yes."
Adam said, "I will give him 70 years to be his fate."
What did Adam do? He brought a contract and wrote on it a contract of gift; and it was executed by God, Metatron, and Adam. 
Adam said, "Master of the World, good looks are his, kingship, and songs of praise have I given him in my gift of 70 years of his life; and he will sing before you. And this is written where it says "behold I have come" in the book I have written [Tehillim 92].

"So the Egyptians enslaved the children of Israel with back breaking labor [b'farech]" (Ex. 1:13). R. Elazar says, "B'pe rach—with a soft mouth." R. Shmuel says, "B'frichah—With rigor." "And they embittered their lives with hard work[, with clay and with bricks and with all kinds of labor in the fields...]" (Ex. 1:14). Rava said, "At first with mortar and bricks, and ultimately with all field work." "[...] all their work that they worked with them with was back breaking labor." To the one who says b'frichah—for they exchanged the work of the men with that of women, and the work of the women with that of men. To the one who says there b'pe rach—certainly that was [also] with rigor. At the time that he said (Ex. 1:10), "Get ready, let us be clever with it," Pharaoh gathered all Israel and said to them, "Please, let some of you work with me today for wages," which is as written, "b'farech—b'pe rach, with a soft mouth." He took a sack and a rake, and whoever saw Pharaoh taking a sack and a rake and working with bricks, would do [likewise]. Right away Israel went with alacrity and worked at the craft all day according to their strength (for they were strong and mighty). When it got dark, overseers were set over them, and they said to them, "Count the bricks." They right away stood and counted them, and he said to them, "Make me the same [amount] every day." He appointed Egyptian overseers over Jewish officers. The overseers would come and count the bricks and find a number missing, and the officers were beaten in place of the rest of the people, [for] they would not betray them to the overseers. They said, "Better that we should be beaten than that the rest of the people be hurt." Therefore, when the Omnipresent said (Num. 11:16), "Gather for Me seventy men," Moses said, "Master of the universe, I do not know who is worthy and who is unworthy." He said to him (ibid.), " '[...W]hom you know'–for these are the elders of the people and their officers who gave themselves up to be beaten in their place in Egypt. They should come and take this greatness." From this you may learn that anyone who gives themselves up for Israel merits honor and greatness. "And with all manner of labor in the field" (Ex. 1:14)—For is it possible that they worked in the field and not the city? Rather, they decreed upon them, that the men should lie in the field, and the women in the city, in order to reduce their fertility. The women would warm up heated food for them and bring to their husbands all kinds of food and drink and reassure them, saying, "They did not subjugate us. Ultimately the Holy One blessed be He will redeem us." From this, they had relations and were fruitful and multiplied. What was their reward? They merited the spoils of Egypt and the spoils of the Sea [of Reeds], as it says (Ps. 68:14), "If you lie between the borders—the feathers of a dove covered with silver...." And it is written (Song 4:12), "A locked garden"—these are the women, who were modest like a garden without a breach. "[A] locked up spring" (ibid.)—these are the men, who were laid like springs upon the field.

...Rabi Pinchas and Rabi Chilkiyah said in the name of Rabi Simon: the ministering angels gathered to Hashem and said before Him: Master of the world, when is the beginning of the year? And He said: Why do you ask Me? I and you should ask the Court Below. And what is the meaning of "like Hashem our G-d whenever we call upon Him,"--calling upon Him is by the festivals, as it is said, "These are the festivals of Hashem, a holy calling." Rav Krispa said in the name of Rav Yochanan: in the past, these were the festivals of  Hashem; from now on, it is as you call them. If you call them, they are My festivals, and if not, they are not My festivals. "This month is for you"--you count according to it and the nations of the world do not count according to it. Rebbi said in the name of Rabi Yehuda bar Ilai: the way of the world is that the greater count according to the greater, and the smaller count according to the smaller. Eisav, who is greater, counts according to the sun, which is greater, and Yaakov, who is smaller, counts according to the moon, which is smaller. Rav Nachman said: it's a good sign; the greater one rules during the day and does not rule at night, so too the wicked Eisav rules in This World and does not rule in the World to Come. The smaller one rules by day and by night, so too Yaakov rules in This World and in the World to Come. Rav Nachman said: all the time that the light of the greater one shines, the light of the smaller one is not noticed; when the light of the greater one sets, the light of the smaller one is noticed. So too as long as the light of Eisav is shining, the light of Yaakov is not noticed; once Eisav's light sets, the light of Yaakov is noticed, as it is said: "Arise and give light..." This month [is the first of months:] Rav Shmuel bar Abba said, every month that is begun from six hours or less, the eye has power to see it. From six hours or more, eyes have no power to see it. And the month that Hashem said to Moshe [Nisan 2448] was begun from above six hours, and no eye could see it; but Hashem showed it to him with a finger and said to him, "this month....". Rav Acha said in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani: the year that Yisrael left Egypt, the months of the year and the months of the period were equal. Rav Chiyya said in the name of Rav Yochanan: Hashem wrapped Himself in a talis with tzitzis and stood Moshe here and Aharon here, and called to Michael and Gavriel, and He made them as if they were the witnesses of the new moon. He said to them: how did you see the moon? Before the sun or after the sun? To its north or to its south? How much was it tilted, and how wide was it?--He said to them, according to this order [of questioning] your children will be sanctifying the month Below; through an elder and through witnesses and through a talis with tzitzis...

Another Explanation "And first born of your children you shall redeem" (Exodus 13:13) Where [is this law sourced:] If his father did not redeem him, he should redeem himself. [We are] taught to say: "And all first born of my sons I will redeem" (Exodus 13:15). Rabbi Yosei the Galilean says since the Torah said "Redeem your sons" and "Teach your sons Torah", if you learn regarding the study of Torah that if his father did not teach him he teaches himself. So to if [his father] did not redeem him he is obligated to redeem himself. [This is] not [so] if you said regarding the study of Torah that it is equal in weight to everything such that if his father did not teach him [Torah] he teaches himself. You should say regarding redemption that it is not equal in weight to everything therefore if his father did not redeem him he should not redeem himself. Behold circumcision will prove that it is not equal in weight to everything for if his father did not circumcise him he circumcises himself. So to if his father did not redeem him he should redeem himself. [This is] not [so] if you said regarding circumcision [that one who is not circumcised] is cut off [from the Jewish people] that if his father did not circumcise him he circumcises himself. You should say regarding redemption that [one who is not redeemed] is cut off [from the Jewish people] therefore if he was not redeemed he should not redeem himself. You said explain. [From] a general principal all three can be understood. Circumcision is not like Torah study and Torah study is not like circumcision and neither of them are like redemption and redemption is like neither of them. The common element between them is that they are all a command for the father to do for his son [but] if the father did not do for his son the son shall do for himself. Accordingly anything that is a command for the father to do for his son [but] if the father did not do for his son the son shall do for himself. From here they said a person is obligated from the Torah to circumcise his son, to redeem him, to teach him Torah, to teach him a craft and to marry him off. Rabbi Akiva says even to teach him to swim. Rebbi says even manners. "It will be when your son will ask you tomorrow saying" (Exodus 13:14) there is 'tomorrow' now [literally the next day] and there is 'tomorrow' after a [long] time. "Tomorrow the sign shall come to pass" (Exodus 8:19) this is tomorrow now. "Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill" (Exodus 17:9) This is 'tomorrow' now. "Tomorrow your children will say to our children" (Joshua 22:24) This is 'tomorrow' after a [long] time. "What mean the decrees, laws and rules" (Deuteronomy 6:20) is found to be saying they are four sons: one wise, one simple, one wicked, and one who does not know to ask. The wise one what does he say? "What are the decrees, laws and rules etc." Accordingly you say to him about the laws of Passover and say to him "We do not have desert after the Passover sacrifice" (Mishna Pesachim 10:8). The simple one What does he say? "What is this?" You shall say to him "With a strong hand he took us out" (Exodus 13:14). The wicked one What does he say? What is this work for you? For you and not for him and because he takes himself out of the collective his is a heretic Accordingly you take him out of the collective and say to him "It is because of what the LORD did for me when I went free from Egypt." (Exodus 13:8) for me and not for him if he was there [in Egypt] he would not have been freed. And the one who does not know to ask you open for him as it says "You shall tell your son on that day" (ibid).

"And the waters will came back and cover the chariot and the horsemen" (Exodus 14:26) And even Par'oh, according to Rabi Yehuda, as it says "the chariots of Phar'oh and his army" (15:4). Rabi Natan says Par'oh was the exception, since we have this verse about him: "maybe for this I made you stand up"(Exodus 9:16). And there are those who say that at the end Par'oh went down and drowned, as it says "and the horse of Par'oh came" (Exodus 15:19). "And the children of Israel went into the sea in dry ground" - the angels of service were astounded, saying: 'the children of Israel, idolaters that they are, are coming on dry land?!' And from where do we know that even the sea was filled with rage from Above? Because the text says "and the waters were like rage to them" [since the vav is missing to the word chomah, wall, it can be read as chema, rage; so you can re-read the verse as "the water was like anger on their right and on their left"]. And what caused them to be saved from their right and their left? From the right, it was Torah, which they would receive later on, as it says "From His right, [He gave] a fiery law to them". And left? This is tefilin.

... Said R' Levi: The Holy One Blessed Be He appeared to them like a picture which is visible form all angles. A thousand people may gaze on it and it gazes on all of them. So is the Holy One Blesses Be He. When He spoke, every individual Yisrael maintained: "He spoke to me!" "I am Hashem your (plural) G-d" is not written here, rather " I am Hashem your (singular) G-d". Said R' Yosi: In accordance with each and everyone's personal capacities did the word speak to him. Do not be astonished at the Manna which came down on Yisrael - each one tasting the flavour that he was capable of tasting - the infants in accordance with their capacities... the young men in accordance with their capacities... and the old in accordance with their capacities. If that was so in the case of the Manna, that everyone tasted the flavour that he could appreciate, the word (the word of Hashem at the receiving of the Torah), all the more so! Said (King) David (Psalm 29:4): " The Voice of Hashem is in strength". It does not say "In HIS strength", but just strength - in the strength (capacities) of each man.

When the Holy One came to give the Torah to Moshe, he said over the order of the Readings, the Mishna, the aggadah and the Talmud as it says "And God spoke all these words..." (Shemot 20:1) - even what an experienced student would ask his teacher. The Holy One said to him go and "teach it to the Children of Israel..." (Devarim 31:19) Moshe replied 'Master of the world, you write it down for your children!' Gd said to him, 'I want to give it to them in writing, but it is revealed before me that in the future the nations of the world will rule over them and take it away from them. Then my children will be like the nations!' So Moshe said 'give them the Readings in written form and the aggadah, Mishna and Talmud orally.' "And the LORD said to Moses: Write down these..." (Shemot 34:27) this refers to the Readings, "...for in accordance with these..." (ibid.) refers to the Mishna and Talmud which make the distinction between Israel and the nations of the world.

[Ed.: "Menorah" down below should probably be Menuda. "Chazar l'Suro", is the only time in Chazal that that form appears.  It appears frequently, also in regard to converts, as Chazar M'suro.  Perhaps its a mistake here, or perhaps it is actually meant as some kind of opposite.  This translation begins in the middle, at a really cool part.] At that moment (while the people were mourning their punishment) God said to Moshe, go and bring some satisfaction to those poor ones, whose hearts have left them. Moshe said: Master of the Universe! With what can I give them satisfaction? God said back to him: Go and bring them satisfaction, with words of Torah. Which is what it means: “Speak to the Children of Israel, When you come to the land of your settlement, which I am giving to you, and you make a fire-offering to the Lord ..." (Num 15:2,3). At that moment there was a great quarrel between the Children of Israel and the converts. Such that God had to ask Moshe: Why are they making this quarrel?! Did I not write for you all, in My Torah, “The congregation shall have one law and the stranger residing among you the same law … one Torah and one justice” (15:15,16). From here, they taught: There are three kinds of converts. There is a convert that is completely like a non-Jew, a convert that is similar to a donkey, and there is a convert just like Abraham our forefather. What kind of convert is completely like a non-Jew? He has improperly killed meat and unkosher meat in his home, but he says, I’ll go and convert so I can be amongst them. Because they have good food and they’ve got holidays and Sabbaths, and I’ll still eat these in my house. So he twists [misrepresents? pushes?] himself and goes and converts. When he then turns from the proper path, he receives punishment, for his own good, to save him from what he is doing.  The Holy One said to Israel: My children, just as he loved you, so you must love him. As it says, “And you shall love the convert” (Deut 10:19). What kind of convert is similar to a donkey? He goes to marry a Jewish woman, and they say to him, we won’t allow you to be with her unless you convert.  So he twists himself and goes and converts.  When he then turns from the proper path, he receives punishment, for his own good, to save him from what he is doing. The Holy One said to Israel: My children, just as he sought comfort from you, so shall give him comfort. As it says, “And the convert you shall not oppress” (Ex 22:20).  What kind of convert is just like Abraham our forefather?  He goes and searches out all the nations in the world.  When he sees that they too tell of the goodness of the Jewish people, he says, I will go and convert, and thus bring myself under the wings of the Shechina.  As it says, “Let no convert who has joined himself to the LORD say, ‘The LORD will surely exclude me from his people.’ (Isa 56:3).
