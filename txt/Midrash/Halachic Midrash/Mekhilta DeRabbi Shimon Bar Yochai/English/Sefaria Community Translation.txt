<b>Your flocks:</b> "Your flocks come also from mine!" <b>Your herds:</b> "Your herds come also from my ministers!" <b>Take [them], as you said, and begone!:</b> Your prediction has been fulfilled! "Moses said, “You yourself must provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer up to the LORD our God" (Exodus 10:25) <b>And may you bring a blessing upon me also!:</b> Even women and children.  Another interpretation: "And may you bring a blessing upon me also." (Exodus 12:32)  From here you say that Pharaoh knew that he was lacking in prayer, and God does not forgive someone until he has persuaded his neighbor [to forgive him as well].  What reward did he take for this? -- "In that day, there shall be an altar to the LORD inside the land of Egypt" (Isaiah 19:19) The mouth that said, "Who is the LORD that I should heed Him [and let Israel go]?" (Exodus 5:2) is [also] the mouth that said, "The LORD is in the right [and I and my people are in the wrong.]" (Exodus 9:27)  What reward did he take for this? -- "You shall not abhor an Egyptian, for you were a stranger in his land." (Deuteronomy 23:8) The mouth that said, "I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil," (Exodus 15:9) is [also] the mouth that said, "Let us flee from the Israelites, [for the LORD is fighting for them against Egypt.]" (Exodus 14:25)  What reward did he take for this? -- "You put out Your right hand, The earth swallowed them." (Exodus 15:12) They merited to be buried, that beast and birds would not eat them.

Chapter 13








"That the Torah of the Lord be in thy mouth" -- to exclude women [from tefillin]. What is exemplary about tefillin? They are a positive time-triggered commandment from which women are exempt. So too, are women exempt from all positive time-triggered commandments.

Chapter 14



















..."And the waters were a wall for them" Made them as a type of wall. "On their right and on their left" On their right due to the merit of the Torah that they would in the future receive through the right, as it is said "From His right, a fiery law to them" (Deut. 33:2). And on their left: this is prayer.
