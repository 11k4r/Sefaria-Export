... …R’ Yosi haGalili said ‘when Israel entered the Red Sea, mount Moriah was already uprooted from its place with Yitchak altar upon it and its woodpile in place. It was as if Yitzchak was tied and placeo on the altar and Avraham was stretching out his hand to take the knife in order to slaughter his son, as it says “And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife, to slaughter his son.” (Bereshit 22:10)…

Four are called an inheritance (nachalah). The Holy Temple is called an inheritance, as it says “…on the mount of Your heritage…” (Shemot 15:17) The land of Israel is called an inheritance, as it says “…in the land which the Lord, your God, gives to you as an inheritance…” (Devarim 25:19) So too the Torah is called an inheritance, as it says “From the gift, to the streams (nachliel)…” (Bamidbar 21:19) And Israel is called an inheritance, as it says “…My people and My heritage, Israel…” (Yoel 4:2) The Holy One said: let Israel, who are called inheritance, come to the land of Israel, which is called inheritance, and build the holy Temple, which is called in heritance, in the merit of the Torah, which is called inheritance. That is why it says ‘on the mount of your heritage.’ “Directed toward Your habitation…” (Shemot 15:17) this is one of the indications that the throne below is aligned with the throne above. So too it says “The Lord is in His Holy Temple. The Lord-His throne is in Heaven…” (Tehillim 11:4) And it says “I have surely built You a house to dwell in (bet zevul); a settled place for You to dwell in forever.” (Melachim I 8:13)
