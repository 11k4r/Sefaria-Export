… one verse says “And David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver,” (Shmuel II 24:24) and another verse says “And David gave to Ornan for the place shekels of gold weighing six hundred.” (Divre HaYamim I 21:25) How can both of these verses stand? The whole threshing-floor was six hundred while the place of the altar was only fifty. Rebbe says in the name of Aba Yosef be Dostai: one verse says “David purchased the threshing-floor,” while the other verse says “David gave to Ornan for the place shekels of gold weighing six hundred.” How can both of these verses stand? There were twelve tribes and he took fifty from each trobe which makes six hundred in total. R’ Elazar ben Shamuah says “and David bough the threshing-floor and the oxen,” just as is explicit there. And what is explicit there? “David gave to Ornan for the place shekels of gold weighing six hundred,” but the oxen for the offering and the threshing-tools and yokes for wood he purchased for fifty.
