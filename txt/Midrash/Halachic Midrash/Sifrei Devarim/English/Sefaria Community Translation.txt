"And the curse, if you do not hearken": From this we can learn that Moses did not command the Jews until his last days when he was about to die and had witnessed all the miracles. Therefore it states "After he had smitten...(Devarim 1:4)".

From here it was taught: One may fulfill his obligation [of rejoicing] with meat of voluntary sacrifices. I might have thought [that one can likewise fulfill his obligation] with fowl and meal-offerings? Therefore it states "Only..." [to exclude this].

(Devarim 20:3) "And he shall say to them "Hear, O Israel, who is the man that is fearful and faint-hearted...and the officers shall continue": Why was all this stated? So the cities of Israel should not be desolate. As Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai has said: Come and see how G-d cares for human dignity.When one [soldier] returns, the others would say "maybe he has just built a house" or "maybe he has betrothed a woman". All had to bring proof besides the fearful one whose situation was evident. He heard shields clashing and was scared, blaring trumpets and was shaken, he sees swords being wielded and loses control of his bodily functions.

(We are hereby taught that peace is offered for two days, and a third day before the battle. And so it states: (I Samuel 30:1) "And David Remained in  Tziklag for two days." And gentile cities are not besieged fewer than three days before the Sabbath, (so that the siege not extend into the Sabbath); but if the siege began, it is not interrupted. This is one of three lessons taught by Shammai the Elder: A sea voyage is not begun fewer than three days before the Sabbath. When is this so? For a long voyage, but for a short one, it is permissible.)

This tells me only if there are many and all are loved or hated. Whence do I derive (that the same applies) even if there are only two? From "two wives".

(Variantly: Just because he used his father's money he must die?!  Only he is judged based on his future behavior -  better he die while [relatively] innocent and not for more severe sins. His father desired a captive woman and brought the devil into his home and caused his son to be rebellious. The result will be that he will kill him in an unnatural way, as it states (v. 22) "And if there be in a man a sin whose judgment is death, then he shall be put to death...").





"And he does not listen to them": This teaches that he is flogged in the presence of three.

(Geese and hens that rebelled (i.e. flew away) and nested in an orchard — must be sent. If they nested in a house — one is exempt from sending.
"fledglings or eggs,": I would understand: the minimum of "fledglings" — two; the minimum of eggs — two. Fledglings have a purpose and eggs have a purpose, to exclude dead fledglings and winnowed (non-viable) eggs, for these have no benefit. If there is only one chick or one egg in the nest, he must send, for it states "if there chance before you a bird's nest" - in any event.) 
 "on the way in any tree or on the ground": on the way is in public property, excluding if they were tied up.
[Variantly: "Send": Scripture speaks of a clean bird. — But perhaps it speaks of an unclean bird too? It is, therefore, written (Ibid. 14:11) "Every clean bird you may eat": This is a prototype, viz.: Wherever "bird" is mentioned in Scripture, a clean bird is understood (unless specified otherwise) as R' Yoshia has stated. If after sending he turned his face away from it he is exempt from sending further.]

"And now he has made a libelous accusation...and these are the signs of my daughter's virginity": So we have witnesses who contradict his [the husband's] witnesses.

Variantly: "When the Most High caused nations to inherit": When the Lord caused the nations to inherit the world, he apportioned to them the purgatory, as it says (Ezekiel 32:23-30) "Assyria is there with all her company ...  Elam and all her masses ... all the princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there". And who will receive the wealth and honor of all these? Israel! Therefore it states "He set the bounds of the peoples".
