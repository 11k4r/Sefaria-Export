Chapter 1



Mishnah 1

We have already explained the description of how the transmission happened in the introduction of our words in this essay. And [so] our intention here is only to explain the words of piety and ethics alone, to encourage the acquisition of certain virtues the benefit from which is great. And we will also elaborate to warn about certain vices that [bring] much damage. And [for] the rest, I will only explain the words and some of the concepts, because their concepts are [already] elucidated, except for a few of them.
<b>Be deliberate in judgment: </b> That they should delay in reaching the verdict and not determine it quickly before they [fully] understand it. As it is possible that new matters will be revealed to their eyes that were not revealed at the beginning of [their] thought.
<b>and make a fence for the Torah:</b> they mean to say the decrees and ordinances that distance a man from sins. As He, may He be blessed stated (Leviticus 18:30), "And you shall guard My guarding." And it was said in its explanation (Moed Katan 5a), "Make a guarding [fence] for My guarding."

Mishnah 2

He is saying that with wisdom, and that is the Torah; and with enhancement of [good] traits, and that is acts of lovingkindness; and with the fulfillment of commandments, and that is the sacrifices [referred to in the mishnah as service] - there will be a continuous refinement of the world and ordering of its existence in the most complete way.

Mishnah 3

A reward (<i>pras</i>) is what one calls a benefit that is granted to a person by someone who does not gain from him, but [rather] does it by way of kindness and grace. [It is] like when a man tells his servant or his young son or his wife, "Do such and such and I will give you a dinar or two." That is the difference between a reward and a wage (<i>sachar</i>), since a wage is that which is given by [way of an] obligation. And this pious one said that you should not serve God, may He be blessed, in order that He will do good to you and benefit you with kindness and that you should hope for the benefit and serve Him for its sake. Indeed, serve Him like servants that are not hoping for endowment or the giving of kindness. He meant with his that they should serve Him from love, as we said in Chapter Ten of Sanhedrin. And nonetheless, he did not exempt us from fear [of God]. And [so] he said, "Even as you serve from love, do not discard fear completely, 'and may the fear of Heaven be upon you.'" As the commandment of fear has already come in the Torah, and that is its stating (Deuteronomy 6:13), "Fear the Lord, your God." And the sages said (Yerushalmi Berakhot 9:7), "Serve from love, serve from fear," and they said that the one who loves will not forget a thing from that which he was commanded to do, and the one who fears will not do what he was warned from doing - as fear is a great pathway with the negative commandments, and all the more so, with the arational commandments. And this sage had two students - one whose name was Tsadok and one whose name was Beitos. And when they heard him say this statement, they went out from in front of him and one said to his fellow, "Behold, the teacher said explicitly that there is no benefit and punishment for a person and there is no hope at all" - as they did not understand his intention. And one strengthened the hand of his friend and they exited the group and left the Torah. One group connected itself to one and another group to his fellow. And the sages called them Sadducees and Boethusians. But when they could not gather congregations due to that which follows from this belief - as this evil belief disengages the united, all the more so will it not unite the disengaged - they leaned towards belief in the thing which they could not deny among the masses. As if they would put this out of their mouths, [the masses] would have killed them. I mean to say [that this thing is] the words of Torah. And [so] each one said to his party that he believes in the Torah, but disagrees with the transmission [of its oral explanation] - that it is not true. And this was to exempt themselves from the accepted commandments and ordinances and decrees. Since they could not push off everything - the written [Torah] and the received [explanation].  And also [this way], the way of interpretation was broadened for them. Since once the explanation was given to their choice, he was able to be lenient in what he wanted and to be strict in what he wanted. [This is] since he did not believe in the fundamentals at all, yet he sought things that would still be accepted by some people. And from then these evil groups came out. And they are called Karaites in these lands - I mean to say, Egypt. And their names among the sages are Sadducees and Boethusians. And they are the ones that began to question the transmission and to explain all of the verse according to what appears to them without listening to the sage at all, [which is] the opposite of what He, may He be blessed, stated (Deuteronomy 17:11),  "You shall act in accordance with the instructions given you and the ruling handed down to you; you must not deviate from the verdict that they announce to you either to the right or to the left." 

Mishnah 4

<b>A meeting house:</b> A house of meeting, meaning to say that you should make your house always available for the gathering of sages, like in synagogues and houses of study (<i>batei midrash</i>); such that if a man says to his fellow, "Where can I meet with you, where can I confer with you," he will [answer] him, "In the house of x."

Mishnah 5

<b>"Open":</b> That you should have a gate open to the path of wayfarers, such that every wayfarer that need something or is hungry or thirsty will enter the house immediately.
<b>"may the poor be members of your household":</b> He is saying that it is necessary that the servants be the poor and the indigent. And this is more fit than purchasing slaves. And so would the sages condemn the purchase of slaves and would praise one whose servants and members of his household were the poor. 
<b>They so stated with his wife:</b> It is known that the majority of talk with women is about matters of sex. Because of this, he said that increasing conversation with them is forbidden, since he "causes evil to himself." He means to say that he acquires lowly traits for his soul, and that is the abundance of desire.
<b>"and neglects the words of Torah":</b> It is understood that he wastes time with other occupations.
<b>"and, in his end, he inherits Geihinam":</b> because of this conversation of rebellion, and he obligates himself in the punishment.

Mishnah 6

<b>"Make for yourself a mentor":</b> He means to say even if he is not fit to be your mentor; still place him upon you as a mentor, so that you can give and take (discuss and argue) with him, and as a result of this the study of wisdom will come to your hand. As the study of a man on his own is good, but his study from someone else will be better established in his hand and it will be more clear - and even if he is like him in wisdom or below him. And so did they elucidate the explanation of this commandment. And he said, "<b>acquire for yourself a friend"</b>. He said it with an expression of acquisition and he did not say, "Make for yourself a friend," or "Befriend others." The intention of this is that a person must acquire a friend for himself, so that all of his deeds and all of his matters be refined though him, as they said (Taanit 23a), "Either a friend or death." And if he does not find him, he must make efforts for it with all his heart, and even if he must lead him to his friendship, until he becomes a friend. And [then] he must not let off ever from following [his friend's] will, until his friendship is firmed up. [It is] as the masters of ethics say, "When you love, do not love according to your traits; but rather love according to the trait of your friend." And when each of the friends has the intention to fulfill the will of his friend, the intention of both of them will be one without a doubt. And how good is the statement of Aristotle, "The friend is one." And there are three types of friends: a friend for benefit, a friend for enjoyment and a friend for virtue. Indeed, a friend for benefit is like the friendship of two [business] partners and the friendship of a king and his retinue; whereas the friendship for enjoyment is of two types - the friend for pleasure and the friend for confidence. Indeed, the friend for pleasure is like the friendship of males and females and similar to it; whereas the friend for confidence is when a man has a friend to whom he can confide his soul. He will not keep [anything] from him - not in action and not in speech.  And he will make him know all of his affairs - the good ones and the disgraceful - without fearing from him that any loss will come to him with all of this, not from him and not from another. As when a person has such a level of confidence in a man, he finds great enjoyment in his words and in his great friendship. And a friend for virtue is when the desire of both of them and their intention is for one thing, and that is the good. And each one wants to be helped by his friend in reaching this good for both of them together. And this is the friend which he commanded to acquire; and it is like the love of a master for a student and of the student for the master.
<b>"and judge every person as meritorious:"</b> Its subject is when there is a person whom you do not about him if he is righteous or if he is wicked and you see him doing an act or saying something and if you interpret it one way it will be good and if you interpret in another way it will be bad - [in this case,] take it to the good and do not think bad about it. But if the man is known to be famously righteous and of good deeds; and an action of his is seen that all of its aspects indicate that it is a bad deed and a person can only determine it to be good with great stretching and a distant possibility, it is fit that you take it that it is good, since there is some aspect of a possibility that it is good. And it is not permissible for your to suspect him; and about this did they say (Shabbat 97a), "The body of anyone who suspects proper ones will be struck." And so [too] when it is an evildoer and his deeds are famous, and afterwords we see him that he does a deed, all of the indications about which are that it is good but there is an aspect of a distant possibility that it is bad; it is fit to guard oneself from him and not to believe that it is good, since there is a possibility for the bad. And about this is it stated (Proverbs 26:25), (Also) "Though he be fair-spoken do not trust him, etc." But when he is not known and the deed is indeterminate towards one of the two extremes; according to the ways of piety, one must judge a person as meritorious towards whichever extreme of the two extremes [would be the case].

Mishnah 7

<b>"Do not befriend an evildoer":</b> in [any] type of friendship and companionship, so that you will not learn from his deeds. And we have already elucidated in the previous chapters that a man learns from the vices [found] in the company of evildoers. And he said [further] if you sin or you see that one sin, do not be confident and say that God, may He be blessed, will only punish him in the world to come; and do not despair of quick vengeance from Him for this sin.

Mishnah 8

 <b>"The judges' advisers (literally, organizers)":</b> They are people that study the arguments and the laws until the people become experts in their cases. As they compose questions and answers: when the judge says this, answer him that; and when the litigant argues this, so should be your answer - as if they are organizing the case, and the litigant is [coming] in front of them. And that is why they are called the judges' organizers - it is as if they organize the cases in front of them. And they warned them from being similar to them; meaning to say to teach one of the litigants an argument that will benefit him and to say to him, "Say this," or "Refute [an opposing claim] in such and such a way." And even if he knew about him that he was the victim and that his fellow's claim against him is false according to what he truly thinks, nonetheless, it is not permissible for him to teach him an argument that will save him or benefit him at all.

Mishnah 9



Mishnah 10

This 'government' (<i>rishut</i>) is the authorities. And in these three traits there is refinement of faithfulness and of the world. As with the absence of work, things will be tight for him and he will rob and be unfaithful. And with the pursuit of lordship, he will have challenges in the world and bad things; as since people will be jealous of him and disagree with him, he will lose his faithfulness. [It is] as they say (Sanhedrin 103b), "Once a man is appointed an officer over the community below, he becomes an evildoer above." And so [too, regarding] familiarity with the government in the early days and coming close to it, it was very unusual to escape from [the damage caused by] it in this world. As he will not pay attention to anything except that which brings him close to it. And you know the matter with Doeg - and even though the authority with which Doeg became close was the anointed of God and a prophet and God's chosen one, may He be blessed.

Mishnah 11

"Evil waters" is a nickname for heresy. And they said, "Be careful with your words" among the masses, and there should not be in in your words [something] that can support a different interpretation [than what you mean]. As if there are heretical men there, they will interpret them according to their beliefs. And the students will have already heard them from them and they will turn to heresy. And they will think that these were your beliefs and there will be a desecration of God, as happened to Antigonos with Tsadok and Beitos.   

Mishnah 12

<b>"Of the disciples of Aharon":</b> They said (The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan 12) that when Aharon, peace be upon him, sensed that the insides of a person were bad or they told him that his insides were bad or that he had a sin in his hand, he would greet him first and would be friendly towards him and would speak much with him. And that man would become embarrassed about himself and say, "Woe is to me! If Aharon knew what is hidden in my heart and the evil of my actions, he would not permit himself to [even] look at me, all the more so to speak to me. And yet he treats me with the presumption that I am a proper man. [Hence] I will confirm his words and his thought and I will return to the good." And he would become from his students who learn from him. And the Holy One, blessed be He, stated when He described him with this trait (Malachi 2:6), "He walked with Me in peace and righteousness, and brought many back from iniquity." And it is this famous matter about him that Hillel had in mind. And he also said when a man's name spreads for greatness, its termination will be announced. And he would also say, that God, may He be blessed, kills the one who doesn't read [the Bible] much, but the one who does not learn at all is fitting to be killed [now]. And [he also said] that one who "uses the crown" will die, meaning to say one who earns a livelihood from Torah and receives [tangible] benefit from it. And this was his intention in this statement, as will be explained in this tractate. And it is stated by way of mnemonic, "Student (yes), another man (no)," meaning to say that it is not permissible for a Torah scholar to receive service from any man except for his students.     

Mishnah 13



Mishnah 14

He said, "If I myself will not be the one that arouses my soul to virtue, who will arouse me, as I have no one to stimulate me from outside," like we have elucidated in the second chapter. "And since it is in my power to incline my soul to any side that I want, what deed have I done from the good deeds." It is as if he is [questioning] himself and saying, "What am I?" [This is] to say, "What is [becoming of] me? I am not complete, even if I did this matter." And afterwards he went back and said, "If I do not acquire these traits now in the days of my youth, when will I acquire them? Not in the days of old age, as it is difficult to veer from [one's] characteristics at that time because the acquisitions and the traits have hardened and settled - whether they are virtues or whether they are vices. And the wise one said (Proverbs 22:6), "Educate a youth according to his way, and he will also not veer from it when he gets old."

Mishnah 15

He said to make Torah study the center and the main thing and of your other affairs should follow it - whether they turn up or whether they not turn up, but there is no damage [from their] absence. And they said (Bava Metzia 87a), "The righteous say little and do much" - like our father, Avraham, who designated one loaf of bread and brought "curds and milk and a calf" (Genesis 18:8) and three <i>seah</i> of fine flour. "And evildoers say much and do not do even a little" - like Efron who gave everything [away] in his words, but in practice did not even leave one small coin from the [purchase price].
<b>"a pleasant countenance":</b> That is when he interacts with the creatures calmly and with pleasant and welcome words.

Mishnah 16

<b>Rabban Gamliel says, "Make for yourself a mentor, remove yourself from doubt and do not frequently tithe by estimation."</b>As they say in Talmud Yerushalmi Moed Katan 1:10 it states, "Go and bring me an elder from the marketplace and I will rely upon him and permit [it] to you."
