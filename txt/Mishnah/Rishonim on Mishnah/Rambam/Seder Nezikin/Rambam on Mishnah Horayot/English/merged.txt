As is known, men are responsible to fulfill all the commandments and women are responsible for some of them, as explained previously in Kiddushin.   He is more holy and therefore takes precedence in life and death matters.  
And when it is said that both of them are at risk of molestation, Heaven forbid, when both of them are held captive and the captors desire them both for relations, the man is redeemed before the woman because this [type of behavior] is not the way of a man and their desire for him is not natural for him.
