Verse 23

"Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech listen to my statement." His wives did not listen to him, as in Isaiah (32) "Carefree women, come, listen to my voice; confident daughters, listen to my statement." And therefore it says "Because I killed a man for my anger and a lad for my bruising." There is cause for his wives to fear him, because he has killed several people. According to another interpretation, he warned them that they are not stronger than the "man" that "I killed" and if they think that he would not hurt them because they are women, behold, he has also killed a child, so he would not hesitate to harm them as well.
