Rabbeinu Yonah on Pirkei Avot



Perek 1



Mishna 1

<b>Moshe recieved the Torah from Sinai, etc.:</b> (I will begin the commentary on "Avot" of our great, pious and holy rabbi, Rabbi Yonah the son of Rabbi Avraham, may he be remembered for blessing.) Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 30a) "One who wishes to be pious should fulfill the words of Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), and [some] said about it, the words of Damages (Nezikin)". And since a person ascends the steps of piousness by doing one of these matters, they placed [Avot] in the Order of Damages. And even though they also said to fulfill the words of Blessings (Berakhot) which is in the order of Seeds (Zeraim); because it speaks of the blessings on seeds and fruits, they placed it in that order (Editor's note: See what Midrash Shmuel wrote about this in the name of Rabbi Yosef Nachmias, may his memory be blessed). Furthermore, since it is the teachings of the Sanhedrin, they placed it in the order of the laws (of Damages); and so [too], all the sages mentioned [here] until Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai are all from the Sanhedrin. 
<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> Both the written Torah and the oral Torah. As the Torah was given with its explanation. As if it were not so, it would be impossible to understand [its contents]. As behold, it is written (Leviticus 19:13), "do not rob" - and all of the [laws of] damages are within this negative commandment, and they themselves are the Torah that was received by Moshe at Sinai, even though they were not written. And it is also written (Deuteronomy 17:8), "between a blood and a blood and between a judgement and a judgement and between an infection and an infection" - and many of the sightings of blood and many of the various judgments and so many of the infections are known to us by the transmission [of this information]... And they are not explained [in writing] because it is not allowed to be written. And it is written (Exodus 24:12), "and I will give you the stone tablets and the Torah and the commandment" - "Torah" is the written Torah; "and the commandment" is the oral Torah. it comes out that you say that every commandment that He gave to Moshe at Sinai, was given with its explanation. And that which is written is what is called the written Torah and the explanation is what is called the oral Torah. And Moshe learned it from the mouth of the Mighty One.  
<b>and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> As it is stated (Exodus 33:11), " but his attendant, Joshua son of Nun, a youth, would not stir out of the tent."
<b>and Yehoshua to the Elders:</b> As it is stated (Joshua 24:31), and all the days of the elders who had length of days after Joshua."
<b>and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly:</b> And that is Ezra and his group. And [some of] the prophets of the Second Temple were in that group, as they said in Yevamot 16a, "Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said, 'When Chaggai said these three things, he was sitting on this mortar.'" Hence the prophets of the Second Temple were there after the destruction, since Haggai the prophet was there. And the men of the Great Assembly transmitted it to the men of their generation. And the sages [transmitted it] to their children after them in each and every generation. And the transmission was from one sage to another, until all of the sages of Israel gathered and a suggestion was given from all of their mouths to write down the oral Torah. And [so] they wrote and sealed the Talmud, and afterwards nothing was added to it and nothing was taken away from it. And that generation also transmitted it to the Geonim and the transmission was from one Gaon to another, one rabbi to another - until this day. 
<b>They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment:</b> They said [this] to teachers of legal decisions and decisors of legal decisions and decisors of litigation; that they should not rely on the first thought, but rather upon great deliberation and incisive investigation, so that they not err in their evaluation. As a man who is quick to make a decision is called a sinner - and even though he thought he was saying the truth, it is not [considered] accidental but rather is [considered] to be close to volitional, since he did not put it into his heart to say, the quick hearts do not understand to know. As error is found in all men, as the rabbis say (Avot 4:13), " Be careful in study, for an error in study is considered an intentional transgression." And about this matter, Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 26:12), "If you see a man who thinks himself wise, there is more hope for a dullard than for him." And it is as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Avot 4:7), "One who is nonchalant about giving legal decisions is an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit." Therefore, it is incumbent upon a man who makes legal decisions to go back and forth on the matter and let his thought ripen and to hold on to it; as the matter that they said (Sanhedrin 35a) [that] we should ripen a judgement, as through ripening and deliberation, he adds reasoning to his reasoning and sharpness to his sharpness, until he judges a completely true judgement. As he will see to say with the second thought that which he did not see with the first. And about this matter, Asaf stated (Psalms 73:21), "As my heart ripened and my kidneys were silent," which is to say [that] after my heart has ripened and been sharp with wisdom and with my kidneys, I have been silent and have refined my understanding to know. As without this, I have not known, and this is my portion. (And as) it is after it, "I was a dolt, without knowledge; I was brutish toward You." And the reason [they] said, <b>"Be deliberate in judgment,"</b> is in order to warn about litigation more than other legal decisions, as they are fundamental in the knowledge of Him, may He be blessed and elevated; and as Yirmiyahu the prophet stated (Jeremiah 9:23), "ponder and know Me, for I am the Lord who makes kindness, justice, and equity in the world; for in these I delight, declares the  Lord." And how can a man a ponder and know God, as it is not possible? However with this have we known Him, by dong judgment and justice, since God does these. And that is what is stated (Jeremiah 22:16), "He judged for the poor and needy— then all was well. That is truly knowing Me, declares the  Lord." And it is is written in another place (Micah 6:8), "And what does the Lord require of you? Only to do justice and to love kindness," since judgments are a pillar of the Torah. And from them the world is made firm, as is said in the Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 30 3), "It is written in front of The Ten Commandments, 'and they will judge the people at all times' (Exodus 18:22). And after the Ten Commandment, it is written, 'And these are the laws' (Exodus 21 1). There is a parable [about this] concerning a matron that was walking along the way and her armed guards were walking in front of her and behind her."
<b>raise up many disciples:</b> As per the opinion of Beit Hillel. [This is] like the matter that we have learned (The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan 2:9), "Beit Shammai say, 'We only teach a student who is fit, modest, proper and who fears Heaven, as it is stated (Job 20:26), "All (darkness) waits for his treasured ones." And Beit Hillel say, 'We teach everyone: One hundred so that ten good ones will come out from them; and ten so that two will come out of them; and two, "since since you do not know which will be proper, this one or that one or if they will both be equally good." And so was there a story of Hillel, who brought together all of his students and said to them, 'Are all of you here?' They said [back] to him, 'Yes.' One of his students said to him, 'All of them are here except the smallest one.' He said to them, 'Let the small one come, who the generation in the future will follow.' And they brought Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai. Behold that one should not push off the small ones for the bigger ones, since the kids will become goats." And about this matter the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded (Yevamot 62b), "'Sow your seed in the morning, and don’t hold back your hand in the evening' (Ecclesiastes 11:6), - if you have raised disciples in your youth, raise disciples in your old age." Behold that the multiplication of disciples is a very good thing and a merit to the teacher.
<b>and make a fence for the Torah:</b> As the matter that is stated (Leviticus 18:30), "And you shall guard My guarding"; which is to say, make a guarding for my guarding. And a fence is a great thing and it is praiseworthy to make a fence for the commandments so that the one who fears the word of God not stumble in them. Hence one who observes the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed - which are the fences for the commandments of the Torah - has shown more love for [this] fear than one who does the commandment itself. As the doing of the commandments does not prove fear like the one who observes the fences, since he is careful from the start not to come to error. However, the one who does the commandment but does not observe the fence shows us that if it is good in his eyes to do the commandment, [yet] it is not bad in his eyes if he errs in it; and that he is not concerned about the fear that he will make a breach in it, and 'one who makes a breach will be bitten by a snake.' Behold that the words of the sages, may their memory be blessed, are pillars and 'trees' in the fear of Heaven; which is a foundation of the world and a fundamental principle of virtue. And all of the commandments are appetizers for it, as they said in the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 1), "'For your love is more delightful than wine' (Song of Songs 1:2) - the words of the scribes are more beloved than the wine of Torah."

Mishna 2

<b>Shimon the Righteous was from the remnants of the Great Assembly.</b> And he was a high priest, as they said in Tractate Tamid 21 (Yoma 69a) that he had gone out dressed with the priestly garments in front of Alexander [the Great] and [Alexander] went down and bowed before him. His servants said to him, "Our master, A king like you should bow down to this Jew?" He said [back] to them, "I see the image of this one in war and I am victorious."
<b>He would say, "On three things the world stands":</b> This means to say that because of these things the world was created. As below (Avot 1:18), it states, "On three the things the world subsists," and they are not those that it mentions here. Hence, we need to explain that when they said "stands," it means that the world was created for them, since they are the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. This means to say that the world was created for His creatures that in the future would fulfill His will in front of Him through these things. And these three are a great pillar, such that on account of them, we are able to get to all of the [other] things that the sages, may their memory be blessed, said that the world stands because of them.
<b>"On the Torah":</b> As it stated about it (as it is stated) (Proverbs 11:27), "He who seeks what is good pursues what is pleasing." And good is only Torah, and because of it the world was created, as it is stated (Jeremiah 33:25), "Were it not for My covenant, night and day[, etc.]. And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, said, (Proverbs 8:22), "The Lord created me at the beginning of His course, as the first of His works of old" - I was created before the whole world and because of me, all of the creations were created - in order to observe me. 
<b>"on the service":</b> As the Holy One, blessed be He, chose Israel from all of the nations and the Land of Israel from all of the lands, and He chose Jerusalem from all of the Land of Israel and He chose Zion from Jerusalem, as it is stated (Psalms 132:13), "As the Lord chose Zion, He desired it for His habitation." And He chose the House of Choice from everything for the sake of the service, about which it is written, "desire" - as it states (Leviticus 1:3), "desirous in front of God." Behold that because of the service the whole world was created. Then, due to our sins, the Temple was destroyed and the service was annulled. And prayer is now for us in its place, as the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Taanit 2a), "'And to serve him with all your hearts' (Deuteronomy 11:13) - what service is there in the heart, one should say this is prayer." And this is what it states (Psalms 51:17), "Lord, open my lips," as King David said this verse about the sin of Batsheva which was volitional, and one cannot bring a sacrifice for volitional sins. And about this he stated (Psalms 51:18), "Since You do not want me to bring sacrifices; You do not desire burnt offerings." Had I been able to bring a sacrifice to atone for myself, I would have brought [it]. Now that I cannot, 'Lord, open my lips and let my mouth say your praise,' and accept my prayer in place of a sacrifice and let it atone me for my sin. Also for us that do not have a sacrifice to atone for us - not accidental sins and not volitional sins - 'Lord, open my lips' and accept our prayers in place of the sacrifices.  
<b>"and on acts of lovingkindness"</b> As the matter that they said (Sukkah 49b), "Acts of lovingkindness are greater than charity (<i>tsedekah</i>); since lovingkindness is both with the poor and with the wealthy but charity is only with the poor. Great is lovinkindness since it is both with one's body and with one's money, but charity is only with one's money."  And this is what they said, (Bava Batra 9a), "One who gives a small coin to a poor man is blessed in six ways and and one who comforts him with words is blessed in eleven." And pertinent to acts of lovingkindness is to inspect the poor and to make a distinction between the good and the bad and to give preference to the modest and those that fear God over others who are not like them (even if we must give charity to all). And it is like Yirmiyahu, peace be upon him, stated (Jeremiah 18:23), "let them be made to stumble before You; act against them in Your hour of wrath!" - even in the time that they do charity, make them stumble that they should give it in the incorrect place. And acts of lovingkindness are even to the wealthy, to lend them money at a time when it is not found in their hand and to give them advice, as King Shlomo said, (Proverbs 27:9), "Oil and incense gladden the heart, but the sweetness of a friend is better than one’s own counsel." [This] is to say, just like oil and incense gladden the heart, so [too] does one 's friend become delighted by personal advice; and when he gives him good advice, he is gladdened by it. And this trait of kindness brings God's satisfaction in front of Him, and for it was the world created - in order to do it. And about it Shlomo said in his wisdom (Proverbs 14:34), "Righteousness exalts a nation; Sin is a reproach to any people" - and adjacent to it, "The king favors a capable servant" - the will of the Holy One, blessed be He is only for Israel, who investigate [how] to do the things that are desirable in front of Him.

Mishna 3

<b>Antigonos, man of Sokho, etc., "Do not be as servants who are serving the master in order to receive a reward":</b> As this is not complete service, as he is not doing it for his master, but [rather] in order to receive a reward.
<b>"Rather be as servants who are serving the master in order not to receive a reward":</b> (Editor's note: In my opinion, here there should be the words, "And it is difficult according to this textual variant.") Since a person should not do the commandment with the understanding that he will not receive a reward for them. But rather the [correct] textual variant is "not in order to receive a reward" - that he should not do the commandments for the sake of the reward, even though he should think that there will be recompense for his service. However, it appears to me that the variant of the books is the main one [that we should follow]: As we find such service among people, such that a purchased slave is obligated to do service without receiving reward. So too, a man must serve God in order not to receive a reward, but rather because of the kindness that He has already performed for him. And also due to the greatness of the Master, that He is fitting for this, and this is the service of God - may He be blessed and elevated - from love, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:5), "And you shall love the Lord." And what is complete service among people? One who wants to serve his friend because of his love for him from earlier days, and even if he knows that he will not give him a reward. And [with] this type of love should a person love the service of God. And therefore, [the Mishnah] placed it adjacent to the matter of fear and stated,
<b>"and may the fear of Heaven be upon you":</b> To serve God from fear and from love, like a servant that serves his master because of his greatness and [also] keeps in mind that he can punish him. And it comes out that he serves him from fear - not because of his fear from the punishment, but [rather] because of the greatness of the master, whereby he has the ability to punish.

Mishna 4

<b>Yose ben Yoezer, man of Tsreida, and Yose ben Yochanan, man of Jerusalem, received from him:</b> From Shimon the Righteous and Antigonos, man of Sokho 
<b>Yose ben Yoezer says, "May your house be a meeting house for Sages":</b> It means to say, a house that the sages will gather there when they need to speak, one with the other. And this can only be in the house of a great and important man. As were it in the house of a lesser man, when they would say to the sage to go there, perhaps he would not want, since [for] him, 'a base one is disgraceful in his eyes; and he does not honor those that fear the Lord.'   
<b>"become dirty in the dust of their feet":</b> That he treat them with honor, as it was their way to stand in front of the sage. And some of them would sit on benches in the house of study and some of them would sit in front of them on the floor at the dust of their feet, as they said (Chullin 54a), "All the days that that student apprenticed in sitting, I apprenticed in standing." And this is what he stated: Be honored among all of the creatures, but honor the sages.
<b>"and drink their words thirstily":</b> And this is like it is stated (Proverbs 27:7), "A sated person disdains honey, but to a hungry man anything bitter seems sweet." The soul of one who is sated from words of Torah and does not desire them will disdain them - even if they tell him pearls of Torah. But one who is hungry for them, and desires to hear them, will find them sweet in his mouth and will be happy about it - even if he is told something without an explanation - since he knows that it is true, as his teacher said it.

Mishna 5

<b>Yose ben Yochanan, man of Jerusalem, says, "May your home be open wide":</b> Some say that [this means that] there be largess found in his house for needy people. Or the explanation is that his house be like the house of our father Avraham, peace be upon him - such that his house be on the road in a tight spot so that passers by should come in to there; and that it should be open on four sides, so that from all sides that they come, they will find an open door and they will turn into it, as Job stated (Job 31:32), "I opened my doors to the road." 
<b>"may the poor be members of your household":</b> This is expounded in two ways. Instead of buying slaves and supporting them, he should use poor people and support them and he will not need to expend money. So that it comes out that he will profit and do a commandment (good deed). Another explanation: And also that the poor will be accustomed to his house and stay there without embarrassment, as  a result of his showing them a happy face and giving them permission to everything that is his, like a man would give to his children and to the people of his home.
<b>"and do not increase conversation with the woman":</b> As conversation with women brings one to thoughts of sin and neglect of Torah [study].
<b>They so stated with his wife; all the more so with the wife of his friend.</b> (Our master and teacher [Rashi] wrote, "As it is written in the Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan), "They said [this] about his menstruant wife, all the more so regarding the wife of his fellow." It means to say, that he not increase words with his menstruant wife, lest his impulse overcomes him and he comes to a mishap; and all the more so with the wife of his fellow, about whom his impulse pressures him even more. As if they said it with the one that will be permissible for him tomorrow - and it appears to him like 'bread in his basket' - all the more so with another woman, whom the impulse desires, as the matter that it stated (Proverbs 9:17), "stolen waters are sweet." But it appears to be explained according to its simple meaning, "They so stated with his wife," not to ever accustom her to [many] words, so that she not be found with him every day. As a man should not be with his wife for his pleasure, but [rather] to fulfill the commandment; so as to distinguish between man and beast, as they said in Tractate Berakhot 22a concerning a man with a nocturnal emission, "So that they not be with their wives like chickens." And that is the trait of separation which brings one to the highest levels, as we say (Avodah Zarah 20b), "Separation brings to purity."
<b>From this, the sages said, "Any time that a man increases conversation with the woman, he causes evil to himself":</b> [This] is to say, he causes the impulse that is called evil to overpower him, as we say (Kiddushin 30b), "Great is the evil impulse, that its Creator calls it evil, as it is stated (Genesis 8:21), 'since the devisings of man’s mind are evil from his youth.'" And this man caused evil to himself, as he gave it a place and an invitation to cling to himself, by way of conversation [with women]. And he went beyond the traits of other men, as the impulse sometimes overpowers them [also]; but without them doing something to cause [it], and it is not their own doing that brought the evil to begin with them.
<b>"and neglects the words of Torah:"</b> As the thought of Torah is not firm in his eyes so long as his heart is focused on the woman and upon her conversation, as they are two thoughts that the heart does not tolerate together.
<b>"and, in his end, he inherits Geihinam":</b> As in the end, he comes to sin: Since he follows the whims of his heart and increases words, certainly (Editor's note: It appears that instead of "<i>al panim</i>" (certainly?), [it should be] with the woman - see Midrash Shmuel) he will sin and descend to the pit. And this is what Shlomo - peace be upon him - stated (Ecclesiastes 7:26), "I find woman more bitter than death; she is all traps, her heart is snares and her hands are fetters." This means to say that death removes him from the world - from the small life of the world - but woman destroys his soul for ever and ever. Behold, 'she is more bitter than death.' "She is all traps and snares": When a man observes a woman, he is caught in her net, which is her trap, and he cannot escape from her. As the man sees that which his heart desires and he does not see what will happen to him from her in the end of days. As the lyricist (R. Yehudah HaLevi) said, "The seduced dove travels in the wilderness; it sees the grain but it does not see the trap." "Her heart is snares" - when she desires a man in her heart, even if he does not desire her and it is [just] the bad fortune of this man that caused her to desire him. "Her hands are fetters" - because if she grabs him with her hands, he is already taken into the 'prison' and he no longer has a way to fix it. "He who is pleasing to God escapes her, and he who is displeasing is caught by her" (Ecclesiastes 7:26) as the Holy One, blessed be He, protects the righteous and does not present them something through which they might stumble; but the sinner, who does not distance himself from evil paths and whose heart is not complete, chances upon a matter like this. 

Mishna 6

<b>Yehoshua ben Perachiah and Nitai of Arbel received from them:</b> From Yose ben Yoezer and Yosef ben Yochanan.
<b>Yehoshua ben Perachia says, "Make for yourself a mentor, acquire for yourself a friend":</b> As even if you know [as much] as him, make him a mentor upon you, since a person remembers better what he learned from his mentor than what a person learned on his own. And also because sometimes he will understand a thing better and it will come out that he will teach him - even as they are both equal in wisdom. 
<b>"Make for yourself a mentor":</b> A person needs three things from a good friend. One is for words of Torah, as it stated (Taanit 7a), "I have learned much from my teachers and more from my friends than from my teachers." And the second is for commandments. As even if his friend is not more pious than he and there are times that he does what is not in order. [Yet it is only] when he derives pleasure from something that he does the sin, but it is not his desire and his will that his friend do it - as he derives no enjoyment from this. And it is like they said (Kiddushin 63b), "And a man will not sin if it is not for himself." It comes out that both of them will repent, each one according to the word of his friend. And the third is regarding advice that he can take, that he be 'more than a city for help' in all of his affairs and to take good counsel from him and to be his confidant. Since he is his ally, he will not reveal [his secrets] to others so as not to confound his plan - and not even to those that appear to him to be friends; for is the appearance of love evident on their faces? And about this Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 15:22), "Plans are foiled for want of counsel, but they succeed through many advisers." And that which he said, <b>"acquire for yourself a friend"</b> with an expression of [acquisition] (euphemism) is [to say] that if he does not find him for free, he should acquire him with his money and expend his assets in order to get to a good friend; or that he should acquire him with words of appeasement and with a soft way of talking. And [so] he should not be exacting about his words and he should tolerate the words of his mouth; even when he says something against him, he should not return a response. As without this, he will not keep [the friendship], since the opinions [of people] are different. And sometimes he will seek something, [but] his friend who is like himself will say, "See, I do not [consider] this to be fit." And if he doesn't [listen to his friend] (he will certainly pass him up), the [friendship] will unravel. And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 17:9), "He who seeks love covers errors, but he who harps on a matter alienates a leader." He meant to say, one who covers when his friend errs, seeks love - as through this, their love is preserved, as he tolerates his errors. But if he harps about the matter with his friend, he speaks against him and repeats it and says, "See what this one said; what he said about me, he 'alienates the leader' - he(certainly) alienates his leader from him, meaning to say, his friend.  
<b>"and judge every person as meritorious":</b> This is speaking about a person about whom we do not know if he is righteous or if he is evil; or if we know that he is a moderate person, sometimes doing evil and sometimes doing good. And if he does something that can make us judge him unfavorably and [also] judge him favorably in our understanding - or even if, (towards) according to what appears, it leans more towards the side of guilt - if he can judge him favorably from one aspect of the matter, he should say, "His intentions were good." But these words are not [applicable] to the completely righteous or the completely evil. As with the righteous person, even with an action that is completely evil and leans toward guilt in every aspect, we should judge him favorably and say, "'It was a mistake that came out from the hand of the ruler,' and behold he regretted and observed [it] and [already] requested forgiveness." And it is like the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 19a), "If you see a Torah scholar who sinned at night, do not ruminate about him during the day, lest he has repented. 'Lest' comes into your mind? But rather, I will say he certainly repented." The explanation of  "'Lest' comes into your mind?" is that since he is a Torah scholar and up until now, no corrupt thing has come to his hand; he certainly repented right away. You behold [from here that] one should never judge the perfectly righteous person unfavorably. And about him there is no reason to say,  "judge every person as meritorious." And he also did not speak about the completely evil person. Even if his actions are completely good and it is not evident to be concerned about him regarding an angle of iniquity, a person should judge him unfavorably and say, "He did it on the surface 'and his inside is not like his outside.'" And it is like it is stated (Proverbs 26:25), "Though he be fair-spoken do not trust him, for seven abominations are in his heart." And so [too] wrote Rambam, may his memory be blessed. And about this Shlomo stated in his wisdom (Proverbs 21:12), "The righteous one observes the house of the wicked man; he subverts the wicked to the bad." He meant to say, people think that because the righteous do not know how to do evil, [hence] they do not recognize they ways of the evil - as they do not understand those that do it. And the matter is not like this, as 'the righteous one observes the house of the wicked,' and knows and recognizes and monitors the evil of his ways more than other people who know [about it], but don't pay attention to it. "He subverts the wicked to the bad" - when the righteous person sees the action of the evildoers which appear to be in a good path, he subverts it and pushes it towards his judgment to say that he has done wrong - since he did not intend [to do] a commandment, but rather to place himself among those assumed to be good. 

Mishna 7

<b>Nitai of Arbel says: "Distance [yourself] from a bad neighbor":</b> He said it to renters of houses and purchasers of slaves. As when a person first asks about the house and the tightness of the place, he should ask about the neighbors - if they are evil, he should distance himself from them, and he should come close to the good ones.
<b>"do not befriend an evildoer":</b> As it [brings] a great punishment, which has nothing like it. Since if he transgress a great sin, he did one sin; but this one has a portion in all of the sins that the evildoer does. And it comes out that he does many great and huge sins. And [even] if his hands are tied and he does not benefit from them, woe to the evildoer and woe to his neighbor - as 'he sins and his neighbor is flogged.' As so is it explained in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan 30:3, "Anyone who clings to evildoers - even though he does not do like their deeds - takes recompense like them; and one who clings to the righteous - even though he does not do like their deeds - takes recompense like them." And about this it is stated (II Chronicles 20:37), "“As you have made a partnership, etc., the Lord will break up your work.” 
<b>"and do not despair":</b> He made these two things adjacent and said, "do not befriend an evildoer," because you need not despair from punishment. And do not say in your heart, "He is still standing in tranquility and times [are good] for him - I will befriend him and when his good fortune changes, I will distance myself from him." And you cannot [do this], as you will not know what [each new] day will bring, and his time will come in an instant, and you will be taken with him; when he begins to fall, he and all of his friends will fall. And also do not say, "I will show him love outwardly, but I will not love him in my heart." As it is also evil for you to flatter him, since it is a sin to flatter evildoers in this world. And about this matter Shlomo stated (Proverbs 24:21-22), "Fear the Lord, my son, and the king, and do not mix with changers. For their time comes suddenly; the doom of both, who can foreknow?" The explanation is that he made adjacent the fear of the Lord (my son, and the king) to the fear of a flesh and blood king as a metaphor relating the fear of the body [from] that which is perceived by the eye with the fear of the soul [from] that which is invisible. And he said when you see that the king hates all those who love his enemies and that he metes out bad to him, asks who is it that filled his heart to love the enemy of the king, and does to him [the same thing] that he does to his enemy; [know that] so [too] the Holy One, blessed be He, does to all those who mix with the changers - that is to say, those that change the Torah and the commandments. As [the word] 'change' here is transitive, as in (Job 29:22), "After my word, [things] were not changed." And when the changers are struck, their friends will also be collected with them - 'Should one give aid to the wicked and befriend those who hate the Lord? For this, it shall be upon you.' "As his time comes suddenly" and you will not be able to escape for your life. "And the doom of both, who can foreknow," meaning to say, the doom of the king's hater and the doom of the hater of the Holy One, blessed be He. Who knows when it will come to them, and [so] no man can be careful to befriend them and to save his [own] life.

Mishna 8

<b>Yehuda ben Tabai and Shimon ben Shetach received from them:</b> From Yehoshua ben Perachiah and Nitai of Arbel.
<b>Yehuda ben Tabai says, "Do not make yourself like the judges' advisers (<i>orkhei</i>)":</b> He means to say a head, as it is stated in Bereshit Rabbah 23:10, "'And Efron was sitting among the children of Chet' (Genesis 23:10) - on that very day, they appointed him <i>arkhi</i>," meaning to say the head of the judges. And also in the section of "Yaakov sent messengers" (Parshat Vayishlach, Bereshit Rabbah 75:3), "<i>arkhi</i>" is the head of the thieves. And also in Arukh, you will find that <i>arkhi</i> is explained like this there. And the explanation of this is, do not make yourself like the judge's advisers, that [people] should ask you and you tell them the laws; and after they hear it from you, they go to other judges for judgment and they say to them, "The head of the judges has already told us that this is the law." Do not make yourself like them. And from Rambam there is another explanation: <b>"Do not make yourself like the judges' advisers"</b> - He did (not) speak here about someone who teaches false claims to his friend and how to present them, since such a person is completely evil. And it is not necessary to say that a person not do this on account that they will suspect him and speak badly about him, as this is a great sin [and nothing more need be said about it]. Rather, [it is one] that organizes the claims [of someone] and arranges the laws and reveals the verdict [of a case] to an individual - as it is not fitting to do this since they will suspect him and speak badly about him. This [is] like that story of Rabbi Yochanan in Tractate Ketuvot 52b, wherein at the beginning he reasoned, "do not ignore your flesh" (Isaiah 58:7), and at the end he reasoned, it is different with an important man.
<b>"and when the litigants are before you, they should be like evildoers in your eyes":</b> That your heart should not lean towards one of them, and that you not think that he is (righteous) in his case. As if so, you will never judge a case truthfully, since your heart is unfettered towards this one, and you will not be able to see his  guilt. Rather they should be in your eyes as if they were both evil and making false claims. And let not your heart lean to one of them, so that the matter come under the correct light.
<b>"and when they are excused from before you, they should be meritorious in your eyes - when they have accepted the judgment":</b> This is a measure of piety, since you know that one of them made a false claim. [Still,] he should not be in your eyes (ever) assumed to be a liar and a difficult litigant. And it is not fitting to suspect him, since he accepted the verdict upon himself and left the court guilty. And one should think that he repented and he doesn't have in mind to do this [again] all the days of his life.

Mishna 9

<b>Shimon ben Shatach says, "Examine the witnesses thoroughly":</b> To examine and cross-examine them many times. And through this you will reveal the secret, since 'with many words sin will not be averted' and he will learn from their words if they are testifying falsely.
<b>"but be careful with your words, lest from them they learn to lie":</b> As when you examine them about a matter, you can speak your words [in such a way] that they will understand in what way they will be found guilty in their trial and learn from your words what lies they need to make to win [the case].

Mishna 10

<b>Shemayah and Avtalyon received from them. Shemayah says, "Love work":</b> So that a man not be idle from work, since idleness brings a person to ennui (Ketuvot 59b); and that is a trait of illness, as it is stated about it (Proverbs 21:25), "The craving of a lazy man kills him, for his hands refuse to do." It means to say, when he accustoms his limbs to be idle from work, his hands refuse, since habit rules over them. And it also states about it (Proverbs 20:4), "From the winter the lazy man does not plow; at harvesttime he seeks, and there is nothing." As he thinks when he is idle from work that it is rest for him, but it is the opposite; as [it is] with exertion [that] he will have rest. As with the winter he will rest and stay in his house and not plow and seek to reap and gather the grain [when] there is none and die of hunger. But the one who plows in the winter - 'he who tills his land will be sated with bread,' as a man cannot reach rest without exertion first. 'But he who pursues vanities' and pursues the ones that sit in the corners idle from work 'will be sated with poverty.'
<b>"hate lordship":</b> He made this adjacent to the activity of work, as they are one topic - that he hate lordship and the advantage of the idle ones, as their end is to to come to the trait of poverty. But [rather] he should be involved in his work the whole day, as it said (Pesachim 113a), "Flay a carcass in the marketplace and eat [from] your wage, and do not say, 'I am a priest, I am an important man.'" And about this Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 12:9), "Better to be a lowly one and a servant to himself than to be honored and have no food." And the explanation of "lowly one" is not like its literal understanding, but rather it is the opposite of honored lordship.
<b>"and do not become familiar with the government":</b> As service for the government is very difficult. And regardless, once he accepts the yoke of the king, his end is to break the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven and to refrain from this commandment. Since he will be afraid of the government and his work will be extensive, he will make the service of God a farce in the face of this work. And also at the end, they will strip him of his assets without gain, as they only bring someone close for their own purpose. And regardless, once he accepts the yoke of a king of flesh and blood at one time, he can not [longer] do that which the Master requires.

Mishna 11

<b>Avtalyon says, "Sages, be careful with your words, lest you become obligated in an obligation of exile</b> Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote in a correct way in his commentary on Avot: "Be careful with your words," to explain your words so that you not leave room for [heresy], <b>"lest you become obligated in an obligation of exile and are exiled to the place of evil waters"</b> - the place of heretics that reveal the faces of Torah that are not appropriate, and extract from your words, things that are not so. 
<b>"and the students who follow after you will drink"</b> As they will hear your words and not understand and rely upon the words of the heretics who explain your words according to their opinions, and they will reason that this was your opinion, <b>"and thus the name of Heaven is profaned."</b>

Mishna 12

<b>Hillel and Shammai received from them:</b> From Shemayah and Avtalyon. 
<b>Hillel says, "Be of the disciples of Aharon, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving the creatures and bringing them closer to Torah."</b> He means to say that he loves truth and peace in his heart and pursues it with the actions of his hands. As there are people that love it in their hearts that don't trouble themselves to bring peace to the world and don't walk in the paths of peace. But those that do actions and bring peace between a man and his friend and love to do this work - as it is stated (Psalms 34:15), "seek peace and pursue it" - those are from the students of Aharon, who would act like this.
<b>"loving the creatures and bringing them closer to Torah":</b> When Aharon would sense that a person had sinned in private, he would go to him and befriend him and make him into his friend. And the sinner would put in his heart that if Aharon would know the hidden matters in my heart, would he ever want my friendship? Rather, it is that I am assumed by him to be a proper man and one who does the commandments. However if he knew my bad thought, he would distance himself from me - from befriending an evildoer like me today. And [so] he would regret his evil and contemplate repentance. And this is very effective and beneficial for him in undoing his evil thought, as is is stated (Malachi 2:6), "He walked with Me in peace and righteousness, and brought many back from iniquity."

Mishna 13

<b>He would say, "Spread a name, lose his name:"</b> He means to say, a man that is proud and his name goes out in the world due to his pride and his greatness and he makes for himself a name 'like the names of the world's greats' in opposition to the great Name that is permanent in pride; this way, will he lose his name in a great loss and he will not be remembered and he will not be counted. 
<b>And one who does not increase [knowledge] ceases (<i>yasef</i>)"</b> One who is wise but does not want to add wisdom to his wisdom and says in his heart, "I have already learned all of the Torah entirely and I have seen its ways and its paths. What is there for me in this pain to trouble myself in my fleeting days and what [more] is there  for me to understand that I have not understood?" May it be His will that this man should die and be gathered (<i>yeasef</i>) to his people. And why should he live [any] more, since he has already gotten up from studying?
<b>"And one who does not study is liable to die":</b> One who has not studied at all is compared to a beast. As why was he created in the world? To understand and give ruling of the Torah, whose 'ways are ways of pleasantness. And it is not fitting that the one that never learned Torah and continues to maintain his evil [this way] live even one day and even one hour.  
<b>"And one who makes use of the crown [of learning] passes away":</b> Behold the one who gets honor from the crown of Torah and benefits from its honor and and makes it like a means to accomplish his needs, perishes, as it is learned later (Avot 4:5), "Do not make it [the Torah] into a crown with which to aggrandize yourself, and not into a spade with which to dig into them. And thus Hillel used to say: And one who makes use of the crown [of learning] passes away." 

Mishna 14

<b>He [Hillel] used to say: If I am not for me, who will be for me?</b> If I don't rebuke myself to be assiduous about the commandments, who is there to rebuke me and make me assiduous? Since the prompting of others is [only] good on a temporary basis. But when the person motivates himself each and every day, he increases to think of thoughts in order to do the work of God. And there is no forgetting before him, when his heart desires [it], and it is a straight path in front of a person. 
<b>And when I am for myself alone, what am I?</b> I still cannot reach one thousandth of what I am obligated to do. And they made a parable [about this]: To what is the thing similar? To a king that gave his field to his servants and agreed with them [that his portion would be] thirty <i>kor</i>. They toiled and they brought him five <i>kor</i>. The king said to them, "But didn't I agree with you that it be thirty <i>kor</i>?" They said to him, "Our master, the king, the field that you gave us was of low quality. We toiled greatly on it and we were not able to get out from it more than five <i>kor</i>." So did they say in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, "It is the evil impulse that you have given us from our youth, as it is stated (Genesis 8:21), 'the impulse of man’s heart is evil from his youth.' And even when a man toils greatly to do what is straight in the eyes of God, a man only accomplishes a small part of what he is obligated to do." And this is what is stated (Psalms 103:14), "For He knows our impulse; He is mindful that we are dust." Since were it not that He made the evil impulse [powerful] in man - even without his working hard and pursuing the commandments - he would do many of them. [It would be] like in a high quality field - even if they did not toil in the work of his land - something would come out of it. But now that he knows that even if he toils greatly, he will only attain a small amount because of the evil impulse that corrupts his body; [then] all the more so if he does not toil, his soul will remain empty of the commandments, like a poor quality field if one does not toil in it. And if he does not fertilize it and plow it, nothing will come out of it. And about this is it stated (Proverbs 24:30-31), "I passed by the field of a lazy man, by the vineyard of a man lacking sense. It was all overgrown with thorns; its surface was covered with chickweed, and its stone fence lay in ruins." And for this reason he made the motivation of others adjacent to the motivation of himself and said, " If I am not for me, who will be for me," but if I don't toil and motivate myself to pursue the commandments, I will stay devoid of them - since, even "when I am for myself" and toil in them, I only reach a small portion of the many portions and what do I reach (<i>mah ani</i> can mean both "what am I" and what do I) if I don't toil at all?
<b>And if not now, then when?</b> Such that he not say, I will occupy myself with my work today and tomorrow I will turn to and occupy myself with self-improvement. Since maybe he will not turn to [it]. And even if he does turn to [it], that day went, left and he removed it from the work of God. And he will not be able to make it up all the days of his life, since he is obligated to improve himself and to be occupied by the commandment all of the days that he is living upon the [earth], and he does not have the right to avoid this work - not even for a moment. And there is also included in this expression, "If not now," in the days of my youth, "then when?" If I leave it until my old age and hoariness, I will not be able to do it. And about this matter, David, peace be upon him, stated (Psalms 144:12), "For our sons are like saplings, well-tended in their youth." He meant to say that when the sapling is small, a person can grow it to be a straight tree and not be crooked. However after it grows crooked, it is very difficult to fix. And so [too] when a person is still young, it is easy for him to be on a good path and to turn from evil, but when he grows old with his evil, it is difficult in his eyes to leave it, as it is written (Proverbs 22:6), "Teach a lad according to his way; also when he will grow old, he not swerve from it." And it is [also] written (Deuteronomy 20:19), "since a man is a tree of the field." And also because repentance in old age is not full repentance. Since at that time, the impulse is not strong and desire is benign and the soul does not enjoy - and he does not desire - sinful pleasures. And this is the reason for his repentance. And about this matter is it stated (Ecclesiastes 12:1), "And remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before those days of bad come and those years arrive of which you will say, 'I have no desire in them.'"

Mishna 15

<b>Shammai says, "Make your Torah fixed":</b> As they said in The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan 28:10, "Anyone who makes his Torah [study] primary and his work secondary is made primary in the world to come. And anyone that makes his Torahs [study] secondary and his work primary will be made secondary in the world to come. This means to say, even though he did not do a sin, but he did not make Torah primary - even if he was (fit) to be in the Garden of Eden, he will be secondary there. 
<b>"say little and do much":</b> When you promise your friend to do something for him, tell him a little and do much for him, and that is in the way of ethics and piety. And we have learned [it] from our father Avraham, peace be upon him, as it is written (Genesis 18:5), "And let me fetch a morsel of bread"; and afterwards (Genesis 18:8), "And he took curds and milk and the calf, etc." Another explanation: "say little and do much" - and that is a lofty virtue. And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, learned it from the blessed Holy One, blessed be He, who only promised with two letters, as it is stated (Genesis 15:14), "I will judge (<i>dan</i>, a word which is written with only two letters); and delivered them with twenty seven words, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:14), "Or has any god ventured to go and take for himself one nation from the midst of another, etc." And about this Rabbi Saadia Gaon, my his memory be blessed, said, "If in promising our fathers with two letters, he did for them many miracles and wonders; [with] the salvation in the future to come about which have been written many pages and many manuscripts and many books of promises and many consolations in Jeremiah in the Prophets, how much the more so will it be that His actions will be more wondrous than that which He promised - 'our soul knows this well.' And a person should know and consider the matter and to put into his heart that there will be a great reward for him because of the promises" (HaEmunot veHaDeot 8:1). 
<b>"and receive every person with a pleasant countenance":</b> That he show them a happy face, so that 'the spirit of creations find pleasure from him.' Another explanation: "and receive" - that he should distance himself from the trait of anger which is a very bad trait and conduct himself with the trait of good will, in such a way that people will be satisfied with him. [This is] proper and well-accepted. About this our sages, may their memory be blessed, said in the way of ethical teachings, "Do you want to be liked? Like that which you don't like." As a person cannot accomplish that the people of the world will like him if he does not forego his traits. And if he does not forego his wants for the sake of their wants, he must negate his will for the sake of the will of others. And with this, he will have many friends and guard himself from the injuries of people. As they will hate and seek to hurt one who shows them an angry face. 

Mishna 16

<b>Rabban Gamliel says, "Make for yourself a mentor, remove yourself from doubt":</b> He means to say that he should take his colleague as his mentor - even though he is not more wise than he, and even if he has not even reached [the first one's] wisdom - in order that he remove himself from doubt. And in Talmud Yerushalmi Moed Katan 1:10, it states, "Go and and bring me an elder from the marketplace and I will rely upon him and permit [it] to you." As there are times when a sage will be in doubt about a ruling and he will not know what to say: If he permits, maybe it is forbidden and a mishap will occur through him; and if he forbids what is permitted, it will come out that he will cause a loss of money to Israel, whereas the Torah is concerned about it. Therefore, he should make his colleague a mentor and ask him about his questions. And he will make the ruling upon his mouth, even if the matter is simple to him and even if it is a permissive ruling, even when he is not as great as he in wisdom. And thus did the Geonim say, "In anything where it is a doubt to one and clear to the other, the law is like the one to whom it is clear, even [if it is] a student before his mentor."
<b>"and do not frequently tithe by estimation":</b> That he not tithe his fruits by estimation. If he wants to tithe what he has measured out generously [to be] more than the tenth, it comes out that [that which is beyond the tenth] is [still] <i>tevel</i> (a forbidden mixture that requires separation to render it permissible) that is not tithed until he puts his eyes to it to tithe it, and it comes out that there is a corruption of this tithe. And this matter is a metaphor for the matter of reasoning, in which a person should not do it by estimation, but rather in the way of principles and to come to full knowledge. And this is not the case with all reasonings. As there is one that is nuanced and the sage - even though his reasoning leans to the side that he understands - recognizes that another sage can [see] it in a different way. It is just that [his way] looks more [correct] in his eyes. And there is [another] reasoning that a sage innovates and recognizes and knows that it is logically correct and necessary,  has no other angles and that no other sage would disagree. And the one who understands will understand [this]. And for this [reason] was this matter made adjacent to [the teaching], "Make for yourself a mentor, remove yourself from doubt" - as [the two teachings] are [based on] almost the same rationale.

Mishna 17

<b>Shimon, his son, says, "All my days I grew up among the Sages":</b> And I have observed and considered all of the important traits.
<b>"and I did not find anything better for the body than silence":</b> Rambam, may his memory be blessed, already explained about the matter of silence that if it was about speech that brings damage to a person in every way or that brings gain from one side but damage from the other, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would not have needed to warn us about it - as every person who guards himself from anguish would be careful about it. But rather, even with speech that brings no damage to a person at all and is all gain, like one who speaks about his business affairs and the needs of his body and the needs of his livelihood - one must minimize speech and not be long-winded in it, but rather [just speak] according to his need. And it is not necessary to say about a vain matter that does not [change a thing] that one should not mention it at all. And so [too] did they say in Talmud Yerushalmi Berakhot 1:2, "Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, 'If I had been at Mount Sinai, I would have needed two mouths.' Afterwards he said, 'Now that we only have one, I am not able to save our souls from evil speech, all the more so if we had two.'" He means to say [he wanted two mouths] so that he should not speak from his [one] mouth words of Torah and words that are completely vain things of the world; in the same [way] that our holy sages would make themselves like vessels of [the sacrificial] service, which are not to be used for profane matters. And this is that which we say in the Talmud of the Westerners (Talmud Yerushalmi Berakhot 9:5), "All  chatter (<i>patatia</i>) is bad except for Torah chatter which is good." And some have the version, "All <i>karavia</i> is bad except for Torah <i>karavia</i> which is good." And the meaning of <i>karavia</i> is plowing. [This is] to say that all of the words and thoughts with which a person makes efforts in this world, 'it is all vain and bad spirit, besides thoughts about Torah and 'the acts of God, as [they are] awesome.'
<b>"And the exposition [of Torah] is not what is essential, but the action":</b> [This is] saying that one should not expostulate on a commandment to others while he does not do it [himself]. Rather, he should do them first and [then] teach them to others - as the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Tosefta Yevamot 9:5), "Pleasant are words that come out of the mouth of one who practices them."
 <b>"And whoever increases words brings sin."</b> This matter is speaking about words of Torah, as a person should not increase [words] of law, but rather wait and think out what he will say, [such that] his words be measured and they not be hasty. As 'when there are many words, transgression will not be avoided,' as he will think the matter is like this and he will bring sin with his [mistaken] ruling. And hence they said, "And the exposition [of Torah] is not what is essential, but the action," to make known that [that statement] is speaking abut words of Torah. And this [statement] as well should not be explained to be about vanities of the world - as if [had been] so, they should have made it adjacent (to) "and I did not find anything better for the body than silence," as that is about mundane words. And then immediately it [should] say, "And whoever increases words brings sin." But rather they said it about words of Torah, as we have explained. 

Mishna 18

<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "On three things the world subsists: on judgment":</b> That he should judge a truthful judgment. 
<b>"on truth":</b> As a person should walk in the paths of repentance - as He is true and His Torah is true - and walk in the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He, of truth. And he should also go in that path, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 28:9), "and you shall go in His ways." And the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 63a) that even in the recounting of mundane words should a person not lie, like that story of Rav's son, etc.: [Rav] said to him,"Your mother has improved." He said [back] to him, "It is I that reversed [your words to bring about the change]." He said, "This is as people say, 'The one that comes from you will teach you reason.' But you should not do this because of that which is stated (Jeremiah 9:4), 'they taught their mouths to speak words of falsehood.'" For a person who accustoms his tongue to speak falsehood about a matter that has neither a loss nor gain will - when he comes to speak matters of principle - also not be able to speak the truth; as it is his mouth that will speak and habit rules over it.
<b>and on peace":</b> Peace includes all good things in the world, and there is no end to its benefits. And [may there be] peace upon Israel. 

Perek 2



Mishna 1

<b>Rabbi [Yehuda haNasi] said: Which is the straight path that a person should choose for himself? Whichever [path] that is [itself] praiseworthy for the person adopting [it], And praiseworthy to him from [other] people:</b> When the commandments are done, the Holy One, blessed be He, is made praiseworthy through them and that is true praiseworthiness for people. And therefore, one should choose this path for himself.
<b>And praiseworthy to him from [other] people:</b> That he do the commandments in their [appropriate] time, as it is stated (Proverbs 15:23), "and how good is a thing in its time." As he can do [them] in a time that is not right in the eyes of the creatures and it will not attain praiseworthiness from them. And that is not doing the complete commandment; as the matter that the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 63a), "Anyone who does a commandment according to its statement nullifies even a decreed judgment of seventy years, as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 8:4), 'Inasmuch as a king’s command is authoritative, and none can say to him, “What are you doing?,” and it is written after it, 'One who obeys the commandment will not know evil.'" He should also beautify the commandments - a beautiful lulav (palm frond), a beautiful talit (prayer shawl), a beautiful scroll of the Torah, tefillin and the like, in a manner that people will praise it and complement him about them. And Rambam, may his memory be blessed, explained this mishnah [to be] about character traits, to [follow] the middle path which is the choice path and is praiseworthy for the one that adopts it. As it establishes 'a pure heart' in a person and 'renews a proper spirit in his soul.' And "it is praiseworthy to him from [other] people," in that the creations learn to act well and properly from him. [For example] with the trait of generosity, 'A miser will not be called noble,' and also a spendthrift will see evil. And [so] who is the generous one? One who - even though he loves money and saves it very well - consults generously and orders his spending so that he will have enough 'to do the good and the straight' in the place that is fitting to give to. So [too] there is no trait under the [sun] that [is proper] except besides the middle path. And [these traits] are praiseworthy for the person adopting it, and praiseworthy to him from [other] people (but [not] if he does [too] little or [too] much).
<b>And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one, for you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments:</b> Even though the punishments for sins are explained to us - as some of them are with excision (<i> karet</i>) and some with death at the hands of Heaven, excision being that he and his seed are cut off whereas death at the hands of Heaven is only that he is cut off, and there are some sins that get the four death penalties meted out by the court, and there are negative commandments that bring forty lashes, and the one who transgresses the rabbinic laws gets rabbinic lashes for rebellion - but the reward of the [positive] commandments is not explained to us, not for the light ones and not for the weighty ones. And the sages, may their memory be blessed, demonstrated [this with] a metaphor (Pesikta Rabbati 23), "To what is this similar? To a king who gave an orchard for his servants in which to plant trees. And if he made known to them the giving of reward [of the different trees], they would have all toiled on those trees that have a large reward, and it would come out that the orchard would be missing the other [trees]. So [too], were the Holy One, blessed be He, to make known the giving of reward for the [different] commandments, [people] would do the weighty ones that have a large reward and leave over the light ones that have a smaller reward, and a person would be incomplete in the commandments." And for this reason, one should not be lenient about the commandments, and his soul should hold them [all] dear to do, since he does not know which are the light ones and which are the weighty ones. But our rabbi (R. Yehuda HaNassi, the author of this mishnah) excelled in his words and gave a stronger reason than this and said that "you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments" [as to] how much it is - as even the reward of a light commandment is highly elevated. And you should be careful not to lose such a great gain, like the matter that they said (Chullin 142a), "'If you chance upon the nest of a bird in front of you, etc.' (Deuteronomy 22:6) - and if for a commandment as light as a small coin the Torah says, 'in order that it will be good for you' in the world that is completely good 'and that you will have length of days' in the world that is completely long, all the more is it so for the weighty commandments of the Torah."
<b>Also, weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it:</b> As if your heart will whisper something to say, "How will I do this and lose my money with this and that"; you can also say to it, "Because there will be a great reward for it, two thousand times the loss." And with this, it will not prevent you from glory.
<b>And [weigh] the gain [that may be obtained through the committing] of a transgression against the loss [that may be sustained] by [committing] it:</b> 'Lest there be in your heart the base thought to say,' "There is great reward in doing this sin and I will gain very much with it and I will have great pleasure; and how can I not do it?" - guard yourself and consider that which you will lose from it in the end of days, as it is many times over that which you will gain now. And the future pain is much longer and bigger than the temporary pleasure. And when you put this into your heart, your hand will cease from doing [it]; as a person does not want a gain that has a greater loss [attached to] it. 
<b>Keep your eye on three things, and you will not come to sin: Know what is above you: An Eye that sees, and an Ear that hears, and all your deeds are written in a book:</b> He means to say that the Holy One, blessed be He, sees and knows all the actions of people and remembers everything as if it is written in front of Him, and He will repay evil for [ a person's] evil deeds. And it is a wonder why he counted them as three things, as the three of them are [really] one thing. As this is [all] just saying that God knows everything and will pay back in the future according to the deed. And [so] what is this calculation, as they are all one matter? Hence, it appears that the explanation is that this matter is a metaphor: that in the same way that when he is standing in front of kings and in front of ministers and sages and men of repute, he would be embarrassed to do things that are not done and from saying things that are not good; so [too] should he think at all times as if he is in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, in the same way as a man stands in front of his companion. And with this, he will guard his way - also his mouth and his tongue - from sinning, and 'from anguish to his soul.'  And that is why he said, "Know what is above you: An Eye that sees, and an Ear that hears," and counted them as two things - an Eye that sees corresponding to the deed and an Ear that hears corresponding to the speech. And God forbid - it is not a real eye nor a [real] ear. But rather, he means to say that there is no deed that is hidden from in front of Him nor one that is unknown to Him. And the third thing is "and all your deeds are written in a book" - meaning to say that there is no forgetting in front of His throne of glory. And behold, all things are ordered in front of Him, as if they were written in a book, to pay their doers according to their actions and according to the deeds of their hands in the end of days. And if a person puts into his heart the payback that will be given to him, he will prevent himself from doing [sins]. And about this, he said, "Keep your eye on these three things and you will not come to sin."

Mishna 2

<b>Rabban Gamliel the son of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi said: Excellent is the study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation (<i>derekh erets</i>, literally, the way of the world), etc.:</b> He means to say <i>derekh erets</i> [as in] work. As sometimes, the expression, "<i>derekh erets</i>" is like its simple meaning and sometimes it is said for work - it is all dependent on the [context].
<b>for the exertion [expended] in both of them causes sin (<i>aavon</i>) to be forgotten:</b> [This is] meaning to say that it removes the evil impulse, as it is stated (Psalms 51:7), "Indeed I was born with iniquity (<i>aavon</i>); with sin my mother conceived me." As by that which he exerts himself with Torah [study] and work, the evil impulse does not rule over him - since the whole time that he is not rich and fat, it is not pleasant for him to do sins. Hence one should be involved in Torah - which saps the strength of a man - and also in his work for the sake of his livelihood. And he should never be idle, lest he indulge 'and his heart becomes haughty, to forget the Lord,' as the matter that is stated (Deuteronomy 32:15), "And Yeshurun will grow fat and kick."
<b>And all [study of the] Torah in the absence of a worldly occupation comes to nothing in the end:</b> Like the matter that they said in our treatise (Avot 3 17), "If there is no flour, there is no Torah." The matter is like its simple understanding - when he neglects work, it brings him to poverty and it drags along several sins and its evil is great. As on account of it, he will 'love gifts and not live,' and flatter people even if they are evildoers, in order that they give to him. Also when the money from the gifts runs out, he will become a thief or a kidnapper (or gambler) and will bring 'home loot taken from the poor' so that he not die of hunger. And when a person reaches these traits, his spirit knows no restraint and he will not rest and not be still until he transgresses all of the commandments that are stated in the Torah, since 'one sin brings along [another] sin.' And about this, the sages said in Tractate Chullin 44b (see also Berakhot 8a), "Anyone who benefits from his toil, the verse states about him (Psalms 128:2), 'If you eat the toil of your hands you shall be happy and it will be good for you' - happy in this world, and good for you in the world (to come)." Therefore it is necessary for a sage to know a craft, as it is stated (Ecclesiastes 7:11), "Good is wisdom with an inheritance."
<b>And all who work for the community, let them work for the [sake of the] name of Heaven:</b> Not to be honored and not to derive benefit from them and not to lord over them, but rather to lead them in the straight path, and everything should be for the name of Heaven.
<b>for the merit of their ancestors sustains them, And their righteousness (<i>tsidkatam</i>) will endure forever:</b> As even though you are involved with them, their needs are accomplished by them; it is not you that caused them, but rather [it is] the merit of the ancestors of the community that "sustains them, And their righteousness will endure forever" - for a thousand generations.
<b>And as for you [who work for the community], [God says:] I credit you with a great reward, as if you [yourselves] had done it [on your own]:</b> Even though the merit of their ancestors sustained them and their needs were accomplished by the merit of their ancestors, and not by you - you the ones working - I credit you as if all their needs were accomplished by you and in your merit. So did the early scholars (<i>rishonim</i>) explain. But there is another explanation that can be given: "And all who work for the community, let them work for the [sake of the] name of Heaven" - and do not say, "Why is this distress to me, to work for the needs of community?" And [he will think that] even if he does charity, the giving of the reward will only be to [the community] - as it is their money. Since you should not think this thing - as you will benefit yourself for your sake doubly, since "that the merit of their ancestors sustains them," and you will be more successful in their deeds than you would be able to be successful in your [own] deeds. And I will credit you with the reward, as if you had done everything from your [money] and as if you gave that which was given through you from your [own] pocket. And behold, you are gaining with your toil from their deeds more than you would if you were toiling for yourself, since their deeds are more numerous than your deeds. And 'all that you do, the Lord will make successful in your hand,' since "the merit of their ancestors sustains them." Hence one who works for the community will benefit himself very much - but only if he directs his heart to Heaven.

Mishna 3

<b>Be careful about the authorities:</b> Which is to say to distance oneself from the government, as in the end they bring a person down from his assets.
<b>as they approach a man only when they need him:</b> (The matter of the king) [It appears that it needs to say, "And it is not a matter of governance,] but [rather] it is to investigate people; and there is no [end] (to his thoughts) [to their thoughts] - and who can get to (his) [their] ultimate [plans].
<b>They seem like good friends in good times, but they don't stay for him in time of his trouble:</b> [They are friendly] when they have a shortage of money, but when desperate they don't have mercy upon the poor person until they bring him down from his assets, and they forget the earlier [relations] since it is all past [and] gone. And such is the simple understanding of this mishnah. But if the matter is so, it speaks about the defect of kings. But forbid it, forbid it - that such should be the matter and that it should arise. As through them the whole world is sustained and they create law and justice in the world. And there is no man that can be as truthful as they, as they do not need to flatter creatures since they are not afraid; and [so] there is nothing that prevents them from walking the straight path. And hence it appears [that it can] be said that the kings - be it their friendship or be it their enmity - are not in their [own] hands. And [so] when the king needs a person and brings him close and shows him friendship at the time that he benefits from him, it is from God that the matter went out, and not form the king. And God arranged that this person be of benefit to the king. And when a man sins to God and he is guilty and He wants to press him, who can stand for him? And even if the king  wants to do him honor, it is only in his hand to surely take the vengeance of God and to 'afflict the one that the Lord would love to chastise.' And this is what it states (Proverbs 21:1), "Like channeled water is the heart of the king in the Lord’s hand." He wants to say, just like a person can direct a channel to any side that he wants, so [too] is the heart of the king in the hand of the Lord to direct it to do good 'to the person whose honor He desires' and 'to pay back His enemies in his face to destroy him.' And he stated, "the heart of the king" and he was not speaking about other people; but so is it that all hearts are 'in the hand of the Lord.' As even though, [a person] thinks thoughts and it appears to the eyes that he has the ability in his hand to act; in truth he does not have the power in his hand to do bad or to do good, but rather [to do] the word of the living God.

Mishna 4

<b>He was accustomed to say: Make His [God's] will like your will:</b> [Just] as when a person does his own will with  want and desire, so should he do the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. And [he] should not separate between the will of the blessed Holy One, blessed be He, and his [own] will, but rather make both of them [into] one thing. He means to say that he should not will anything that is not the will in front of God. And they said in the Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan (Midrash Mishlei 9), "And so did David say (I Chronicles 29:14), 'but all is from You, and it is from Your Hand that we have given to You.'" And he gave a good counsel to people to overcome their nature [and] do the desire and will of God, may He be blessed - also from their money and from the acquisitions: because God gave everything and [what they have] is [only] a deposit in their hands. And when [one] brings this up into his heart, at the very least he will do the will of the owners - which is God - with the deposit. And with this, he will not worry when he gives charity and he will do the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, willingly and with a good heart. 
<b>so that He will make your will like His will:</b> God, may He blessed, 'satiates the will of every living thing,' and 'gives bread to all flesh' and to every creature according to its lack - and this is His want and His will. And if you merit to [find favor] in front of Him, He will do your will also with the needs of your small world, and give you your sustenance - which is [actually] His will for all that come to the world.
<b>Nullify your will to His will:</b> of the Holy One, blessed be He.
<b>so that He will nullify the will of others to your will:</b>

<b>Hillel says: Do not separate yourself from the community:</b> At the time when the community is involved with Torah [study] and with the commandments, it is the crown of all the worlds and the glory of all of His domain. As 'with many people' that are gathered to fulfill His commandment, it 'is the King's glory'; and [so] it is not fitting to separate from them, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 33:5), "And there is a King in Yeshurun with the gathering." And this is with a community that goes in the good path and gathers to do a commandment. But it is not fitting to attach oneself to a community that leans to the bad path and the deeds of which are corrupted. And one who separates from them, behold, he is praiseworthy. And about this Yirmiyahu the prophet, peace be upon him, stated (Jeremiah 9:1), "Oh, to be in the desert, at an encampment for wayfarers! Oh, to leave my people, to go away from them— for they are all adulterers, a band of rogues."
<b>Do not believe in yourself until the day of your death:</b> This is learned out to be both about piety and about faith - that even though you have been fitted with a faithful and proper spirit, you should not be righteous in your (own) eyes. And you should not say, "How many days have I not done any iniquity - I have defeated my impulse and I am able [to overcome] it - it is beaten, already 'broken, and we have escaped' and it cannot divert [me] from the straight path." But it is an enemy and seeks to ambush you when it finds you sometimes involved in your work and not studying and not thinking about words of the living God - it will then dance in front of you and speak to your heart to divert you to 'roam in the earth and to walk' in a path 'that no good man has trodden or sat there.' And maybe it can [thus overcome you] and your soul will be taken in its hand. And so 'guard yourself and guard your soul much,' and do not distance its fear from you, and 'act with your wisdom' if you are a wise man to always place your eyes and your heart upon its ways, until it not be able to come close to you all the days of your life. And about this is it said, "Do not believe in yourself until the day of your death." Also concerning the matter of faith is this thing said, that you not study from the heretics - and not even true things - as their damage is dangerous, lest the sinners seduce you and you desire their words - as they pull in the heart. "And do not believe in yourself until the day of your death," to say, "I will listen to them." And if you might say, "I will accept the good and the bad I will not accept"; you should not rely upon your intellect, as Rabbi Meir [did] in his studying in front of Elisha the Other, the heretic. [This] is found in Tractate Chagigah 15b - they said about him metaphorically, "he found a pomegranate, he ate the inside, he threw out the peel. [However,] not all people are the same. As you find Yochanan the High Priest who served in the High Priesthood (seventy) [eighty] years, and in the end became a Sadducee (Berakhot 29a). As there is a very big punishment for even listening to them [speaking] words of Torah; and as we say (Avodah Zarah 16b) about that sage that was delivered to the heretics; and they said to him, "Maybe you heard heresy and it gave you pleasure, etc."
<b>Do not judge your fellow until you come to his place:</b> This is also from the topic that a person should not believe in himself and not overly rely on his intellect. And when he sees his fellow in a high position and not act straight, he should not say, "If I would fill his place, I would not do [one] evil thing from all the evil that he is doing." As you don't know [this] and you are no different than he [as far as] being a person - and perhaps the position would sway you as well. [Only] when you reach his place and his position and forego your [weaknesses, then] do you have the right to wonder about his weaknesses.
<b>Do not say something that cannot be heard, for in the end it will be heard:</b> As a person must guard and be careful from the possibility. Hence if you have a secret, do not tell it even to someone who is your soulmate. And don't say, "[It is] impossible that this thing be heard, as there is no stranger among us to transport these words." 'And in the end, everything is heard.' Even between you and yourself, do not make it heard to your ears, as the rabbis, may their memory blessed, metaphorically said (Berakhot 8b), "Do not talk among the walls, for the walls have ears." And about this, Shlomo - peace be upon him - said (Ecclesiastes 10:20), "for a bird of the air may carry the utterance, And a winged creature may report the word."
<b>Do not say, "When I will be available I will study [Torah]," lest you never become available:</b> Since 'you do not know what a [new] day will [bring]' and 'they will also call you tomorrow,' since they will speak new matters and you will have to follow their paths. As there is no lack of new matters [requiring your attention] every day. And it will come out that you will leave the world without Torah [knowledge]. But rather you should 'make your Torah fixed' and your work flexible.  

Mishna 5

<b>He was accustomed to say: A boor (<i>bur</i>) cannot fear sin. An ignorant person (literally, a man of the land - <i>am haarets</i>) cannot be pious:</b> The boor is empty - he does not have in him Torah or commandments or the way of the world in terms of good traits. And in the Targum (Onkelos Genesis 47:19), "do not place," is "do not <i>tabur</i>. And he did not need [to say], a boor cannot be pious, since he is not even one who fears sin - as from his emptiness, he does not [even] know to guard himself from sins. But an ignoramus is involved with the creatures through important traits and has a few straight dispositions: He knows how to protect himself and [so] he guards himself from transgressions. And he is [even] able to be righteous and to do and to fulfill what he is [told] that he is commanded. But only one who is great in Torah [knowledge] can reach the level of piety, since it is a trait that requires purity of heart and cleanness of soul. And [the ignoramus] does not have the wisdom in his hand to veer from the middle marker to the far end, to fulfill [going] beyond the [letter] of the law. And because of this he is called an <i>am haarets</i> - since he is with them in <i>derekh erets</i> (good manners), and because most of the world (land - <i>haarets</i>) is like him.
<b>A person prone to being ashamed cannot learn:</b> The trait of shame is good in every matter except for study, as the matter is stated (Psalms 119:46), "I will speak of Your testimonies, and not be ashamed in the presence of kings." As when David, peace be upon him, was running away from Shaul and he stood in front of kings of the nations of the world, he was not ashamed of speaking words of Torah and of the commandments - even if they mocked him and ridiculed his words. As shame is not good in study. And also the student should not say, "How can someone as foolish as I ask something of a great Torah sage, who is [so] sharp in wisdom, [whereas] I have neither intelligence nor understanding." If this will be his doctrine all of the day, from where will wisdom come to him? And this is what the sages [masters] of wisdom, may their memory be blessed, said in the book, Choice Pearls, "Ask the question of fools, and guard the guardings of the generous." This means to say, just like the generous do not squander their money and do not hoard it, but give it readily and willingly to the places that are fitting - as we have explained above; so [too] with wisdom, speak about it with fit people at fit times, but not with every person and [not] at a time when he knows that his words will not be heard. It comes out that you say that it is for them to ask every question and not to be ashamed, so that he will learn the things.
<b>An impatient person cannot teach:</b> It is not needed that a teacher be angry nor that he be short of [patience]; but rather [he should] be magnanimous and answer everything (that he has) that they ask. Even if they have difficulty in understanding his answer, he should review it for them until they come to the depth of the matter.
<b>Not all who engage in a lot of business become wise:</b> Since he is involved in his business all of the day and makes it fixed and his Torah flexible, he will never become wise. 
<b>In a place where there is no man, strive to be a man:</b> The early scholars (<i>rishonim</i>) explained, "In a place where there is no man" to help you in the commandments and to chastise you, "strive to be a man" and straighten yourself, so as to only 'do that which is good and straight in the eyes of the Lord.' Another explanation: "In a place where there is no man" - if you see a generation wherein the Torah is slacking, stand up and strive with it, as it is stated (Psalms 119:126), "It is a time to do for the Lord, they have abrogated your Torah." What is the reason that "it is a time to do for the Lord?" Because "they have abrogated your Torah" - as its beginning is learned from its end - as it is found at the end of Tractate Berakhot 63a. And we can also explain, "In a place where there is no man" greater than you in wisdom, "strive to be a man." And do not refrain from becoming wiser, even if you cannot find a sage greater than you in your city. Even if there is no one like you in that [whole] generation, see yourself as [if you were] in the generation of the sages of the Talmud and you are with them in one place. Even if you acquire their level, think as if you are standing with the prophets, up until Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him. And when will you reach their level and their wisdom? And in this [way], you will never slack from learning Torah and you will improve your traits each and every day - as you will add to your wisdom and you will be like a flowing spring.

Mishna 6

<b>He also saw a skull that was floating on top of the water:</b> Because you killed and caused the skull of the killed man to float, they killed you and made your skull float. But it was not like the law and it is as if they spilled innocent blood. And that is the [case], because it is not (like the law) [in your hand] to kill the murderer, but rather [it is for] the court, according to the [laws of the] Torah. And anyone [else] who kills him is obligated the death penalty, since his blood is not delivered into the hand of the killer to kill him. And because of this, <b>in the end, those that drowned you will be drowned</b> [by] others. They will do to them as they did to others. As this thing will be like this since they are all guilty, and [an act engendering] 'guilt is given over to the guilty.'

Mishna 7

<b>He was accustomed to say: The more flesh, etc.:</b> A person thinks that he adds life with pleasure and pampering - as he acts according to nature. 'But there is no control over the day of death' - it will 'not be a help or a benefit, but it will be for shame' and even for vermin. 
<b>The more possessions, the more worry:</b> Do not think that because of the honor of his wealth and the multitude of his assets, he will while away his days in bounty and his years in pleasantness. But [instead], he will worry about them the whole entire year. 'Ask him and he will tell you, your wealthy ones and they will say to you.' 
<b> The more man-servants, the more theft. The more maidservants, the more lewdness. The more wives, the more witchcraft:</b> And if the man-servants steal, he is struck for them - as it is in his hand to stop them. And even if he does not know [about it], the matter will be cast upon him - as they are his money and his gold (they belong to him). Also when the maidservants are lewd with others, the matter is upon him as if he himself was lewd - as an abomination was done in his house. Also in the proliferation of wives, he causes them to do witchcraft - to increase love [towards them]: the hated one will redouble [her efforts] until she sways his heart, 'and her rival was surely angered.' And they will hang the matter upon his neck, since it is a major sin - as it is stated (Exodus 22:17), "You shall not let a witch live."
<b>The more Torah, the more life:</b> This matter corresponds to that which he said, "The more flesh, the more vermin." As through enjoyment, he will shorten his days; but through toil in Torah [study], they will be lengthened. And it also corresponds to "The more possessions, the more worry," as the worry over possessions shortens his years. But the worry over Torah - even though it is great worry, to the one who understands, when he figures out the law to the point that he can 'say the thing in an apt fashion' - this worry cannot cause him evil. Even though the wise men of science have said that concern is sickness of the heart and worry is destruction of the heart, worry over Torah 'will  increase for him length of days and years of life and peace.' And about this Shlomo, peace be upon him, said (Proverbs 10:27), "The fear of the Lord adds life; the years of the wicked will be shortened."
<b>The more wisdom, the more sitting [and studying]:</b> He means to say, the wisdom of reasoning and argument, as through this, he increases sitting. As students will come to hear the new [ideas] and to sharpen themselves with him and to learn the matter of the novel rationale - as this is a wisdom in of itself. And he means to say that he is given reward corresponding to all of them, since he is the catalyst. And this matter corresponds to that which he said, "The more maidservants, the more lewdness." As there [are things] that others do and it is seen as if he did it [himself], for the bad or for the good.
<b>The more charity, the more peace:</b> Due to benefiting from his money, [people] love the one who gives charity and he increases peace in the world. And also when he gives advice to others to give charity, it is considered as if he [gave] it himself. And people love him for this and also for that. It corresponds to that which he said, "The more man-servants, the more theft." As [there], it is because of the actions of others - the theft of his servants - [that] people hate him.  But one who increases charity, which causes others to give, increases his love from the creatures.
<b>One who has acquired a good name has acquired for himself:</b> As the good name for himself, he will not leave to others. It is the opposite of the one who increases possessions, since with his death, he - the one who comes from them - will leave them over and go without desire.
<b>One who has acquired words of Torah has acquired for himself the life of the World to Come:</b>

Mishna 8

<b>Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai received [the tradition] from Hillel and Shammai. He used to say: If you have learned a lot of Torah, do not credit it favorably, etc.:</b> You are still at the beginning, and when will you reach the middle and the end? As the Torah's 'measurement is longer than the land and wider than the sea,' and human comprehension is not able to reach the far end [of it]. And how distant is a man from it; and [so] how can he credit it favorably for himself? And he has not accomplished even one 'Torah' from the thousand that he is to accomplish.
<b>because for this you were created:</b> The Holy One, blessed be He, only brought you into existence to do His will. And also for this reason is it not for you to credit it favorably for yourself if you have accomplished much Torah - "because for this you were created." There is a metaphor [about this]: If a debtor repays his debt, do we credit it favorably to him for that? And this measure is also [true] for the commandments - that if you have done many commandments, "do not credit if favorably for yourself, because for this you were created." 
<b>Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai had five students: Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananya, Rabbi Yosi the Priest, Rabbi Shimon ben Netanel, and Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh. He would recount their praises: Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos is a pit covered in plaster that does not lose a drop:</b> The explanation is that he did not forget anything ever from all that which he learned, like the pit after it has been plastered with plaster and does not lose a drop, as the water is not absorbed, even by the sides [of the pit].
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananya--happy is the one who gave birth to him!:</b> The undifferentiated expression, 'happy' is a category that includes all of the virtues through which a person is happy. And when it mentions the trait [with it], it is [referring only to] a particular [trait]. And we have found it stated about fear as in "Happy is the man who fears the Lord" (Psalms 112:1). And also about the designation of a fixed place for Torah [study], as it is written (Proverbs 8:34), "Happy is the man who listens to me, coming early to my gates each day, waiting outside my doors," and it states (Psalms 84:5), "Happy are those who dwell in Your house; they will still forever praise You." And about devotion, as it is stated (Psalms 65:5), "Happy is the man You choose and bring near to dwell in Your courts." And about faith (Psalms 84:6), "Happy is the man who has refuge in You." It is also stated about one who prevents himself from [involvement with] evildoers (Psalms 1:1), "Happy is the man who has not followed the counsel of the evildoers, or taken the path of sinners, or joined the company of the scorners." It is also stated about those that keep the Shabbat (Isaiah 56:2), "Happy is the man who does this." It is also stated about those that walk in the Torah of the Lord (Psalms 119:1), "Happy are those whose way is blameless, who follow the Torah of the Lord." It is also stated about those that keep the commandments (Psalms 119:2), "Happy are those who observe His decrees, who turn to Him wholeheartedly." It is also stated about one who benefits from his toil (Psalms 128:2), "You shall enjoy the fruit of your labors; you shall be happy and it shall be good for you." It is also stated about those that keep the law and do justice (Psalms 106:3), "Happy are those who act lawfully, who do justice at all times." It is also stated about trust [in God] (Proverbs 16:20), "he who trusts in the Lord is happy." It is also stated about wisdom (Proverbs 3:13), "Happy is the man who finds wisdom," and it is also written (Proverbs 14:21), "he who shows pity for the lowly is happy." And about this is it said, "happy is the one who gave birth to him" undifferentiated; meaning to say he is happy with all of the happy traits - great in his wisdom and refined by his traits and in all of his affairs.
<b>Rabbi Yosi the Priest is pious:</b> As in all of his deeds, he would do beyond the letter of the law. And about this is it said in many places in the Talmud (Bava Metzia 52b), "we have learned the trait of piety here."
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Netanel fears sin:</b> As he would make fences to distance himself from the sins.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh is an ever-strengthening fountain:</b> As he was very sharp and a logician and innovate ideas from his intellect.
<b>He [Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai] used to say: If all the sages of Israel were on one side of a balance scale, etc.:</b> He means to say concerning knowledge. As he was like a plastered pit that does not lose a drop, and there was none among the sages of Israel that knew as much as he - who would not forget a thing from all that he learned. 
<b>Abba Shaul said in his name that if all the sages of Israel, including Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos, were on one side of a balance scale, and Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh were on the other side, he [Rabbi Elazar] would outweigh them all:</b> Concerning sharpness and logic did he praise Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh over all of the sages of Israel. It comes out that you will say that these two teachers (tannaim) do not disagree, but rather [here] it is speaking about logic and sharpness.

Mishna 9

<b>He said to them:</b> Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai to his students.
<b>Go out and see what is a straight path that a person should cling to. Rabbi Eliezer says: A good eye:</b> One who is 'glad about his portion.' 
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: A good friend:</b> That a man cling to a good friend.
<b>Rabbi Yosi says: A good neighbor:</b> To seek good neighbors, since their friendship is constant; and when they are good, their benefit is great. So did the early scholars (<i>rishonim</i>), may their memory be blessed, explain. But it is not the straight path - as according to their words, a good eye and a good heart are things [about] himself and a good friend and a good neighbor are [about] others. Hence we need to explain this mishnah, each word as is fit:
<b>what is a straight path that a person should cling to:</b> From all of the good and straight paths that a person should cling to. He means to say to cling to one trait, to be complete with it. As it is better for a person to grab one trait in full - that it become easy for him to reach all of the important traits via it - than his being someone with [attempted mastery of] many traits and he is not complete in any one of them. And this is that which Rabbi Eliezer said, <b>A good eye:</b> He means to say the trait of generosity, which is a fine and praiseworthy trait. And once he is at the peak of generosity, he will certainly reach the other virtues - as this trait [comes] to him because of a broad heart and a good eye. And a person like this is fit for every good trait, and this is what is written (Proverbs 14:21)," he who shows pity (<i>mechonen</i>) for the lowly is happy." This means to say that the humble are the ones that find favor in his eyes and [so] he gives to them with a good eye. [This is like] the usage (Psalms 102:15), "and they will cherish (<i>mechonen</i>) its dust" - that the dust of the Land of Israel will find favor in their eyes. 
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: A good friend:</b> That he cling to this straight path and it become easy for him to do it; and to be a good friend to the man that his heart desires, and to accustom himself that a (another) spirit be pleased from him. And thus he will come to be [on friendly terms] with all of the creatures.
<b>Rabbi Yosi says: A good neighbor:</b> That he himself be a good neighbor to all of his neighbors. And once he becomes good and a loyal friend to five or eight people, the matter is close for him to love all that come to the world. And [so] he is happy and with all of the good traits.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: Seeing the consequences of one's actions:</b> That he places his eyes on everything, and see all of the things that will be generated before they  are generated. And when he sees something that has reward at its beginning but its end will bring a loss, he will distance himself from it. And with this, he will never sin - as he will 'weigh the gain [that may be obtained through the committing] of a transgression against the loss [that may be sustained] by [committing] it.' And hence a person should cling to this path to weigh at the beginning that which will be at the end, and to weigh all of his affairs with this [approach].
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: A good heart:</b> Rambam, may his memory be blessed, explained that this is the virtue of perfecting the traits - as the attributes of a person come from the heart. And when his heart is good, all of his traits will be straight and all of his attributes will be correct. And he will be 'glad in his heart,' befriend the good  and only desire a thing which has a positive goal and not a loss. So did Rabbi Meir Halevi (Ramah), may his memory be blessed, write. And though the matter is like this, it [only follows] according to their [approach]. But this explanation does not fit according to our approach. Hence it appears [correct] to explain that [with] "a good heart," he means to say the trait of willpower (literally, will). That is the tolerant one who is not short tempered, distances himself from the trait of anger and answers softly. Even (but) when someone does evil to him, he tolerates him and there is no bitterness in his mouth - as 'his palate is sweets and he is all delights.' 
<b>He said to them: I see the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh [as better than] all of yours, because your words are included in his:</b> As a man that has a trait like this dwell within him is also good to his friends and to his neighbors and to the whole world. He also has the trait of generosity; as he is generous to people with his body and heart, to wish what they desire and to do their will - all the more so will he be generous to them with his money. And every good trait will reside in a person like this - as the will of a healthy heart is a greater thing than the act. As behold, the commandments are the action of the limbs [and] are only labor, and easy to do. But that he should place his eyes and his heart there all the days to think of thoughts to do the labor of God from great devotion and love [of God] for his Name, may He be blessed - that is the [true effort] from this thing.
<b>He said to them: Go out and see what is an evil path that a person should distance himself from. Rabbi Eliezer says: A bad eye:</b> We need to explain his question and their answer, as it is a known thing that the opposite of the straight way is the way that a person should distance from himself. And the correct [reason that the question was asked] is because there are several good traits the opposite of which are not bad;  like the trait of piety which is a very great virtue - but if one is not pious, no bad will happen. About this, he said "a bad eye" - meaning to say, that a person not say stinginess is not bad since he doesn't extort or rob from his fellow. But [actually] its evil is great, as it is the basis for every bad trait. And from it, he will do every evil thing. As he should not say [about this], "If I do not reach the final culmination of the virtues, I [will] not be a pious man, but I will [still] be righteous in doing that which I was commanded about." And he does not know that it is 'a lack that cannot be counted.' Yet it will be lacking in his heart at the end of days - as the little that is lacking will be a big lack, as Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated in his wisdom (Ecclesiastes 10:1), "Dead flies turn the perfumer’s ointment fetid and putrid; so a little folly outweighs massive wisdom." He meant to say [that] just like a fly - which is a small thing - completely destroys a very important thing, the perfumer's ointment; so too is a little foolishness to the glory of a sage and an honored man. As the trait of miserliness causes a man to be empty (<i>beliaal</i>) of the good traits. [It is] like we find with Naval the Karmelite: Because he said (I Samuel 25:11), "Should I take my bread and my water, etc.," it stated about him (Samuel I 25:25), "Please, my lord, pay no attention to that empty man, Naval."
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: A bad friend. Rabbi Yosi says: A bad neighbor:</b> In he himself being bad to his friend or his neighbors. 
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: One who borrows but does not repay:</b> He could not have said the opposite of "the one who sees the consequences of one's actions" in general is the one from which everyone should distance himself. As everyone distances themselves from this [trait] on their own. But one is able to cling to it through an action; and [so] he took something about which a person should see the consequences [in action]: One who does not see it does not distance himself from the bad path, like the borrower who does not pay. Since at the time that he borrowed, he should have thought and seen if he would be able to pay up when the time of payment would come. And if he is not aware on his own if he will have the wherewithal in his hand [to pay], he should not borrow now - in view of the duress that he will have. [Rather], he should endure the current duress, even if he very much needs the loan.
<b>Borrowing from a person is like borrowing from the Omnipresent blessed be He:</b> As we find loaning with the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated (Proverbs 19:17), "He who has compassion for the poor makes a loan to the Lord; He will repay him his due." It wanted to say that it is as if this compassionate one towards the poor is lending to God, and [so] he has a great reward. And this is what it says here, "is like borrowing from the Omnipresent" - meaning to say that he not think that since I don't have with what to pay and I was already brought to court and they did not find anything for me to pawn and I left innocent, what is my transgression and what is my sin? And the matter to you is as if you borrowed from the Omnipresent, blessed be He; and if you are exempt from the laws of man, you are nonetheless not [exempt] from the laws of Heaven. And you will not be exempt on account of people [as] the case will be between you and God. Since when you have a case for a loan with people, you are not exempt - even if people have exempted you. What is the reason? As it is stated (Psalms 37:21), "The evildoer borrows and does not repay; the righteous has compassion and gives" - meaning to say, that since he borrowed and does not repay, he is an evildoer. And [this is so] even though he doesn't have [with what to pay], as it was up to him to investigate with what he would repay from the beginning. But the righteous one is compassionate and gives what he has to give, giving it [so that he can still] repay. Since he is nonetheless careful from the beginning with that with which he can repay. And even though we do not hold it as a credit for the man who repays his obligation; for the righteous one who has 'grace on his lips' in his way in the world, we hold it as a credit when he returns people's money and they become his friends on account of their money. 
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: A bad heart. He said to them: I see the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh [as better than] all of yours, for your words are included in his.</b>

Mishna 10

<b>They said:</b> The students of Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai.
<b>three things:</b> They said many, many things. But rather it wants to say that each one was accustomed to saying three things everyday - like the matter that they said (Berakhot 17a), "It is a pearl in the mouth of Rav" - about things that are always needed.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The honor of your friend should be as dear to you as your own:</b> We have learned the laws of the way of the world (<i>derekh erets</i>) here: He should seek the honor of his friend and desire that they honor him, as he desired his own honor. And this is the way of ethics. 
<b>and do not be easy to anger:</b> It is known that the trait of anger is very bad, however it is the nature of people to be pulled in by it. Hence he said that perforce sometimes be careful of anger, so that you not be easy to anger - since your will will desire anger: Weigh in the scales of your intellect if this thing is fit to get angry about. And if you find (that if) [any] argument to remove your anger, [use it and] negate it. But if it is a thing that is fit to be angry about regardless, then your anger will be with you (you can allow yourself to get angry). And this is what Shlomo - peace be upon him - stated (Ecclesiastes 7:9), "Don’t let your spirit be quickly angered, for anger rests in the laps of fools" - he meant to say, do not be quick to anger, but rather with deliberation and only for a great need. And do not do like the fool, who - because anger resides in his lap - hurries to get angry and does not know to subdue his spirit. And [he does this] even with something that he does not need anger for; even though he knows that he will spoil [the matter] as a result of his anger, he will nonetheless not restrain his spirit. [He is] like the snake which, according to some of the sages (Sanhedrin 78a), has venom in its teeth - and [so] when he bites, the venom goes out automatically and the snake does not need to discharge it. So [too] is anger in the lap of the fools - it is found there [and] goes out automatically. And this is what the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Eruvin 65b), "By three things is a person known: his cup, his wallet and his anger."
<b>and repent one day before your death:</b> One should repent today, lest he die tomorrow. And since he does not know the day of [his] death, it comes out that all of his days will be in repentance. And this is that which is stated (Ecclesiastes 9:8), "At all times, let your clothes be white." These three things are a pearl in the mouth of Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos, as they are things that are always needed by every man. 
<b>And warm yourself by (<i>keneged</i>) the fire of the sages:</b> The explanation of <i>keneged</i> [here] is close [to].
<b>but be cautious around their coals that you should not be burned:</b> It is a metaphor of the one that warms himself by the fire: If he stands far from it as is fit for him, it comes out that he benefits and is not burned. But if he approaches too closely, it comes out that he gets burned. So [is it with] the one who warms himself by the fire of the sages and benefits from their wisdom - he must stand in front of them with awe, fear and seriousness of mind. And he should not act lightheadedly in front of them. And he should not approach them more than they have brought him close, as this trait pushes him away and makes him liable for a big punishment. And it is not necessary to say [that this is the case] at the time when [the sages] stumble in a matter of sin.
<b>for their bite is the bite of a snake, and their sting is the sting of a scorpion:</b> And lest it come into your mind that you can seduce him in the [same] way that we whisper to (charm) the snake and he does not bite; the matter is not like that. Rather their bite is the bite of a snake, but their whisper is the whisper of a viper that does not listen to the voice of whisperers (charmers). 
<b>and all of their words are like burning coals:</b> (The editor said, "According to what appears, there is a word missing here, but the matter is understood") And to say, "I also have a living spirit and I will make arguments like him." But [you should be concerned that] the wisdom is not in your hand, lest you are mistaken in your argument. As their words are chosen and there is sharpness in their biting wisdom that is inside of them. And this thing is not from the three things that are counted that Rabbi Eliezer said, as he did not say it every day. And one time that he places into his heart to be careful about the honor of the sages is enough for him for a long time; as it is not something that needs reminding every day, like the first three.

Mishna 11

<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: The evil eye:</b> Its explanation is one who is not happy with his lot and places his eye on his fellow who is wealthier than he, [thinking] when will I be as wealthy as the great wealth of this man? And this causes evil to himself and to his fellow. [It is] like the wise men of science say about everything that is his neighbors: vapor comes up from that thought and burns the things that he put his eye towards with an evil eye. He also burns [himself] inside. Since he desires things, the thought of which he does not have the ability in his hand to materialize his, he destroys his body - as he shortens his spirit and removes it from the world. And this is the evil eye about which Rabbi Yehoshua spoke. And the proof of this explanation is that here he said, evil eye (<i>ra</i>) in the masculine - which is the one that put his eye [to something] for evil. And above (Avot 2:9), it said evil eye in the feminine (<i>raah</i>), the explanation of which is about the trait of stinginess. [And it is] not like the words of some of the commentators.  And <b>the evil inclination, and hatred of the creations</b> - like their simple meaning -<b>remove a person from the world</b>.

Mishna 12

<b>Rabbi Yosi says: The money of your friend should be as dear to you as your own:</b> To fulfill the command of its owner.
<b>Prepare yourself to study Torah:</b> Prepare yourself with good traits so that you can study the Torah and reach the level of piety, as it stated (Avot 2:5), "An ignorant person cannot be pious." And this is what Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated (Proverbs 24:7), "Wise things are too lofty for a fool; he does not open his mouth in the gate." He wanted to say that [for] the fool wisdom is 'far and very high - who can find it.' And in the place where they determine the law and speak with wisdom, he muzzles his mouth - as he does not know [what] to answer. "He who has thoughts to do harm is called by men a master of plots" (Proverbs 24:7) - that you not say, it is because the fool's intellect is not (with intentions) [directed], that he is not wise; since he does not have the reasoning to know wisdom. As behold, he has thoughts to do harm and his reasoning is great and sharp to do evil to the point that he is nicknamed and they call him, "the master of plots." Rather the wisdom of Torah does not rest upon him because of the evil of his heart - as he has the vessel (mind) with which to receive it. Also included in "Prepare yourself to study Torah" is to minimize pleasures, so that he learn much Torah - as we have learned (Avot 6:4), "This is the way [to toil in] Torah: eat bread with salt and drink a small amount of water and sleep on the ground and live a life [whose conditions will cause you] pain and in Torah you toil." As one who increases luxuries will not have wisdom dwell within him - as they said, his neck is fat, (his <i>koa</i>) [his calf] is wide.
<b>for it is not an inheritance for you:</b> And you will not acquire it if you do not exert yourself upon it. As it is not like an inheritance from the fathers, in which a child gets it without effort. And [even] if your fathers were sages or luminaries for several generations, don't think and say [that] the Torah will return to its [accustomed] guesthouse without any effort. And is 'the fruit of a righteous one a tree of life.' And the matter is not like this, but rather it is [only] 'to those that hold on to it and its supporters that are happy.' And the wisdom was only given to your fathers and you will not inherit them. And if you desire it, acquire it for yourself 'with the toil of your hands.' And if you do that, 'you will be happy and it will be good for you.'
<b>All of your actions should be for the sake of Heaven:</b> Even optional things like eating, drinking, sitting, getting up, walking, laying down, sexual relations, speech and all the needs of your body should all be for the service of your Creator or for something that leads to His service. How is it [with] eating and drinking? There is no need to say that he not eat forbidden things; [but] even if he ate and drank permissible things because he was hungry or thirsty - if he did this for the pleasure of his body, it is not praiseworthy unless he intended to fulfill the needs of his body and to eat in order to live to serve his Creator. Gluttonous eating will also do great evil; as the wise men of science have said that most illnesses are caused as the result of too much food and [that] a man should only eat to remove his hunger. And through this, he will guard his soul from distress and cause his body to be [in good] health. But he should not eat every time it is sweet to his palate, as the palate always desires to eat until his stomach is full - according to what a man can fill it. And through this, he will have every illness and ailment, and this is that which is stated (Proverbs 13:25), "The righteous man eats to satisfaction, but the belly of the wicked is lacking." As the stomach is only able to digest what it can hold; and when one eats and fills it until the palate no [longer] desires to eat, he makes the belly lack and destroys it - as the destruction of the belly is its lack. But the righteous person who eats to the satisfaction of his soul and only to remove his hunger, he sustains the body which the soul loves [in order] 'to do the good and the straight in the eyes of the Lord.' And the enlightened ones will understand. How is it [with] sitting, getting up and walking? There is no need to say that 'he not sit in a gathering of scorners and not stand in a place of sinners and not walk in the counsel of evildoers,' [but] even to sit in the council of the straight and to stand in the path of the righteous and to walk in the path of the innocent - if he did it for his own benefit and to fulfill the wants of his body and its desires, it is not praiseworthy; but [rather] only if he did [it] for the sake of Heaven. How is it [with] laying down? There is no need to say that at a time that he can be involved in Torah [study] and in the commandments and [instead] arouses himself to sleep to enjoy himself, that it is not fit to do so. But even at a time when he is weary and needs to sleep in order to rest from his weariness - if he does it for the benefit of his body, it is not praiseworthy; but [rather] only if it is to fulfill the needs of his body in order that he be able to serve his Creator and to give sleep to his eyes and rest to his body, for the needs of health and that his mind not break down in Torah [study] from the weariness. With sexual relations, there is no need to say that he not commit a sin. But even at the appointed time stated in the Torah, if he does [it] for the sake of the benefit to his body or to achieve his desire - behold, this is disgraceful. But even if he intended [it] so that he have sons that will serve him and fill his place, it is not praiseworthy; but rather only if it is that he have sons to serve the Omnipresent, may He be blessed, or that he intended to have sexual relations to fulfill the appointed time stated in the Torah - like who one pays off a debt to his creditor. How is it [with] speaking? There is no need to say [not] to recount evil speech and foulness of the mouth and similar to them. But even in recounting words of wisdom, his intention needs to be for the service of his Creator or for something that will bring him to His service. The principle of the matter is that a person is obligated to put his eyes and his heart to his ways, and to weigh all of his deeds in the scales of his mind. And when he sees that something brings him to the service of his Creator, may He be blessed, he should do it; and if not, he should separate from it. And so wrote Rambam, may his memory be blessed.

Mishna 13

<b>Rabbi Shimon says: Be careful in the reciting of Shema:</b> Be careful with the reciting of the Shema more than with prayer. [This is] because the time of [the morning] prayer is large and wide, as it is up to four hours [from daybreak]; but the time of reciting Shema [in the morning] is short and precise - with the sunrise, according to the <i>vatikin</i> (punctilious ones). And this is [the reason] for the expression, "be careful" - as it requires great care. 
<b>When you pray, do not make your prayer fixed, rather prayers for mercy and supplication before the Omnipresent, blessed be He:</b> That he say the prayer like a poor man, supplicating and asking for something that he needs - as 'a pauper will speak supplications.' And [he should] not be like a man who requests something but does not need it - as he will not supplicate with a full heart, nor with a broken spirit. And every man needs to request about himself, 'as there is no man in the world who will not sin.' And the prayer should also not be like a burden, and he should not do it like one who repays his debt - as it is stated (the editor said that according to the text of our mishnah, he [cites] the verse from Joel 2:13) (Jonah 4:2), "You are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in kindness, renouncing the bad" - as every man needs mercy. And if times [are fortuitous] for him because God, may He be blessed, is slow to anger and forgiving towards him; it is not because of his righteous deeds that God is merciful towards him. And [so,] he needs to supplicate Him lest God renounce his renouncing of the bad - 'lest [that] be caused by sin.' 'And not each and every hour does a miracle occur.' 
<b>And do not be wicked in your own eyes:</b> That he not be an evildoer in his own eyes, [such] that he not be able to repent. As it comes out that this one gives up on repentance - and if a sin comes to his hand, it is (as if) it is permitted to him, since it comes to his mind that it is light compared to the heavy ones that he has transgressed. And he should also not be righteous in his own eyes, as they said in Tractate Niddah 30b, "The embryo is made to swear in the womb of his mother: Even if the entire world says that you are righteous, be like an evildoer in your own eyes" - and not an actual evildoer, but rather he should be half guilty and half meritorious in his own eyes. [If he] did one [more] commandment, happy is he - as he has determined that he be on the side of merit; ]if he] did one more sin, woe to him - as he has determined himself to be on the side of guilt. And this is that which they said in Vayikra Rabbah (Kiddushin 40a), "A man should always see himself as if he is half meritorious and half guilty, as it is stated (Proverbs 14:16), 'A wise man is afraid and evades evil.'" He wanted to say that even though he has evaded evil, the wise man is afraid because he is evil in his own eyes. And it comes out that he runs after the commandments, so that they determine him to be on the side of merit. And he runs from the sins, so that they not determine him to be on the side of guilt.

Mishna 14

<b>Rabbi Elazar says: Be diligent in learning Torah, and know what to respond to one who denigrates the Torah (<i>apikoros</i>):</b> That one dedicate oneself to study Torah, so that he will know what to respond to the <i>apikoros</i>. As if he will not respond to him according to his arguments and his lies, the world will learn from them and 'drink evil waters' - in their seeing that he is defeated, and it will come out that the the name of Heaven will be profaned. And an <i>apikoros</i> here is one who denies the oral Torah, as well as those that issue rulings not in accordance with the law (halakha). And <i>apikoros</i> is [from the word] <i>hefker</i> (chaos; literally, ownerless). 
<b>Know before Whom you labor:</b> Before the One who examines the kidneys and the heart. And when you study Torah, exert yourself and put your concentration into it, and [that way] you will know to respond to the <i>apikoros</i> from it. And when you exert yourself in the Torah, delight in it. As we find that the Torah stated (Proverbs 8:22), “The Lord created me at the beginning of His course, as the first of His works of old" - and it is written after it (Proverbs 8:30), "I was a caretaker with it, a delight for me every day." You should behold that the Holy One, blessed be He, would delight in it - and you should do so [as well]. This is as it is stated (Proverbs 8:31), "Rejoicing in His inhabited world, and delighting with mankind." He meant to say that [just] like the Torah was a delight for the Holy One, blessed be He, before the formation of the world, so [too] should it be the rejoicing of the habitation and a delight for people after the world was created. 
<b>the Master of your work is trustworthy to pay you the wage for your activity:</b> That you not make your labor in Torah fraudulent, since God, may He be blessed, is the Master of your work and there is nothing hidden from in front of His eyes. And also, since how is it that you would not strain yourself on it, as behold you will have a great wage for your activity? And even thought they said (Avot 1:3), "Do not be as servants who are serving the master in order to receive a reward"; it is in order to overcome the impulse that sways one form doing the commandments and from walking in the straight path. [Hence] it is good to think that he will have a reward for them, so that he not give an opening to the impulse to attack. And also because they did not warn to know this in order to serve the Omnipresent, may He be blessed - because of the reason of reward. But rather in the same way as a person is obligated to investigate and know the unity of the Omnipresent and His understanding and His wonders that He has done in order to add to His love; so too is he obligated to [know that He] pays the wage of his activity, to  bring up to his heart the greatness of the kindnesses of the Omnipresent - [that] even though He is the Master of all the creations and the Maker of all and we are all His servants to serve Him and service Him like a slave that is His property without giving a wage, He  [nonetheless] gives that the reward and wage be with us. And on top of everything, we will increase our love from this and we will serve Him with fear and love. 

Mishna 15

<b>Rabbi Tarfon said, the day is short and the work is great:</b> The day is short - these are [a person's] days, which are short compared to the Torah, as it is greater. 'Its measure is longer than the earth and it is wider than the sea,' and none can reach down to its end. And this is what they said (Shemot Rabbah 47:7) - those forty days that our teacher Moshe, peace be upon him, stood at Mount Sinai, he did not sleep. There is a metaphor [relating to this, about] a king that said to his servant, "Measure gold coins from now until tomorrow, and everything that you measure will be yours." How can he sleep, and will he not lose very much at that time? So [too] did Moshe say, "If I sleep, how many pearls of words of Torah will I lose?" All the more so us, that we should not give 'sleep to our eyes nor slumber to our eyelids.'
<b>The workers are lazy and the reward is great:</b> These are people that are lazy in their study of Torah; as even the alacritous  sages show laziness. Since it is in the nature of a person to show laziness and no one escapes from it - some do more and some do less.
<b>and the Master of the house is pressing:</b> The One who controls His world that commanded about it. And you are not like a worker who works on consignment. If he does a little, he is given a small wage and if does much, he is given a large wage - according to the calculation that was agreed for him with the entire job. And [in this arrangement,] the masters are not exacting. But rather the Holy One, blessed be He, commands you the work of the Torah, and the work is not made dependent on you according to all that you are able to do. But [rather,] if you transgress His command, you will be punished with a big punishment - as you do not have a right to desist [from it] even one minute.

Mishna 16

<b>He used to say: It is not your responsibility to finish the work</b> That it not come to your mind, "I am not broadhearted and I cannot finish it, and [so] what advantage is there in toil and what will my exertion benefit." As "it is not your responsibility to finish it." Rather since your are toiling in the Torah, you have fulfilled the commandment of your Creator.
<b>but neither are you free to desist from it:</b> That you not say, "Since I am not obligated to finish the work, I will not pain myself, but rather I will study one hour each day." The matter is  not like this, as you are an acquired slave to [the work] to 'meditate over it day and night' 'and then you will make your paths successful and then you will be enlightened.'
<b>If you have learned much Torah, your reward will be much:</b> To say that there is an advantage to the one who  [decides] for himself [to learn[ much, as he becomes wiser than the one who learns little - even though both of them do not desist.
<b>and the Master of your work is trustworthy</b> That you should not fear like a worker, and that the master of the house not say to you, "Go, go and come back," since he doesn't have money in his hand. As you are working for One who will <b>pay you the wage for your activity</b> and pays with trustworthiness.
<b>And know, the giving of reward to the righteous is in the future to come</b> And if you think about this, your hand will be strengthened to [study] the Torah, 'the measure of which is longer than the earth and it is wider than the sea,' and none can reach down to its end (- and [to do] His commandments). From this you will put upon your heart the greatness of the kindnesses of the Holy One, blessed be He, and you will increase [your] love for Him.

Perek 3



Mishna 1

<b>Akavia ben Mahalalel says: Keep your eye on three things, and you will not come to sin: Know from where you came:</b> And when you are keeping your eye on where you came from, the thought will cause you to be of a lowly spirit and you will be saved from the trait of arrogance, as it is stated about it (Proverbs 16:5), "Every haughty person is an abomination to the Lord."
<b>And to where are you going? To a place of dust, worms, and maggots:</b> And if you think in your heart to where you are going, you will not desire any of the pleasures - as you are toiling for worms. You will also find vain all wealth and honor - 'as it is all vanity and bad spirit.' And about this matter King Shlomo created the Book of Kohelet (Ecclesiastes) and began (Ecclesiastes 1:2), "Vanity of vanities" - to show the vanity of all good and of all honor. And after he showed the vanity of everything, he stated (Ecclesiastes 12:13), "The sum of the matter, when all is heard; revere God and observe His commandments; as this is all of man." 
<b>And before Whom are you destined to give an account and a reckoning:</b> As the creations were only created to fear God. As how will a person sin if he thinks in front of Whom he is "destined to give an account and a reckoning" - and more than for the punishment and the challenge - as he will suffer great embarrassment. There is a metaphor [relating to this] about a king in front of which a man enters: If [the king] finds him cheating in his deeds or lying in his words, he will suffer great embarrassment. All the more so <b>before the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.</b> Also because the embarrassment of the soul is greater after it separates from the body than the embarrassment when it is still there. As it is the nature of the body to forget, and when a person does an ugly thing and is embarrassed from other people about it for a year or two, he will forget the thing and the embarrassment will leave on its own.  Even if it is not forgotten from his heart, the thing will be faded and some of the embarrassment will be removed. As the nature of the body's forgetting mixes with the nature of the soul. And even though it does not overcome it to completely forget the thing, nonetheless it overcomes it [enough] for the thing to fade; such that some forgetting removes most of the embarrassment. But when the soul is alone, there is no forgetting before it - as it is completely whole and pure and there is no physical nature within it. And when it is embarrassed before "the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He," it is for ever and ever that it will stand with the embarrassment like now when it is [actually] standing in front of Him. And like that time, it will stand embarrassed forever. And this is what the rabbis, may there memory be blessed, said (Bava Batra 75a), "Woe for this embarrassment, woe for this disgrace." Hence in all cases, the one that raises these things to his heart will not come to sin.

Mishna 2

<b>Rabbi Chanina, the Deputy High Priest, says: Pray for the welfare of the government, for were it not for the fear of it:</b> As it is harsh upon us.
<b>man would swallow his fellow alive:</b> This matter is wanting to say that a person should pray for the peace of the whole world and be in pain about the pain of others. And this is the way of the righteous ones, as David, peace be upon him, stated (Psalms 35:13), "As for me, when they were ill, my dress was sackcloth, I afflicted myself in fasting." As a person should not make his supplications and his requests for his needs alone, but rather to pray for all people, that they be at peace. As with the welfare of the government, there is peace in the world.
<b>Rabbi Chananya ben Teradyon says: Two who are sitting together and there are no words of Torah [spoken] between them, this is a session of scorners, as it is said (Psalms 1:1): “[Happy is the man who has] not . . . sat in the session of the scorners”:</b> Two things are called scorning (<i>leitsanut</i>). One is evil speech: one who speaks badly about his fellow, to disgrace him and to debase him among people - that he be considered scornful in their eyes. And this is from the great sins 'that a man commits and is guilty.' And this trait is only [found] among those that act wickedly. And about it Shlomo, peace be upon him, stated in his wisdom (Proverbs 21:24), "The proud, insolent man, scoffer is his name, acts in a frenzy of malfeasance."
 But two who are sitting together and there are words of Torah [spoken] between them, the Divine Presence rests with them, as it is said (Malachi 3:16): “Then those who feared the Lord spoke one with another, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for those who feared the Lord and for those who thought upon His Name.” I have no [Scriptural support for this] except [in a case of] two. From where [is there proof that] that even [when there is only] one [person studying Torah], the Holy One, blessed be He, determines a reward for him? As it is said (Lamentations 3:28): “He sits alone and is silent, since he takes [a reward] for it.”.
