Rabbeinu Yonah on Pirkei Avot



Perek 1



Mishna 1

<b>Moshe recieved the Torah from Sinai, etc.:</b> (I will begin the commentary on "Avot" of our great, pious and holy rabbi, Rabbi Yonah the son of Rabbi Avraham, may he be remembered for blessing.) Our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 30a) "One who wishes to be pious should fulfill the words of Avot (the Ethics of the Fathers), and [some] said about it, the words of Damages (Nezikin)". And since a person ascends the steps of piousness by doing one of these matters, they placed [Avot] in the Order of Damages. And even though they also said to fulfill the words of Blessings (Berakhot) which is in the order of Seeds (Zeraim); because it speaks of the blessings on seeds and fruits, they placed it in that order (Editor's note: See what Midrash Shmuel wrote about this in the name of Rabbi Yosef Nachmias, may his memory be blessed). Furthermore, since it is the teachings of the Sanhedrin, they placed it in the order of the laws (of Damages); and so [too], all the sages mentioned [here] until Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai are all from the Sanhedrin. 
<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> both the written Torah and the oral Torah. As the Torah was given with its explanation. As if it were not so, it would be impossible to understand [its contents]. As behold, it is written (Leviticus 19:13), "do not rob" - and all of the [laws of] damages are within this negative commandment, and they themselves are the Torah that was received by Moshe at Sinai, even though they were not written. And it is also written (Deuteronomy 17:8), "between a blood and a blood and between a judgement and a judgement and between an infection and an infection" - and many of the sightings of blood and many of the various judgments and so many of the infections are known to us by the transmission [of this information].  
<b>and transmitted it to Yehoshua:</b> as it is stated (Exodus 33:11), " but his attendant, Joshua son of Nun, a youth, would not stir out of the tent."
<b>and Yehoshua to the Elders:</b> as it is stated (Joshua 24:31), and all the days of the elders who had length of days after Joshua."
<b>and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly:</b> And that is Ezra and his group. And [some of] the prophets of the Second Temple were in that group, as they said in Yevamot 16a, "Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said, 'When Chaggai said these three things, he was sitting on this mortar.'"

Rabbi Tarfon said, the day is short and the work is great. The day is short- these are the his days that are short relative to the days of the Torah that are greater and longer than a land, white than the sea and there is no end. 
...The workers are lazy and the reward is great. These are people that are lazy in their study of Torah. Even the righteous, quick Rabbis are lazy. Since it is in the nature of a human to be lazy and noone is free from this. Some are more and some are less.
