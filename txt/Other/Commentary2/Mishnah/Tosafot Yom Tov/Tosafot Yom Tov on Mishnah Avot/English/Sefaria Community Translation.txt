Mishnah 7

<b>"Distance [yourself] from a bad neighbor:"</b> It stated an expression of distancing with his neighbor, since a person is close to him. And with an evildoer who is not his neighbor, it was not forced to say, 'distance,' since he is not close. [Rather,] it only warned him not to befriend him. And it said about the neighbor, "bad," and about the one who is not a neighbor, "evildoer" - even though both of them are evildoers - since his being neighbors with an evildoer is bad for [the latter's] neighbor, and his proximity is very harmful. But the evil of an evildoer who is not near to a person does not cause that person any bad - even though he is an evildoer to the Heavens - unless he befriends him. So did he write in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious teacher, Rabbi Yosef Ibn Shoshan. And in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Lirma, he wrote that he was precise [about] why it said, "distance" (<i>harchek</i>) - which is from the causative [form] - and it did not say, "distance oneself" (<i>hitrachek</i>) - which is from the reflexive form. And he said [that the reason is] that if a person comes to live next to the bad neighbor because he doesn't know him, one should distance [this newcomer] and warn him not to dwell [near] him. Up to here [are his words.] And in my eyes it appears that in both of the [cases here], the teacher adopted the language of scripture. With distancing, as it is stated (Proverbs 5:8), "Distance from upon her your path;" and you do not find <i>mitrachek</i> as a causative expression in all of scripture. And with befriending, as it is stated (II Chronicles 20:37), "With your making friends with Achaziyahu the Lord breached your acts." And that is as [the mishnah] ends, "and do not despair of punishment," which it  as it is in this verse [where the punishment comes at the end]. 
<b>"and do not despair of punishment:"</b> And it does not say that he should worry about punishment, since such a thing is a bad trait - the one who worries about punishment; but [rather], "do not despair of punishment." Which is what Haman did when he relied upon his great wealth, and in the blink of an eye, his success reversed itself upon him. And this is [the meaning] of the expression, 'do not despair' - Derekh Chaim.

Mishnah 10



Mishnah 11

<b>"Sages, be careful with your words:"</b> That which he warned the Sages, was not [with] the intention that other people are not warned about this; but rather if a doubt arises about the words of the Sages, the listeners will come to a general mistake, which is not the case with the words of a commoner, to whose words we are not attentive. Therefore, he warned the Sages more - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan.
<b>"a place of evil waters:"</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "That show sides of the Torah that are not like the law (<i>halakha</i>), and this is a term for 'evil waters.'" And the language is cut up (inverted), since evil waters is a term for sides of the Torah that are not like the law. And the language of Rambam: "Evil waters is a term for heresy."
<b>"and the students who follow after you will drink:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "As happened to Antigonos, the man of Socho, with  Tsadok and Beitos, etc... and they and their students became heretics." And similar to this did he write, in the last chapter of Mishnah Yadayim 4:6, "Groups of Jews gathered with them, etc." And this is not exactly the same as the words of the teacher, who is only teaching because of "the students that come after you." And I found in the commentary of Rashbam [on the] chapter [entitled], Yesh Nochalin (Baba Batra 115a), who wrote in the name of Avot DeRabbi Natan a story of Tsadok and Beitos who were teaching their students the words of Antigonos, "Do not be like servants, etc." and the students erred, etc. And so [too] did I see in Avot DeRabbi Natan, Chapter 5.

Mishnah 12



Mishnah 13

<b>"Spread (<i>Negad</i>) a name, lose his name:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "He who extends his name, etc." And so [too] does Rambam explain. And in Derekh Chaim, he is precise about the change in language, as from the beginning, he teaches, "a name," and afterwards, "his name." And he explains that this is what he is saying: <i>Negad shema</i> - meaning to say, the name of dominion, <i>nagid</i> (noble). And this indicates spreading, but it is not fitting; rather [it is better] to lose the name of one having dominion, since lordship buries, etc. And there are those that have the textual variant, "Spread a name, lose a name," with a [Hebrew letter,] alef. And in Midrash Shmuel, "'Spread a name' - one who spreads his name to make for himself a name, like the name of the great ones, loses his name, that he had before. And he ends up 'bald' (lacking a name) from this and from that." And in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan, he wrote that the correct version is both of [the times, 'name' is spelled] with [the Hebrew letters,] shin, mem, alef. And about that which he stated it in the language of translation (Aramaic), see the end of our tractate. 
<b>"and one who does not add, will cease:"</b> And Kessef Mishneh in Chapter 3 of the Laws of Torah Study (Mishneh Torah) explained, "That since he says, 'spread a name,' meaning to say, one who learns in order to enhance his name (fame), [will] 'lose his name;' and lest you say in your heart, 'I will no longer learn - as lest my learning will be for my name, and it will be lost, etc.' To this he said, 'and one who does not add, will cease' certainly - as one who learns and stops is more difficult than everything. And concerning the one who [even] before he learned, says that he will not learn - to this, he says, 'he is liable to die.' And this is not [as bad as] 'cease,' since here he is [only] obligated in the death penalty, but if he has a merit, it suspends it for him." To here are his words. And this is not like the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura, who explains that "one that does not learn" is worse than "one who does not add." 
<b>"and one uses the crown:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains, "The crown of Torah." And that which [the Mishanh] stated plain, 'crown,' and did not explain, 'of the Torah' is because all of the crowns besides it are nothing - Midrash Shmuel in the name of R. Y. Ibn Shoshan.

Mishnah 5

<b>"A boor cannot fear sin:"</b> See Mishnah 9 in the previous chapter and in the explanation of Rabbi Bartenura there. <b>"An ignorant person (<i>am haarets</i>):"</b> is explained in the words of Rabbi Bartenura in Chapter 5, Mishnah 10.
<b>"Not all who engage in a lot of business become wise (<i>mechakim</i> - literally, make wise):"</b> He said "all" because it is possible, and it has already been found that [some people who] engaged in much business became wise; as it happened with Rabbi Elazar ben Charsum or Ilfa. And many like them were cited by the commentators - Midrash Shmuel. And he also explained in the name of the pious one that it said, <i>mechakim</i>, which is a transitive verb, and goes back to what it said, "and an impatient person cannot teach;" and it [thus] says that all who engage in a lot of business do not make [others] wise - meaning to say that in free moments, he will teach others but he will not make them wise.
<b>"who engage in a lot of business:"</b> It specifically said, "who engage in a lot." As without buying and selling to sustain his body [financially], his Torah will also not exist, as we say later on, "If there is no flour, there is no Torah. And we also say above, "Excellent is the study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation."
<b>"strive (<i>hishtadel</i>):"</b> This [word refers to] a matter of training and thought about the thing. And the [Aramaic] translation of, "and a man struggled with him" (Genesis 32:25) is <i>veishtadel gavra imei</i> - Rambam.

Mishnah 8

<b>Received [the tradition] from Hillel and Shammai:</b> In Hillel's line it was not necessary to mention that they received it from him. And now it mentions [it] with Rabban Yochanan son of Zakkai as he was not from his grandchildren. And also because he had many students and disagreements grew among them and after them, it mentions [it to say] that even though they disagreed in certain laws, nonetheless, they received [and agreed] upon the main part of the Torah. And [it is] as I explained in the beginning of the first chapter. 

Mishnah 9



Mishnah 10

<b>"The honor of your friend should be as dear to you as your own:"</b> And he is not arguing with that which we learn later in Chapter 4, Mishnah 12, "Let the honor of your friend by like the fear of your teacher." Since over there, it is [dealing with] friends (colleagues) in Torah [study] - Derekh Chaim. And in Midrash Shmuel, it is written that there are some editions that have the textual variant here, "The honor of your student, etc." And [Midrash Shmuel] wrote that it is impossible to [say the correct] reading is "the honor of your friend should be like yours." As, if so, if he is someone who, by nature, is not exacting about his [own] honor, it would come out that he would also not be concerned with his friend's honor. And this is certainly not [correct]. And so did King David say (Psalms 15:2-3), "He who walks innocently, etc. The disgraced is disgusting in his eyes, but those that fear the Lord he honors." However with a student it would be well justified that they said, "the honor of your student should be be like your own" - as it is enough for the student to be like his teacher [and never more]. To here [are his words]. And it appears to me that if it is for this, there would be no argument. As the teacher only said that [his friend's] honor should be dear to him like his own, when his own honor is dear to him. And that is why he did not say, "The honor of your friend should be like yours in your eyes," [even though] it would be briefer [and therefore preferable]. But rather, he is speaking about one whose own honor is dear to him, and so he lengthened the expression by saying "dear to you." And know that this is the case, as behold in Mishnah 12, when Rabbi Yosi says, "The money of your friend should be as dear to you as your own;" would it enter your mind that if a person is squandering and wasting his [own] money, that he is also allowed to squander and waste the money of his friend? But rather Rabbi Yosi was not speaking concerning [such a] man. But rather, he was only speaking about one whose [own] money is also dear to him. Here too, concerning honor, [Rabbi Eliezer] only spoke about one whose [own] honor is also dear to him.
<b>"be cautious around their coals:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that you should not treat them with lightheartedness. And this is the language of Rambam: When you associate with sages and with people of lofty virtue, do not be playful with them and do not be arrogant towards them, but [rather] let your association show them that you will approach at the time that they will bring you close. And do not continue to come closer than that which they bring you close; so that you not lose their intention towards you and turn their love into hate, and the virtue form them that you hope for will not reach you. And he compared this to one who warms up with a fire; that if he sits far from it, he will enjoy its heat, (etc.) [but if he continues to approach [it], he will get burned]. 
<b>"for their is the bite of a fox, etc.:"</b> Which is to say that sometimes they hurt with a full action, and this is like a bite. And he said it is like the bite of a fox as its healing is difficult. And sometimes when they hurt it is without a full action, and that is only like a sting. And he said it it is like the sting of a scorpion. And sometimes they only hurt with speech and he said that this is like the hiss of a Seraph. So does it appear to me.
<b>"the hiss of a Seraph:"</b> [It means whistle with his mouth. 
In Old French, it is <i>sifflet</i>, in the same way as the geese do, one to another - Rashi.

Mishnah 11



Mishnah 12



Mishnah 13

<b>"Be careful in the reciting of Shema and with prayer:</b> Because they are the acceptance of the yolk of Heaven and service to Him, may He be blessed, therefore he warned about them the most. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote that Rabbenu Yonah had the textual variant, "in the reciting of the Shema more than with prayer. And he explained that the reason is that the time of [morning] prayers is long - up until four hours; and the time of reciting the Shema is short - according to the stringent, with the rising of the sun [only]. And that is the [reason] for the expression, "be careful," as this requires great carefulness. To here [are his words]. 


Perek 3



Mishnah 1



Mishnah 2

<b>"For the welfare of the government:"</b> That [means] the king and his ministers and his advisers who run his kingdom and administer law in the land. And that is why it did not say, "the king." So did the commentators explain. 
<b>"this is a session of scorners:"</b> As there no greater scorn than one to whom they say, "Count gold coins for an hour, and every thing that you count will be yours;" and he is idle [from doing this]. And he certainly scorns the gold coins and disgraces them. So is one who is idle from words of Torah - since he knows this great reward, he is nothing but a scorner. And so said the wise one, "Woe to the creatures from the insult of Torah" - behold, he called one is idle from Torah, an insulter. So did the explain it in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious one., may his memory be blessed. 

Mishnah 3



Mishnah 4

<b>"And one who turns his heart to idleness":</b> And a different text [reads] "and turns." And that is the textual variant of Rabbi Bartenura, as thus did he write, "One who stays awake, etc. and thinks, etc." And so is it written in Midrash Shmuel about the language of Rabbi Bartenura, that it [follows] the variant, "and turns." and it did not [follow] the version, "and the one that turns." And he also wrote in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed, that it is a mistake that fell into the books that have written "and one that turns": As it does not prevent [the question from being asked] whether the one who stays awake turns or not - [as] if he turns, he is the same as "the one who turns" and if not, why is he is liable [for his life]? And there is no [one] who can answer [this question]. To here [are his words]. And in the name of Rashbam, he wrote, "One who stays awake" - and even at home; "and one who wanders on a road" - and even during the day; and about both of them, "alone," [because] he endangers himself, as demons will attack him. To here [are his words]. And according to his words, one can maintain the textual variant, "and one who turns." And [this is] also true with the commentary of the teacher, Rabbi Menachem in Midrash Shmuel and we should not elaborate [here]. And in Derekh Chaim, he made this textual variant, the main one. And he explained, "One who stays awake at night" is hurt, as night was only created for sleep or for study, as we say in Eruvin 55a. "And one who turns his heart" [is speaking about] even during the day. And this is to say that he is driven to idleness and seeks wastefulness. But "The One who stays awake at night" is [liable to forfeit his life] even though he does not seek wastefulness, as long as he does not sleep or learn or involve himself with his craft - 'as any Torah that is not combined with a craft will in the the end be idle.' And according to the textual variant, "and turns," one would have to force [and explain that the reason] that it does not just say "and the one who turns his heart to idleness at night," is because, if so, it would have been understood that he is turning his heart to idleness in order to sleep. To here [are his words]. And see what I have written on Mishnah 8.

Mishnah 5

<b>"The yoke of Torah":</b> Constancy of reading [it] - Rambam.
<b>"they lift from him, etc.":</b> The language of Rambam: And they said, "'Engraved (<i>charut</i>) on the tablets' - freedom (<i>cheirut</i>) on the tablets." They meant to to say, freedom from the circumstances of time and matters of the [government is given] to the one that does what is written on the tablets. To here [are his words]. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote in the name of Rabbi Mattatyah HiYitzhari that Rambam had the textual variant [here], "As it states (Exodus 32:16), 'engraved (<i>charut</i>) on the tablets' - read, freedom (<i>cheirut</i>. To here [are his words]. And this [statement] is found in a bareita that the sages learned.
<b>"And one who casts from himself the yoke of Torah":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "One who says, "The yolk of Torah is too hard and I cannot endure it." And it is not the that the one that "is liable for his life" above (in the previous mishnah) regarding the "one who turns" is more severe than [the one] here "[upon whom] they place the yoke;" as it is certainly not. Rather, the one who "is liable for his life (literally, his soul)" that we said, is [only] if brigands or demons should encounter him, [then] he "is liable for his life" and his blood is required of him - as in (Genesis 9:5), "But however I will require the blood for your souls," as Rashi explains there. But it is possible that nothing bad will occur. Here, however, "they will place the yoke, etc." 'and he cannot escape' these yokes. [So does it] appear to me.

Mishnah 6



Mishnah 7

<b>"And thus with David it says, 'For all comes from You, etc.'":</b> About that event, when he gathered silver and gold for the Temple, did David say this verse - Rashi. And since it is possible to push this off, as maybe David is different; as he was donating to the Temple, about which God had specifically commanded ([subsequent to] Deuteronomy 25:19), "And it will be when the Lord, your God, allows you to rest, etc." And also (another explanation is) it is different [with] a group. Hence, he did not say, "As it is stated, 'For all comes from You, etc.;'" as it is not a complete proof - Derekh Chaim. 
<b>Rabbi Yaakov says:</b> That is the textual variant in the book, Midrash Shmuel. And he found it written that Rabbi Yaakov is the father of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, about which they said, "His teaching is straight and clean." And so does it appear to me is the [correct] variant. As behold, the words of Rabbi Shimon were already learned above, Mishnah 3. And if it is [placed here] because it is similar to that of Rabbi Meir, "One who forgets, etc.;" it should have taught it after the words of Rabbi Meir - and all the more so, as Rabbi Meir preceded Rabbi Shimon chronologically (as you can see at the end of the fourth chapter of the Ten Chapters which are in the Introduction to Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah) - and since they are taught adjacent to one another, he should have had the words of Rabbi Meir precede; even though it is [sometimes] found [otherwise] as I wrote in Mishnah Makkot 1:7 (s.v. Rabbi Shimon). And nonetheless, one could say that since the words of Rabbi Shimon are also similar to that which is before him, [in] Mishnah 4, "one who wanders on a road alone, etc.;" therefore they made it adjacent to both of them. (And it also appears to me that it is not an objection to start with, since Rabbi Dostai said it in the name or Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Meir [did] not [say it] himself; therefore, it is fine to have Rabbi Shimon precede.) 
<b>"He who is walking on the way":</b> which is a dangerous place. And some explain that it not only [on the way], but the same is true in a house. However since it is common [to find] trees and plowed fields on the way, it is [more] possible that he will interrupt.
<b>"'And how lovely is this newly plowed field'":</b> So that you not say, it is only [with] a tree that he [can] see from faraway and he says, "How lovely" which is certainly an interruption; but rather even a plowed field which is found alongside of him as he is walking, nonetheless, that [too] is [considered] an interruption - Derekh Chaim.  
<b>"Scripture considers him:"</b> In Derekh Chaim, he explained that [the teacher of the mishnah] supported this with the verse (Deuteronomy 4:9), "Only guard yourself," that is taught later on (in the next mishnah), and so [too] wrote Midrash Shmuel on the mishnah later on. But here he explained that he supported it with the verse (Job 30:4), "They reap salt-wort (<i>maluach</i>) from the leaves of the bush (<i>siach</i>)," which they expounded (Chagigah 12b) [to be] about those that interrupt words of Torah and involve themselves in conversation (<i>sicha</i>). And so is it translated [into Aramaic], "since they remove words of Torah from the tablet (<i>min luach</i>) of their heart, in order to take mundane words." And there is no need to mention the verse explicitly and he relies upon the one who understands, as it is not the way of a teacher of mishnah to elaborate. And it is also possible that he is expounding "bush" as a tree, as in (Genesis 2:5), "And every bush of the field," which the commentators explain [to mean] tree. And that is why he took [the expression], "How lovely is that tree." To here [are his words]. And in the commentary of Rashi it is written, "here we do not [follow the variant that] reads, 'Scripture considers him, etc.' as behold, there is no verse written [in this mishnah]. To here [are his words]. And so [too] did Rabbi Bartenura transcribe, "and it is considered, etc." Although in the mishnah later, he also transcribes the same expression, even though there it is derived from the verse, "guard, etc." And that which it is not taught here, "he is liable for his life, as it says, etc." as above in Mishnah 4, but rather we [only] learn, "considers, etc. as if, etc.," appears to me, because here it is only a chance interruption and he immediately goes back to his study; but above it is speaking about when "he turns his heart to idleness." And in Midrash Shmuel, he explains in the name of Rabbi M. Almoshnino that it is for this [reason] that it says here, "considers, etc." - to teach that Rabbi Chananya ben Chakhinai (above, Mishnah 4) is speaking about a person who has a proper time and place for meditation. To here [are his words]. And according to the second explanation of Rabbi Bartenura that here it is about one who is blessing, etc., it is not an objection to begin with. And just the opposite - that "it considers him" is a  novelty, [telling us] that the study of Torah is [greater] than all [other commandments]. 

Mishnah 8

Anyone who forgets:

Mishnah 9

<b>"Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, etc.":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that "he makes his fear of sin precede his wisdom in his thought, etc." And with this he answers [the possible objection] that he is not disagreeing with Hillel, who said in Mishnah 5 of the previous chapter, "A boor cannot fear sin;" as here it is talking about thought and not action. As a boor does not know what is a sin to fear from it; but in thought, one can think and fear of everything that might be a sin. And see further in Mishnah 17 (s.v. eem ein chochmah). And in Midrash Shmuel, [its author] was precise in comparing the beginning [of the mishnah] to the end. As by being precise about the beginning, it is implied that if [wisdom and fear of sin] come together, his wisdom will not endure; but by being precise about the end, it is implied that if they come together, it will endure. And he answered that behold, we say (Niddah 77b) that it is decreed about [a person] whether he will be wise or foolish; and now he only said,"Anyone whose fear of sin, etc.," to annul that decree: If his fear of sin precedes, even if [there] is a decree that he be foolish, his wisdom will be established in his hand, as we say (in tractate Megillah 6b), to remember one's study is [with] the help of heaven. But if his "wisdom precedes, etc.," since he did not study in order to do, behold, even though the decree is that he should be wise, he is rendered foolish; and his wisdom does not endure, because of the sin that he committed - not to learn Torah for its own sake, which [means] to observe and to do. (And you can [say that] the decree that he be wise is upheld in his other matters, but not in his Torah study - so did he write in the second section.) And if [his fear of sin and his wisdom] came together, he is left to his nature, according to the decree; that if it be that he be wise, [his wisdom] will endure, and if if be that he be foolish, it will note endure. To here [are his words]. And he wrote further that some have the textual variant, " Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom endures. And anyone whose fear of sin does not precede his wisdom, his wisdom does not endure." And in s.v. kol shechochmato, etc., he dismisses this variant.  
<b>"whose fear of sin (literally, of his sin)":</b> As "there is no righteous man in the world, who does good and does not sin." And that is why it says "whose fear of his sin" - that he fears from the sin that he is is prepared to transgress. And [so], there is no objection that it should have said, "Anyone whose fear of sin precedes, etc." - Derekh Chaim. And see the beginning of the chapter further, (in s.v.) hakovesh et yitzro.

<b>"And anyone whose wisdom, etc.":</b> Some change [this] and have a textual variant that reads, "Anyone whose deeds are not, etc.." And there is no need [to explain why this is incorrect,] according to the answer that we gave above, concerning "anyone whose fear of sin, etc.," as it also relevant here. And it is easy to understand it - Midrash Shmuel. 

Mishnah 10

<b>"Anyone from whom the spirit of creations find pleasure":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[About] anyone who is beloved below, it is certain that he is beloved above." And so did Rashi explain and in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbam, as it is stated (Proverbs 3:4), "And find grace and good intellect in the eyes, etc." and it says (Psalms 103:), "And the kindness of the Lord is for ever and ever on those that fear Him" - such that anyone who He places upon him His 'string of kindness, it is certain that he is one who fears Heaven.  
(<b>"find pleasure":</b> And with this language did we learn at the end of Tractate Sheviit: "the spirit of the sages find pleasure from him." And there I wrote the language of Rash and Rashi, who explained [that] it is like the matter of acknowledging a good (<i>hachzakat tovah</i>). And in the chapter [entitled] Hazahav (Bava Metzia 48a at the beginning), Rashi explained that there is satisfaction (<i>nachat ruach</i>) to the sages of Israel from the deeds of this one and their minds are at ease upon them. And "from him" [means] through him. To here [are his words]. And his language in the second chapter of Kiddushin 17b at the end - and he is [writing about] that from Sheviit, "the spirit of the sages does not, etc.," and he connects the two explanations together: "the mind of the spirit of the sages is not at ease upon them from his actions, that is to say, they do not acknowledge him a good, etc.," as he wrote at the end of Shevitt. And I wonder about that which Rashi explained in the first chapter [entitled] Hagozel, (Bava Kamma 94b) about accepting from penitents that the spirit of the sages does not take pleasure from them, "that there is no spirit of wisdom and piety within [such a one]." Indeed, I have seen in copies of the Mishna at the end of Sheviit that were edited there [to] " [there is] a spirit of wisdom.") 
<b>"And anyone the spirit of creations do not":</b> Both of [these statements] are needed. As if it had taught [just] the beginning, "Anyone the spirit, etc.," I would have said, "Behold, it cannot be inferred [that], 'Anyone [whom the spirit of the creatures] does not, etc;' as it is possible that the spirit of the creations do not find pleasure from him because he goes to the last extreme of piety." That it is why it comes to teach us [otherwise]. And if it had only taught the end, "Anyone whom the spirit [of the creations] does not, etc," I would have said, "Behold, it cannot be inferred that 'Anyone (who has) [from whom the spirit of creations find pleasure,] etc.,' as it is possible that the creatures find pleasure from him because he 'shows signs of purity about himself,' 'but he places his ambush within him.'" That it is why it comes to teach us [otherwise]. As it is an expert sign in both directions, whether positive or negative. And its reason is that it is written (Ezekiel 36:27), "And My spirit, I will place within you" - behold the spirit of the creatures is the spirit of the Omnipresent. And it is not taught, "the spirit of all the creations find pleasure, etc.," as we do not concern ourselves with a minority; as we find with Morderhai (Megillah 16b), as it says [that he was] (Esther 10:3), "accepted by most of his brother" and not by all of his brothers, etc. - Midrash Shmuel.
<b>"midday wine":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[It] draws the heart of  a person, etc." Since in the morning, he is lazy because of sleep and in the evening he is already tired [and] wants to rest. But at midday, a person is at his greatest strength to the point that he is completely happy - Derekh Chaim.

Mishnah 11



Mishnah 12

 <b>"To a youth (literally, a black one)":</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "To a young man whose hair is black," and as we learned in Mishnah Nedarim 8:3, "One who vows [to get no benefit] from black heads." And there we learn that women and children are not implied, as only men are called "black heads," but bald men and elderly men (with white hair} are included. And it is possible that it is different with vows, in which we go according to the language [common] among men; but here in the language of the sages in the Mishnah, the only thing that is intended is a young man, as the one who is not young, behold, he is included in "elder." And [here] we only have two extremes: either the elder and included in it is every man of stature; or "the black one," and included in it is every man that is not of stature.
<b>"and greet (<i>mekabel</i>, literally, receive) every person with joy":</b> Across from every person - whether an elder or a youth - stand with joy. "Receive" [here] is like to receive someone.

<b>He would say, "Everything is given as collateral, etc.":</b> Even though this is laso learned about the the whole world and continues form his first words, that he said, "Beloved is man, etc.," which he said about every person in the world, as I explained there with Heaven's help, and for this reason, he taught, "Everything is foreseen, etc" without "He would say," since there are not two [different] sayings here, but rather everything follows one from another, as I also wrote there, with Heaven's help, and behold, this mishnah is also also speaking about all that come to the world; nevertheless, "He would say" is taught about ti, since this mishnah is nothing but an additional , explanation of the mishnah, "Everything is foreseen, etc." As he is now only coming to say a parable about "with goodness is the world judged." "and everyone who wants to borrow, etc.": And this is [the meaning of] "freewill is given" above - that no person is forced to borrow against his will.  "The feet of a man, they are his guarantors - to the place that he is requested, there do they take him." (Sukkah 53a)

<b>"Like the strict ones" (<i>kebechamurot</i>):</b> In other versions, [this phrase] is not included. And in versions that include it, it is due to confusion with the beginning of Chapter 2, as there we learn, "be as careful with a light commandment as with a strict one." And if we do include it, it needs to be "as to a strict one" (<i>kelechamura</i>). And in a tractate Avot that came to my hands from the Land of Israel, the [phrase], "like the strict ones," is erased.

<b>"and a false (literally, vain) oath:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained in the second explanation, "that the teacher [of the mishnah] is calling a false oath, a vain oath, etc. 
<b>"an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit:"</b> An imbecile in that that he brings enmity upon himself. And wicked as he is not concerned whether [the litigant] will steal or make a false (vain) oath.  And on top of that arrogant in spirit, as it is arrogance of spirit that brought him to this - to give legal decisions and to judge [so as] to acquire [fame] like the [fame] of one of the great ones in the land - Midrash Shmuel.

Mishnah 15

<b>"the tranquility of the wicked:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[it] is not known to us, why the way of the wicked is successful and for what reason the righteous, etc." [It is in the format of] teaching, not only this [which is more obvious] but also this [which is less so]: It is not necessary [to mention] the tranquility of the wicked which is not understood to us, since we know that he is wicked and see that it is well for him; but even the afflictions of the righteous, as it is possible that he appears to be righteous but is not - and that is why it teaches, "or even" - Midrash Shmuel in the name of commentators. And according to the second explanation that Rabbi Bartenura wrote, the reason that it teaches, "or even" is that it is an obvious thing that we do not have tranquility in our hands, we the tired ones of the exile. And if you will ask, according to the second explanation that Rabbi Bartenura wrote, what is Rabbi Yanai teaching us and why did he say it; Midrash Shmuel wrote in the name of Rabbenu Ephriam and Ramah, may their memories be a blessing, [that] it is to say that we should not despair to think of ourselves as completely wicked and that our hope is lost, God forbid. And also that we are not righteous, that we have already perfected what is upon us to perfect in Torah [study] and [the performance of] the commandments. 
<b>"and be a tail to lions:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[meaning] to those greater than you, etc.," as they will benefit him. And so [too] did Rambam explain. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote in the name of Rabbi Menachem from the House of Meir (Meiri), that we have the textual variant, "as it is stated (Proverbs 13: 20), 'The one who walks with (<i>et</i>) the wise will be wizened and one who befriends (<i>roeh</i>) the fools will be broken (<i>yeroah</i>).'" And even though Rabbenu Yonah does not have this variant of the mishnah, he brings [this verse] as a proof, and explains that the word, "with (<i>et</i>)", is to teach that he is subordinate to [the wise]. And <i>roeh</i> (which can also mean to shepherd) the fools, [meaning] that he is made into the master over them, as the shepherd is the head.     
<b>"and do not be a head to foxes:"</b> One should be precise [here]: It is fine [with regards to] lions - he is the most honored and rules over all of the animals and his strength and courage are great - it is justified to make a metaphor to the great ones, men of fame, the ones of great strength that carry the yoke of Torah; but [with regards to] foxes - that certainly have lesser animals than them - why did he choose to make a metaphor with them? And in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Y. Lirma, [it is written], that one should not be negligent from learning wisdom until [the only way he can win an argument is] with tricks and machinations - for example that you will joke and make fun of your colleague and through this, his claims will be stopped; and similar to this. And you will be similar to foxes that defeat other animals and beasts with tricks [due to] the paucity of their strength. And it appears to me that it means to say that he should "not be like the heads of foxes," when he has not yet reached [the level] to make legal decisions, about whom it is stated (Proverbs 7:26), "she has felled many corpses." And they are compared to foxes, because when these want to sit in the seat of judgment and that the people will accept their decisions, they will [resort] to tricks and machinations to fool the people. And that is why it said, "a head to foxes," meaning to say even if you see that many are giving legal decisions [that are not on a level to do so] and you are the head and more important than they, do not be jealous of these sinners. And about them I interpret that which King Shlomo, peace be upon him, said (Song of Songs 7:15), "Take for us the foxes, the small foxes that destroy the vineyards" that it is the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts - and that is the gathering of sages, as we learned, "the vineyard in Yavneh," as it is written in Mishnah Eduyot 2:4. And then I found in Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Torah Study 5, that when he cited their statement, may their memory be a blessing, about "'she has felled many corpses' - this is a student who has not reached [the level] to make legal decisions, but makes such decisions;" he concluded, "About them said Shlomo in his wisdom, "Take for us the foxes, the small foxes that destroy the vineyards" - the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts." And it gave me pleasure that I had the same intention as such a great one as he.

<b>"One hour of repentance and good deeds in this world is better than all the time in the world to come:"</b> The beginning is not a [contradiction] to the end, as this world is for action and the world to come is for payment and enjoyment - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the teacher, Rabbenu Yonah. 
<b>"repentance and good deeds:"</b> See that which I wrote on Mishnah 11.
<b>"than all the time in the world to come:"</b> Rabbi Y. Abarbanel, may his memory be blessed, wrote that one can explain [it] as the world of souls and one can [also] explain [it] as the world of the revival [of the dead]. And [concerning] the world to come that we learned [about] in the beginning of the chapter [entitled] Chelek (Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1), Rabbi Bartenura explained [it as] the world of the revival [of the dead], see there. And so [too] did Derekh Chaim explain, see there in the previous mishnah.
<b>"pleasure (<i>korat ruach</i>, literally, cooling of spirit):"</b> It is an expression [related to the usage], his mind cooled off (<i>nitkarara daato</i>), as his mind cools off and becomes composed due to happiness - Rashi.

<b>Abraham, our father:</b> Since we merit and receive good in the merit of this one who withstood all of his tests, therefore the teacher [of this mishnah] called him "our father" here. [So does it] appear to me.
<b>and he withstood them all:</b> as he did not [question] His [actions].
<b>in order to show how great his love was, etc.: As with this, we certainly know how great his love was, etc. And it is like Rashi wrote in his Commentary on the Torah, (Genesis 22:12), "Now I will know what to answer the Satan and nations that wonder what My love is towards you. I have, etc."</b>

Mishnah 5

<b>Ten miracles were performed for our forefathers in the Temple:</b> And it lists them as they are not hinted to in scripture at all. 
<b>No woman had a miscarriage from the scent of the meat:</b> from desire for the holy meat. And also (another explanation is) from the smell of the limbs [of the sacrifices] on the arrangement [of the wood]; as if she smelled and wanted to taste from them, we do not listen to her to feed her holy meat - Rashi.
<b>and no holy flesh ever went putrid:</b> When he did not have the time available at night to burn all of the limbs that accumulated on the eve, they would bring them up to the top of the altar and they would sit there for two or three days until they would be available to burn them; as staying overnight would not disqualify them [when they were] on top of the altar [as it would if they were not there]. And a miracle would be performed on them and they would not go putrid the whole time of their delay - Rashi. And about that which it taught, "ever," it is written in Midrash Shmuel that it is possible that it is coming to include [the presence] of this miracle even not in the Temple; for example, on private altars; and also (another explanation is also in the Taberanalce when it was) in Shilo, Nov and Givaon. To here [are his words]. And one should add [to this] the Tabernacle [when it was] in the desert.
<b>and a fly was not seen in the room of slaughtering:</b> in the courtyard in the place that there were marble tables that they would wash the innards upon. And no fly would go down there because of [its] foulness - Rashi.
<b>and a High Priest did not have an accidental emission on Yom Kippur:</b> There is someone who objects: and why should he have an accidental seminal emission, since they were making him vigilant for all of seven days and he was in [a state of] purity that whole day and all of that night the elders of the people would not stop from making him vigilant. And the answer is that the good impulse and the evil impulse fight with each other like two enemies. And when one of them is close to being defeated, he strengthens himself on his watch as he sees that [his end is near]. And [so too] many people at the time of their passing away strengthen themselves and say good things as if they were healthy. And for this [reason] the priest was very close to being someone with an accidental seminal emission. So is it written in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed. And see what I wrote at the beginning of Demai, s.v. vehachomets she'be'Yehuda, etc, (Tosafot Yom Tov on Mishnah Demai 1:1:6) to answer that which they would prepare another priest, as it is learned at the beginning of Mishnah Yoma 1:1 - and Rabbi Bartenura explained there [that it is] because of [the possibility of] an accidental seminal emission. 
<b>and rain did not extinguish, etc.; and [the wind] did not overpower, etc.:</b> This is the textual variant that Rabbi Bartenura and Rambam [followed]. But Rashi wrote that we do not read [these two cases] in our mishnah; as in Yoma 21a, our mishnah is brought and these [two cases] are not taught, and [the gemara] brings a bareita that teaches [them instead]. And these - the omer and the two breads and the showbreads - were counted to be three, and [so] there were also ten. To here [are his words]. And so is it there on page 21 that there is a challenge in the end (it should say, "on the end") of our mishnah, since we learn two [cases] in Jerusalem, "it started in the Temple and it ended in Jerusalem?" And it answers that "there are two others in the temple, as we learned [in a bereita], 'never did the rain, etc.'" <b>the pillar of smoke:</b> that rose from the sacrifices. But during the time of the offering, the air was still - Rambam.
<b>and there was not found a disqualification in the omer:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "as the omer was cut at night and they would not cut a lot;" but rather only according to the amount of an <i>issaron</i> that is sifted thirteen [times] - Rashi on Yoma 21a. 
<b>and a snake or scorpion never hurt a person:</b> We do not learn, "[never] bit;" as even if it sometimes occurred that it would bite, it would not hurt. And that which we learned, "in Jerusalem," was explained in Derkh Chaim that if it were [only] in the Temple, it would not be so much of a novelty, as there were no hurtful things like these there. And see what I wrote above in the name of the gemara in Yoma. And that which we learned, "never," was explained in Midrash Shmuel that it is possible that it is coming to include [that] even not at the time when the Temple is in existence was there this miracle; as the holiness of the land alone is worthy of saving from the damage of the snake and the scorpion.
<b>"that I should lodge":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "there are books that have written in them, '"when I lodge."' And it is said about the holiday pilgrims, etc."; as they were not always living there. And that is the [meaning of the] expression, "'when I lodge'" - when it will be that I will lodge; as he was not always there.

Mishnah 6

<b>Ten things were created on the eve of the [first] Shabbat at twilight. And these are they: The mouth of the earth, etc.:</b> Rambam wrote and this is his language: "They would not have believed in the change of the [Divine] will at each and every instant. [Rather,] at the beginning of the making of things, He put into the nature [of things] that they would do what they would [eventually] do; be the thing something that happens [frequently] and that is a natural thing, or be it a change that happens infrequently and that is a miracle - it is all equal. Therefore they said that on the sixth day, He placed into the nature of the earth that it would sink Korach and his congregation and that well should produce water and that the donkey would talk and so [too] with the rest.



<b>the writing:</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "that they could be read from all four sides." And what is likely to me is that this was a miracle and that they were the work of God. And many hesitated in explaining this from among the commentators of Talmud Yerushalmi Shekalim 6 - see in Ein Yaakov and Yafeh Mareh. And after the last one do I go - the writer of the Ten Essays, who wrote in his Essay [entitled] Chakor Din, Part II, Chapter 20 about this statement in the Yerushalmi, that it was [so designed because it was] the work of God, which cannot be analysed with our intellects; not like the work of an ordinary one that [others] besides us would describe in front of us in the study hall and 'a youth could write them down.' To here [are his words].
<b>the tablets:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote they "were [made] of sapphire... and they were quarried from the ball of the sun;" which is to say that therefore were they soft and not like our sapphire which is hard and not soft. But it was sapphire-like to behold and like the actual sky in purity. And in the commentary of Rashi [it is written] that the tablets [here] are the first tablets, as regarding the second, Moshe chiseled them himself.  

Mishnah 7

<b>an unformed person (<i>golem</i>):</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "This is an expression as per [its usage in the phrase,] 'unformed vessels (<i>golmei kelim</i>) [the work on which has not yet been finished']" (Mishnah Kelim12:6); which are lacking their completion and finish. Like a knife or a sword when a smith makes their form and their shape comes to them before he sands them and sharpens them and he polishes them and he removes from them what is his custom to remove and he completes their finish. And so [too, the mishnah] calls a <i>golem</i> a man who has intellectual virtues and virtuous character traits, yet they are not completer and they do not proceed in a fitting order. [Rather,] they are mixed up and confused and lackings are mixed in with them. And this is not an ignorant person (<i>am haarets</i>) who has [knowledge] of the ways of the world (as these are only virtuous character traits), and all the more so is it not the boor of Mishnah 5 of Chapter 2 - Rambam. And see Mishnah 10 in the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura (s.v. sheli).
<b>does not speak in front of some one who is greater than him in wisdom:</b> As so have we found with Elazar and Itamar, who did not want to speak in front of their father, when Moshe became angry with them; and [instead] Aharon responded.
<b>and he does not interrupt the words of his fellow:</b> that he not mix him up. As it is written (Numbers 12:6), "'listen to my words,'" [meaning] listen to me until I [have spoken]. All the more so with simple people [is there a concern that it will mix them up].
<b>and is not impulsive in answering:</b> so that his answer be as is proper. And so was it with Elihu, he said (Job 36:2), "Wait for me a little and I will tell you."
<b>and he asks to the point and answers as is proper:</b> It is counted as one thing here, and this is its explanation: The student asks to the point, which is to say about the topic with which they are involved, and then the teacher will answer him as is proper. But if the student asks not to the point, he brings the teacher to answer as is not proper. [This is] in the way of what Rabbi Chiya said to Rav (Shabbat 3b), "When Rabbi is in this tractate, do not ask him about another tractate." And so [too] do you find with the people that were impure from [contact with a dead] soul, who saw that Moshe was involved with the laws of Pesach and asked him about that same topic.
<b>and he speaks to the first [point] first:</b> And so did we find with the Holy One, blessed be He; since Moshe said to Him (Numbers 3:11), "'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh'" - that is the first - "'and that I should bring out the Children of Israel'" - behold, the second. And the Holy One, blessed be He, answered about the first (Numbers 3:12), "'Since I will be with you'"; and about the second, "'in your bringing the people out from Egypt, you will serve God.'"

Mishnah 11

<b>[A person who is] hard to anger, but easy to appease -- [that's a] pious person:</b> But one who does not get angry at all is not found in any disposition. As who is greater for us in humility than Moshe, our teacher, - peace be upon him - and about him it is said (Numbers 31:14), "And Moshe got angry at the officers of the troop" - Midrash Shmuel. And bigger than this is (Numbers 20:10), "'Listen now, you rebels'" - except that there it did not specify that he got angry in the verse. 
<b>Easy to anger, etc., an evildoer:</b> As the master said (Berakhot 29b), "Don't be angry, and don't sin" - Rashi. And Derekh Chaim explains that it is like what we say in the third chapter of Nedarim 22b, "Rav Nachman says, 'Any person who gets angry, it is known that his sins are greater [than his merits], as is states (Proverbs 29:22), "(A man of anger man stirs up strife;) and a wrathful man much transgression."'"

Mishnah 12

<b>That is a bad portion:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "It would not be relevant to learn here, "pious" or "evil," as this is not something that is dependent upon the choice [of a person], etc. And even though it is possible with the help of Heaven to raise his study, if his fear of sin precedes his wisdom as it is written in Chapter 3, Mishnah 9; it is not fitting for someone who has not reached inclusion of this trait to be called an evildoer, as the disadvantage in his creation led him to this.

Mishnah 13

Mishnah 14

<b>[One who] goes but does not do:</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "He goes to the House of Study to listen but he does not review and study and does not understand." And one can explain that this is what he said: And also he [goes] to study and does not understand. And one can [also] explain that this is what he said: And he does not review and he does not study and he does not understand. And so does it appear from his language in the end that it is all one one matter, and because he does not study, hence he does not understand. And in Midrash Shmuel, he quotes [it as], "as he does not study and he does not understand."     
<b>[One who] goes and does is a pious person:</b> As he lowers himself and acts as if he needs the ones sitting in the House of Study - Midrash Shmuel. And in the name of Ramah, he explained that anyone who leans from the [mean] towards the good side more than towards the bad side is called a pious person. [This is] not because he is pious only in that trait, but rather because this disposition is the disposition of piety; as anyone who acts with this disposition is ready for the virtues of piety. To here [are his words]. And so [too] are the words of Rambam.

Mishnah 17

<b>The argument of Hillel and Shammai:</b> Because their students did not serve [in their studies] to their fullest and from them onward, disagreement grew in Israel; therefore it took them for an example. And because of this, there is also no objection from the beginning [of the mishnah] against the end.
<b>The argument of Korach and all of his congregation:</b> It did not mention the second side of the argument - which is Moshe and Aaron - as it mentioned the two sides in the first [argument]; as here they are not equal. As Moshe and Aaron's intentions were for the sake of Heaven, and there was no aspect in them that was not for the sake of Heaven - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Y. Lirma.

Mishnah 18



Mishnah 19

<b>and a broad appetite:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "As if he did not have great desire, he would not have counseled, etc." As the commandments of people are only according to their opinions, since the good will not command to [do] the evil, but [rather] to guard from it. And the verse states (Numbers 31:16), "They were the ones that were against the Children of Israel according to the counsel of Bilaam" - Rambam.
<b>"eat in this world:"</b> This is in the way [of] "When you eat [from] the work of your hands, you will be happy" (Psalms 128:2) - in this world; as Rashi explained at the beginning of Chapter 4. As if you don't say like that, behold how many students of our father Avraham, peace be upon him, are hungry and thirsty in this world. But rather, since they suffice and do not depend upon the creatures, they are called eaters [in] this world. And one could also say [another explanation is] that it is saying [here only according to] the measure of justice, but 'the Lord is the God of knowledge and by Him are actions measured' to have them inherit more [than this] in the world to come. 
<b>"There is what for those that love Me to inherit":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "In the world to come." And see at the end of Tractate Oktzin.
<b>inherit <i>Gehinnom</i> (Purgatory):</b> in this world, as we say (Yoma 72b), "do not inherit two [doses of] <i>Gehinnom</i> - Midrash Shmuel.
<b>people of blood:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Bilaam, as he brought down with his counsel, etc." And he is also a "man of deceit," in his doing machinations [to accomplish] evil - Rambam
