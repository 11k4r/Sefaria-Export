Tosafot Yom Tov on Mishnah Avot



Avot, IntroductionThis is the language of Rambam (Introduction to the Commentary to the Mishnah): When [Rebbi, the Mishnah's redactor,] finished what was necessary for the judge, he began with Avot, and he did this for two matters. The first is in order to make known that the agreed tradition and transmission is true and correct and [that] a small [group of] people received it. Hence it is fitting to honor a sage (one who is more wise then they) and to place him in an honored station, since jurisdiction arrived to him. As he is in his generation like these were in their generations. And so did they say (Rosh Hashanah 24), "If we were to investigate into the court of Rabban Gamliel, etc." And they said, "Shimshon is in his generation like Shmuel was in his generation." And there is a great deal of ethical teaching for people in this matter, that they should not say, "Why should we accept x judgment or the ordinance of Judge y." And the matter is not like this, as judgment is not from Judge y, but rather from the Holy One, blessed be He, Who commanded us about it, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 1), "as the judgment is to God." But it is all one law and they received it one man from another over the passing generations. And the second matter that he wants to remember in this tractate is the ethical teachings of each sage from among the sages, peace be upon them, in order that we learn the good character traits from them. And nobody needs this thing like the judges. As when ignoramuses are not men of ethics, the damage is not to the masses but only to the [person in question]. But when a judge is not a man of ethics and modest, he damages himself and and he damages [other] people. Hence the beginning of his words in Tractate Avot are ethical teachings for judges, as he stated, "Be deliberate in judgment." And the judge needs to be curbed by all of the matters that that are found in tractate Avot: for example, he should be deliberate in judgment and not hasten the decision, as it is possible that there be a hidden matter in that case, as they stated - peace be upon them - 'a deceptive case;' and likewise, he should not lengthen the case when he knows that there is no hidden matter in it, as this is called, 'torturous judgment;' and he must make efforts in the examination of the witnesses and to be careful at the time of the examination that the witnesses not learn from his words something that will help them in their efforts; and one should not teach a claim to a litigant and this is called, 'judges' advisers;' and he should not profane his soul by association with ignoramuses, lest it be a disgrace; and he should not withdraw from people to the point that they will not be able to see him anytime that they need him, lest a poor person will be hurt; and he should not seek rest and pleasures, lest truth will be lost; and desire should not pull him away. And [Rambam] wrote at great length about the ethics of judges and [the following are] the end of his words: And since it is seen that the judge requires all of these ethical teachings in order to be curbed by them, how pleasant and correct was the placement of the tractate Avot after the tractate Sanhedrin (that deals with judges and court procedures) and that which accompanies it; as it includes all of these ethical teachings and also - in addition to them - matters that bring to separation from the world and honoring the world and its masters and the way of straightness and fear. To here [are his words.] And [Rebbi] gave this tractate the name Avot (Fathers) because, in truth, the sages are the fathers, as in the matter when Elisha said (II Kings 2:12), "my father, my father" about Eliyahu, may his memory be blessed. And so [too] are the students called children, as it is stated (Isaiah 7:3), "and Shear Yashuv, your son."  





Perek 1



Mishnah 1

<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[Moshe received it] from the One who was revealed at Sinai." And there, when He was revealed at Sinai, [Moshe] received it with its general principles, its particulars and its inferences and there was no law that was to be innovated [later]. And it is as it is found in Torat Cohanim which is cited by Rashi on Leviticus 25:1at the beginning of Parshat Behar. And to teach this, [the mishna] states "from Sinai." And 'it is not an empty thing,' since, behold, it is a sign of the religion: it is one for its nation, the congregation of Israel that received it. It is complete to its Creator - the students, they are the children of God; what an experienced student is to innovate in the future, all of it was received by Moshe. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 9:10), "and upon them, as all of the words," and they expounded in the second chapter of Megillah 19b, "[this] teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed to Moshe the inferences of the Torah and the inferences of the scribes (<i>dikdukei sofrim</i>)." And even though the inferences of the scribes were only by way of proofs - as I explained in the Introduction - it states, 'received,' since it is speaking about the majority [of what was revealed to him]. [This is] as was explained by Ramban in the Introduction to the commentary on the Torah about the fifty gates of understanding that were created in the world - that it states, 'created' about the majority. So does it appear to me. 
<b>and he passed it on to Yehoshua:</b> As everything that he received, he passed on to Yehoshua. But concerning Moshe, it cannot state that it was passed on to him, since [it was] not the whole Torah [which] was passed on to him. As, behold, the fiftieth gate [of wisdom] was not passed on to him, as they, of blessed memory, stated (Rosh Hashana 21b) on (Psalms 8:5), "and you have made him slightly less than the angels/God." And therefore it stated with him, that he received - meaning to say, that everything that was fitting for him to receive, he received at Sinai. Such have the commentators explained.  
<b>and the prophets passed it on to the men of the Great Assembly:</b> [Meaning] to say that even though not all of the Assembly were prophets, the entire Torah was passed on to them, as it was passed on to those who preceded them. But from here on - as the generations declined - not the entire thing was passed on. But [rather] everyone received it according to his ability. And nonetheless, the [portion of] the Torah that was in his hand was a transmission to him, [that had been passed on] one man from another [going back] to Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - from Sinai.
<b>the Great Assembly:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that they were called this since they restored the crown to its original splendor, etc... Yirmiyahu and Daniel came but did not say, “mighty and awesome:" Yirmiyahu said (Jeremiah 32:18), the Power, the great and mighty Lord of hosts is His name." Daniel said (Daniel 9:4),”the great and awesome" and did not say, "the mighty."
<b>They said three things:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained [that these are three things] that contain within them the preservation of the Torah. And in Mishna 10 of Chapter 2, he explains also that [these things] were accustomed to be in their mouths, like he explained, "He would say," below in Mishna 2.
<b>"stand up many students:"</b> They [used] an expression of standing, since from the days of Moshe until the days of Rabban Gamliel, they would study while standing [as Rabbi Bartenura explained at the end of Sotah] and the teacher would sit on a chair (Megillah 21a) - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Yosef ibn Nachmias. And even though this is correct according to the language, nonetheless this is not the intended message - whether they should stand or sit. And why does it state, "and stand up?" It should have stated, "and teach," since this is the intended message. Hence it appears to me that it states, "and stand up many students," [meaning to say] to stand them up on their feet, that they should not slip. This is to say, to stand them up on their feet in understanding the truth of the Torah. As this is [something's] standing and preservation, as falsehood has 'no feet,' as in the way of the Psalmist (Psalms 73:2), "my feet were almost pushed away." And since it wanted to say, "many," therefore it was necessary to mention the standing - since, even though they were many, even with all that, the study should be in the manner that they will stand [and] be preserved upon the truth. As without this, it is not [considered] the standing up of students. But [rather] they would be gazing [and] laying down in a trance of foolishness. It comes out for us from these general words that we do not observe this ethic unless we teach the truth and that which is just, nothing else. And see what I will write, with the help of Heaven, in Mishna 6.

Mishnah 2

<b>”The world stands:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "The world was only created, etc." And about the mishnah at the end of our chapter, it is written in Midrash Shmuel, “There are books found,  that have the textual variant, 'the world was created.'”
<b>"On the Torah:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Had Israel not received Torah, the heavens and the earth would not have been created, as it is written (Jer. 33:25), “Were it not for my covenant, etc." And since it was difficult for him, as 'service and acts of kindness are [also a part  of] Torah, therefore he explained [Torah here] as its acceptence; and the explanation of the verse would be, “If not for my covenant” that you accepted, “night and day, also the laws of the heavens and the earth I would not have set.” And see similar to this at the end of Chapter 3 of Nedarim. And this is difficult to me, since if so, “on the Torah” which it stated is not a warning at all; and [so] it is not similar to the others. And hence it appears to me that the Torah [here] is [referring to] reason and Torah study. And this is [the understanding] of that which is written, “if not for my covenant (which is studied) night and day.” [This is] as the matter is stated (Yehoshua 1), “and you shall reason in it night and day." And in the commentary of Rashi, “for were it not, etc...” is not extant, but rather [just], “on the Torah, as it is stated, 'if not, etc...'” 
<b>"on the [Temple] service:"</b>And they were not precise, as it is not the language of a mishnah nor a bereita, but [rather] the statement of <i>amoraim</i> (scholars form the later part of the Talmudic period.): Rabbi Yakov bar  Acha said that Rav Assi, etc. in Taanit 27b in Chapter 4. And one should be precise [about] the language of the statement, “If it were not for the groupings [involved in the sacrifices], the heavens and earth would not stand.” And if so, it is not a proof that it was because of them that they were created. As behold, it is possible to say that [only] after they were created, they would no longer exist if there were no groupings. But it is not that the groupings were a reason for their creation, [meaning] that they were created for their sake <i>ab initio</i>, as the power of that which preserves a thing that already exists is not as great as the power of that which creates a thing that was not [in existence]. And if so, from where in this statement do we get that the power of [the sacrificial] service is great enough that for its sake was the world put into existence and created. And I found about this statement, that it is also extant in the chapter [entitled] Bnei Ha'eer in the tractate Megillah 31a. And there, it is stated like this, “Rabbi Ami said, 'If it were not for the groupings, the heavens and earth would not stand, as it is stated,  “If not for my covenant night and day, also the laws of the heavens and the earth I would not have set” and it is written (Genesis 15:8), “And he said, 'Lord, God, in what way will I know that I will inherit it'” - said Avraham, our father, peace be upon him, “Master of the universe, maybe – God forbid - Israel will sin in front of you, etc.” He said to him, “Take a threefold calf, etc.”'” And he expounds [that], “My covenant” is referring to the covenant between the pieces [just cited] and it stated, “I would not have set.” We infer from this that the [sacrificial] service is a reason for the setting of the world and its creation. And if you will ask, let it be [the case] during the time that the Temple is in existence, but from since it was destroyed, what is there to say; one can answer that the world was created for the sake of His looking forward to the time that the Temple will exist. And also, that behold, it concluded the statement mentioned, “He said in front of Him, 'let it be [the case] when, etc.'” and He answers him, “I have already established the [written] order of the sacrifices: whenever they read about them, I count it for them as if they sacrificed a sacrifice in front of me.” And what is written in the commentary of Rashi on Taanit is confused – since from where did he [derive] to learn it [about this statement]?

Mishnah 3

<b>The man of Sokho:</b> He was the master of the place that was called Sokho. And "man" is an expression [which means] master, as we learn in a mishnah, "my man, [the] High Priest" in tractate Yoma 18. And there, Rabbi Bartenura explained in Mishna 3 of the first chapter, "'My man' is my master." [And see Mishnah Challah 4:10, s.v. the man of Tekoa, etc.]
<b>"Do not be as servants who are serving the master in order to receive a reward:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura expalined, "but rather out of love alone." Meaning to say, that about this he [only] warned that the service be from love only, since it is the essence of service; and not that he meant to say that service on the condition of receiving a reward is forbidden, since [such a one] would be serving God nonetheless. And therefore the perfect Torah did not stop from making known the reward and punishment [that depends upon performance of the commandments]. But if one serves with the hope of reward or the prevention of hurt, behold, he is not on the same level as the one who serves from love, as [the latter] does not have any personal interest in his service at all. And the teacher [of this mishnah] wanted to warn us to be from those that serve from love, but not to exclude the one who serves with the hope of a reward from the category of those that serve [God], as this is not the case. [This is] as their statement in the first chapter of Bava Kamma 10b, "One who says, 'this coin is given to charity in order that my son should live; in order that I should have a share in the world to come' - behold, he is completely righteous." And also, if you do not say like this, you will - God forbid - cut off the feet of the 'haters of Israel' (a euphemism for the Jews), as where is the one who can weigh and where is the one who can count and say that he is someone who serves from love. Would it be good in the eyes of God that anyone who serves and has in mind that the Torah's stipulation - that was told to us from His mouth, may He be blessed - should materialize for him, not receive his goodly reward for this? It is not good for their Master that you should say like this. And so [too] did Rebbi say at the beginning of Chapter 2, "And weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it." And [it is] as I have written there, with Heaven's help. And so [too] in the end of the second chapter, "And the Master of your work is trustworthy, etc." And see over there what I will write about [the statement,] "and know the reception of their reward." And [the statement] of Azariah, brother of Shimon in Zevachim 1:2 proves [it]. And even [the teacher of our mishnah] did not intend this. And I say from his own words can you learn this and that he himself was careful about this, that we should not stumble from his words. As he said, "Do not be as servants, etc." and did not say, "Do not serve in order to receive a reward." And in this way he taught his students [this] in a quick fashion. Rather, he taught by saying, "Do not be like servants, etc;" meaning to say that certainly those that serve in order to receive a reward are [also] servants, but you should not be like them but greater than them and serve from love alone. And I saw from our master, our teacher, the rabbi, Rabbi Loewe from Prague, of blessed memory, in the book, Derekh Chaim that he wrote that therefore did [the teacher of our mishnah] state, "but rather be like servants, etc." and it was not enough for him to state, "Do not be, etc. Since from his statement, "Do not be," it would have sounded like he was negating and forbidding [one] from being "like servants that serve, etc.;" and this is not [correct], as this is not a prohibition, since even one who serves in this way is completely righteous. Rather, he is only coming to teach that there is a level and status still greater than this, and that is the one who serves from love. And hence he was compelled to repeat and say, "but rather be like, etc.;" [meaning] to say that the point of his intention is that you should be "like servants that serve their master not in order, etc," and that this is the greatest level. But he is not intending to say that it is forbidden to serve in order to receive a reward. These are his words and his opinion, of blessed memory. And from here, go and learn that behold this teacher, according to his completeness and his wisdom, was very wise in his words. Since  in the beginning of his words, he taught about this that one should not negate those that serve in order to receive a reward, but [rather] that also those that serve to be repaid to receive reward, he calls servants. And he also added an explanation, to explain: "but rather be, etc.," to say, "Are these not my words that I speak, that you should be [serving without the need for reward]. But not that I intended with my statement, 'do not be, etc.' to forbid. My main intention was just that 'you should be, etc.' to edify you to the most complete level of completion, and not to forbid the other as mentioned." And from here, all the more so should [the mishnah] not be understood according to the words of the teacher the mistake of Tsadok and Beitos, who said that he intended to say that there is no receiving of reward at all here, as is mentioned in the words of Rabbi Bartenura in his commentary on Mishnah 11. But he should have explained it explicitly, that it be explicit for all that hear [it]. (And I saw in Tosefot in the first chapter of Rosh Hashanah 4 at the top, who wrote that our Mishnah relates to gentiles who regret the earlier [good deeds]. To here [is what I saw]. And I wonder, how is it possible to say this, that the teacher chose his case about idol worshippers. And all the more so, since all of these words in Avot they were [constantly] accustomed to say, according to one opinion of Rabbi Bartenura above in Mishnah 2. And also our holy rabbi (Rebbi) should not have placed it in the Mishnah if his words were only about idol worshippers. And my mind was set at ease when I saw the words of [Tosefot] in the beginning of the first chapter of Pesachim 8b at the top, who wrote that [the mishnah] is speaking about a situation that if [a Jew] does not get the good that he was expecting, he wonders, and regrets the [act of] charity that he did, but one who does not wonder and regret, behold, he is completely righteous. And so [too] is it implied in the beginning of Rosh Hashanah and in the first chapter of Bava Batra. And according to this, that which they mentioned idol  worshippers in Rosh Hashanah was only an example, as they wonder [about good deeds when they are not rewarded for them], as it is found over there in the gemara. But our mishnah is about a Jew that wonders. And their words [that were puzzling me] are meant to say that our mishnah is like a case of idol worshippers, etc., [but] is [actually the case] of a Jew that wonders - who is like an idol worshiper who generally wonders.)
<b>reward (<i>peras</i>):</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "It is what a person gives to someone who served him, when he is not legally obligated to give him anything," meaning to say that this is the distinction between a reward and payment. Since payment is what must legally be given. And so [too] did Rambam write. 
<b>"not in order to receive a reward:"</b> And a different version of the text is, "in order not to receive a reward." And I did not understand this version, as it is not applicable to say that he should serve in order and on condition that He should not give him a reward. As it is implied from this that if He would give him a reward, he would not serve Him. And even though the author of Midrash Shmuel wrote - that according to the first version, "Even though he serves without distinction, and not in order, etc., nonetheless, [such a person] knows that in the end the reward will come, and behold he hopes for the reward. But [rather, he should] serve in order not to receive a reward: which is that he explicitly serves in order that he not receive a reward, but [rather] from complete love." Up to here [are his words] - he fixed the matter but not the language [of the alternate text]. And that which he responded to the text [extant] in the book - that behold, even though that he only serves out of love, he [still] knows that the reward will eventually come - I say that this is not the way of one who serves from love.  Since if this is so, there is no greater servant from [want] of reward than this. But one who [truly] serves from love is always coming short in [his] service in his [own] eyes.  And he thinks to himself that he has not served as is fitting to Him, due to his great love for Him, may He be blessed. And so did Hillel say, "And if I am for myself, what am I," as per the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah 14. And not only that, but not only does he not hope with the hope of reward, but he fears for his soul lest he has sinned in his shortcomings in his service and has been guilty. And that is how the teacher [of this Mishnah] ends and says, "and may the fear of Heaven be upon you," and as I will explain. And such was the attribute of the forefathers, since thus did Avraham, our father, peace be upon him - even though he was assured of [having] seed - say afterwards, "and I am going barren." And this is [also what is referred to as] the 'Dread of Yitschak.' And Yaakov was also afraid, lest he was dirtied by sin. This is the inheritance of the servants of God, who serve from love. 'And that which goes up in their heart will not be' a hope for reward at all. And therefore the [alternative] version of the book is the correct one. So does it appear to me. 
<b>"and may the fear of Heaven be upon you:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that "the one who serves out of fear is careful concerning negative commandments" and so [too] did  Rambam explain. And according to what I wrote above, [this statement] is itself a condition of the one who serves from love. And that which they called God, may He be blessed, with the name, "Heaven," is to say that this fear should not be be a fear of punishment, which is also a superficial service and it carries some personal interest. But [rather] the fear that they warned about is a fear (awe) of His greatness, may He be blessed. And this was taught by the name, "Heaven," since His  greatness and power are apparent there though the creatures of the heavens and all of their multitudes and their movements, without a doubt. So does it appear to me. 

Mishnah 4

<b>Yose ben Yoezer, man of Tsreida, etc.:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "All the Tannaim (early teachers), etc." as we learned in Mishnah Chagigah 2:2. And Tosefot explained there (Chagigah 16, s.v. Yose) in the name of the Yerushalmi that the first disagreement in Israel was in their days. And therefore I say that before them the pairs are not mentioned, as there was one leader in [each] generation and none second to him. Which is not the case from those days onwards, when the connection was separated and 'they became like two heads." And, nonetheless, all of their Torah was true, as behold they received it [transmitted by their predecessors]. And the disagreement was only in things that were dependent upon reasoning, to be expounded according to one of the mechanisms though which the Torah is expounded, as Rambam has spoken about at length concerning this in his introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah.
<b>they received from them:</b> Ramah explained  ["from them" to mean] from Shimon and Antigonos. And Rabbi Yosef ibn Nachmias wrote that they first learned in front of Shimon the Righteous and [then] he died, and they had not yet learned their fill and went back to learn in front of Antigonos - [who was] the replacement of Shimon the Righteous - until he also died. And they took his place. Up to here is [what is written] in Midrash Shmuel. And that which he wrote in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Lirma  that the people of their generation received [the transmission] from them, and that it is possible to explain each expression of receiving thus in this chapter does not [appear correct]. Even though there is a bit of a side [to explain] like this, since we did not learn explicitly, "they received from Shimon and Antigonos;" but, nonetheless, it does not appear [correct], since it is not fitting not to mention that they received and to mention that others received from them. And also because the main intention of letting know the transmission which the teacher made known was to teach the chain of transmission which is from Sinai, one man from another until this redactor. And from them it is that he redacted [the Mishnah]. And there are books that have the textual variant, "from him." And Midrash Shmuel wrote in the name of Rashbatz that it is a [more] exact version, if it is substantiated.
<b>"become dirty in the dust of their feet:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained in another explanation: "'That you should sit at their feet, etc.' For so were they accustomed, etc." And it is not difficult concerning that which was explained at the end of Sotah that until Rabban Gamliel died, they would learn Torah standing up, since here, this is what is meant: that if they were sitting, their custon was that the master sits on the bench and the students sit at his feet on the ground. And there also, it did not mean that it was forbidden for them to sit and that they would only learn while standing up. As it was only saying that there was vigor in the world and [so] they would learn standing up in honor of the Torah, but if sometimes something would occur that [would make] them sit - for example, they would be long in the study hall  - here it is saying that "they were accustomed, etc." And also (another possibility is that) it is like Rava (in Megillah 21) who answers the [seemingly contradictory] verses, "and he sat at the mountain" [and] "and I stood at the mountain" - the soft [easy] ones standing up, the difficult ones sitting down. It is [here] no better than [Rava's case of] Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - from the mouth of the Strength (God).
<b>"thirstily (<i>vatzama</i>):"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Like a thirsty person, etc." And so [too] is the language of Rashi. And it appears to me that their textual variant was <i>ketzama</i> (like a thirsty one), with a [Hebrew letter] kaf. And in Midrash Shmuel in the name of R. Y. Ibn Nachemias, "In the six orders of Mishnah of the Yerushalmi, the textual variant is <i>ketzama</i>, with a kaf. And it all ends up to be one explanation - that you should drink their words like the desire of a thirsty one to drink water."  Up to here [are his words.]

Mishnah 5

<b>They so stated with his wife:</b> [These are] the words of Yose ben Yochanan; since his words that he said were accustomed to be in his mouth, but he received them from his teachers. [It is as] Rabbi Bartenura explained in the beginning of our chapter, that all of their words in this tractate are words of transmission [that extend back] to Sinai. And this is also [why] on [the later phrase,] "From this, the sages said, etc.," Rabbi Bartenura explains, "Our holy master wrote it, etc,." and he did not explain like this until here. And the author of Midrash Shmuel wrote, "'They so stated with his wife' - our holy master said it." And so too did he also write in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Ephraim. And [he also wrote] that, "'From this, the sages said' - sages that came after him added to his words." Up to here [are his words]. And so [too] have we found in the end of Sotah that they added after him in the Mishnah - after Rebbi died, etc. But with regards to this explanation, the expression, 'they said,' that was stated by the teacher is difficult to me. And if it was Rebbi that said such on the words of Yose, behold they are the words of an individual, and why did he say, "they said."
<b>all the more so with the wife of his friend:</b> Because of the suspicion [of adultery thereby created]. So did Rashi write. [This is] according to the second explanation that Rabbi Bartenura wrote about, "They so stated with his wife."
<b>"Any time that a man increases, etc. he causes evil to himself, etc.:"</b> The language of Midrash Shmuel: "Any time" - whether when his wife is pure, whether when she is in the days of her impurity, it is not fitting to increase his speech with her. Since if she is menstruant and impure, the speech brings to desire and the desire brings to action. And you can have no greater evil than this, in that he causes evil to himself.  And if she is pure, it would have been better that this time that he sits idly in idle talk, he would [use] to be involved in words of Torah.  And that which it is written, "and neglects the words of Torah" is when he increases conversation with his wife [who is] pure. To here [are his words]. And this is what Rabbi Bartenura [meant when he] wrote, that, "from his words, it appears that it is [speaking about] even when his wife is pure." And Rashi ends, "because he neglects the words of Torah." Up to here [are his words]. And to my hands were brought mishnahs from the Land of Israel of the orders of Zeraim, Kodashim and Taharot. And among them was also this tractate and it was edited [to read], "Anyone who increases conversation, etc."

Mishnah 6

<b>"Acquire for yourself a friend:"</b> The words of Rabbi Bartenura: "And even if you need to acquire him for a large sum and to spend money upon him in order to acquire his love. But with a mentor, it is not relevant to say, 'Acquire for yourself a mentor,' as a [teacher of Torah] must teach for free." And he did not write these words of his with precision. As since he explained the friend (<i>chaver</i>) to be a <i>chaver</i> in an association of Torah study - as he ends, "but with a teacher, etc..., he needs to teach for free" - what is that which he said, "in order to acquire his love?" [According to what he wrote,] he should have said, "in order to acquire his association." But [rather] the beginning of his words are taken form the words of Rambam, and [Rambam] did not state them about an association of study. As this is what he wrote: "'and acquire for yourself a friend' - it mentioned it with an expression of acquisition, etc... as a man must acquire for himself a confidant so that his actions and all of his affairs be bettered, as they said (Taanit 23a), 'either a friend or death, etc.' And he needs to make efforts, etc... so that he brings him to his love, etc." To here are his words.  And in the Midrash Shmuel, [its author] wrote in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Lirma that he had difficulty as to why [Yehoshua ben Parachia] did not warn that one should get students. As, behold, they said (Taanit 7, Makkot 10), "Much have I learned from my teachers, etc... and from my students more than them all." And he gave a reason for this: that the entire endeavor of the students is to learn. Hence, they only learn in the place that their heart desires most or from whom it appears that they can learn from the most. And since he may not be able to find someone who will want to be his student, hence the teacher [of this mishnah] did not warn about them. To here are his words. And our teacher, our master, the teacher, Rabbi Lioeve (Maharal), of blessed memory, wrote in his book, Derekh Chaim, that he did not say, "acquire for yourself a student," as it is not fitting to do this thing; for a man to make himself into a mentor and to take for himself a reputation of importance, to say, "Learn from me," as they do in these lands. To here are his words. And even though their words are the truth and just, in my eyes it appears that the question is not a question from the beginning. As the teacher [of this mishnah] was already preceded by the precursors of his precursors, the men of the Great Assembly, since they said, "and stand up many students." And they were only speaking when the students wanted [to learn under a teacher] as it is impossible to force them. And they were not talking about someone who is unfit to stand up students, as behold, they said, "and stand up;" which means upon the foot of truth, as I explained over there with Heaven's help. And this can only be done by someone who has truth in his hand. And they were not speaking about the arrogant and self-aggrandizing who say, "I shall rule and be a head and a captain of people by the expansion of the academies of students," as all the words [of true teachers] are ethics and humble righteousness. But about the one who has the potential to stand up many students, about him did they say and warn that he should establish many students. [This is] by way of that which is stated (Proverbs 7:26), "and abundant are all of her kill" - this is [in reference] to the student that got to [the level] of judgement and doesn't issue judgement (Sotah 22a). But about the one who has not reached this level and is self-aggrandizing as mentioned, he too is included in (Proverbs 7:26) "many corpses has she fallen." And [this is known] by way of an a fortiori argument (<i>kal vechomer</i>) from the one who has not reached judgement and issues judgment, as that is temporary and at selected times and to a few individuals, whereas this is everyday and to many students - and "that which is mixed up, once it has gone up, it has gone up [and will not change]" - it is an a fortiori argument and a hyper-a fortiori argument that upon him it is said, "many corpses has she fallen" [just like it is said about the one that only issues judgement occasionally]. And it is not a question [to ask], "If so, why did they [not differentiate and] just say, "and stand up many students." Since about this and that which is similar to this, it has been stated (Hoshea 14:10), "and the righteous will walk in them and the wicked will stumble in them." And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote that a [Torah] teacher must teach for free is explicit in Nedarim 4:3. And even though one can take a wage with scripture, - as it is found there - the main warning of the teacher [of this mishnah] to make for oneself a teacher is about the study of the Mishnah and the Gemara - since scripture is 'a measure and not a measure' as is found at the end of the second chapter of Bava Metzia 33a.

Mishnah 7

<b>"Distance [yourself] from a bad neighbor:"</b> It stated an expression of distancing with his neighbor, since a person is close to him. And with an evildoer who is not his neighbor, it was not forced to say, 'distance,' since he is not close. [Rather,] it only warned him not to befriend him. And it said about the neighbor, "bad," and about the one who is not a neighbor, "evildoer" - even though both of them are evildoers - since his being neighbors with an evildoer is bad for [the latter's] neighbor, and his proximity is very harmful. But the evil of an evildoer who is not near to a person does not cause that person any bad - even though he is an evildoer to the Heavens - unless he befriends him. So did he write in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious teacher, Rabbi Yosef Ibn Shoshan. And in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Lirma, he wrote that he was precise [about] why it said, "distance" (<i>harchek</i>) - which is from the causative [form] - and it did not say, "distance oneself" (<i>hitrachek</i>) - which is from the reflexive form. And he said [that the reason is] that if a person comes to live next to the bad neighbor because he doesn't know him, one should distance [this newcomer] and warn him not to dwell [near] him. Up to here [are his words.] And in my eyes it appears that in both of the [cases here], the teacher adopted the language of scripture. With distancing, as it is stated (Proverbs 5:8), "Distance from upon her your path;" and you do not find <i>mitrachek</i> as a causative expression in all of scripture. And with befriending, as it is stated (II Chronicles 20:37), "With your making friends with Achaziyahu the Lord breached your acts." And that is as [the mishnah] ends, "and do not despair of punishment," which it  as it is in this verse [where the punishment comes at the end]. 
<b>"and do not despair of punishment:"</b> And it does not say that he should worry about punishment, since such a thing is a bad trait - the one who worries about punishment; but [rather], "do not despair of punishment." Which is what Haman did when he relied upon his great wealth, and in the blink of an eye, his success reversed itself upon him. And this is [the meaning] of the expression, 'do not despair' - Derekh Chaim. 

Mishnah 8

"<b>Do not make yourself like the judges' advisers:</b>" Rabbi Bartenura explains, "Like those people that set up and arrange the claims of a litigant before the judges. As it is forbidden for a person to reveal the judgment to one of the litigants and to say to him, 'Do the following, etc.'" And even though the beginning of his words appear that he is explaining 'judges' advisers' [to mean] that they themselves arrange [the claims] like this in front of the judges - and that is how Rashi explained in the last chapter of Sotah 47b, "The ones that whisper secrets, whisper to the judges to open up a path to the merit of this one or of the guilt of the other one." Up to here [are his words]; and like the explanation of Rashi in the fourth chapter of Ketuvot 52 - but from the end of his words, you learn that also the beginning of his words are that they are arranging and setting up the claims of the litigants [who will come] in front of the judges. [And] not that they themselves give reasons in front of the judges, but rather that by their revealing [them] to the litigant - by saying to him, "Do this;" behold, it is as if they are making claims in front of the judges. And so [too] did Rashi explain here [and] also in Chapter 20 of Shabbat 139. And these are the words of Rambam: "Judges' advisers are individuals that teach claims and laws until people become expert in their cases, such that they compose questions, that when the judge says like this, your answer should be thus - as if  they were setting up the case and the litigants in front of them. And for this are they called 'judges' advisers' - it is as if they set up the cases in front of them." Up to here [are his words.] And according to this the word, 'advisers,' implies [the] two words, '[of] the cases before,' and is not relating to the word, 'judges' alone. And in the book, Lev Avot, [its author] writes that he heard that thus is its explanation: that he is like a judges' adviser himself, since the judgment that the judges decide to render this one innocent is on account of that which he ordered [the litigant's] claims - and, if so, this one advised the judges to make this judgment. Up to here [are his words.] And in Midrash Shmuel, [the author] writes in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Matatyah Hayitzhari and these are his words: "It should not enter your mind, that he will make as a claim for the litigant words of iniquity and trickery, as such ones are complete evildoers, but [rather] even [when he uses] words of truth and the case changes on account of what he does. [It is] like that [case] in the chapter [entitled] Naara Shenitpateta (Ketuvot 52b) in the case of [the payment for] healing [a man's widow] that has no limits [and so] is like sustenance (<i>mezonot</i>) and is payed from the estate of the husband, [wherein] Rabbi Yochanan advised them, "Set a fixed amount [with a physician] for the healing so that it will be something that has a limit [and no longer considered like sustenance]." Up to here [are his words]. And from this came out for me an explanation of the words of Rabbi Bartenura who wrote, "and to say to him, 'Do the following.'" And [ostensibly] he should have said, "You should claim the following," like the words of Rambam. But rather my opinion is that [he is only speaking about] bringing up advice for [the litigant] to do an act like that [case] of Rabbi Yochanan and so also with Rabbi Nachman in the chapter [entitled] Hakotev (Ketuvot 86a) [wherein] he brought up advice to [bring about] the relinquishment of a marriage contract. But it is possible that according to Rabbi Bartenura one need not be pious and refrain from teaching him to order his words and his claims, so long as there is no falsehood in it. But certainly for Rambam it is not the case, but rather even the ordering of words more generally is also forbidden. And these are the words of the teacher, Rabbi Yonah which are brought in Midrash Shmuel: "It is not speaking here about one who teaches false claims to his friend, since a man like that is completely wicked and this is a big sin - and [in this tractate] we are dealing with words of piety. Rather [it is speaking] about one who orders the claims that are in his mouth and finds reasons for them, and he sets it up in front of the judges and reveals the judgement to him. And he says that it is not fitting to do so, as they will suspect him." Up to here [are his words]. And from the words of them all we have learned that this is why the teacher said, "like judges' advisers" with a [Hebrew letter] kaf [which as a prefix means, 'like']. Since if he had said, "Do not make yourself a judges' adviser, it would have been implied that the setting up [of legal cases] is forbidden by law and this is not [true]. And it also appears to me by being precise that [the reason] the teacher said, "yourself" and did not teach it with brevity - "do not be, etc." - is because of [the case] of Rabbi Yochanan.  As we say in the gemara, that this is why he gave advice - since he was a relative and reasoned [that it was a case of] 'from your flesh, do not turn away.' And afterward, he had regret and said, "We have made ourselves like the judges' advisers," since he reasoned that it is different with an important person. And we infer from here that if he was not an important person, what he did would have been fine because of 'from your flesh, do not turn away.' And that is [the reason for] what the teacher said, "Do not make yourself;" which is to say according to yourself, since you are an important person - do not make [your self] like the advisers, but besides that it is certainly permissible. And according to that, even not for his relative is it permissible when he is not an important person. And that which Rabbi Yochanan said, "'From your flesh, do not turn away,'" is [because] if it were not for that, why should he do this to make one lose against the other, as 'what did he see that made the blood of this one redder.' And so [too], the warning of the teacher [of this mishnah] is only for an important person, since he was precise to teach, "yourself." But when he is not an important person, there is not even piety [in abstaining from helping a litigant] as he is not teaching him to claim falsehoods. However we have learned from Rabbi Yochanan, who said, "Because of 'from your flesh, do not turn away,'" that if [it was] not thus, he would have turned away, and not from the angle of piety but rather what is it to him to advantage one and make the other lose. But if he is his relative and [the one giving the legal aid] is not an important person,  [the latter] should [do so] and also fulfill, 'from your flesh, do not turn away.' So does it appear in my eyes. (But from the language of Rashi - "An important person is different, as [people] learn from him and there will be those that will do [this] even not for relatives;" to here [are his words] - if so, anyone who [does this] not for relatives is included in the warning of "do not make, etc.")  
<b>"they should be like evildoers in your eyes:"</b> But not [that] both of them be like righteous ones. As, if so, he will not search out their claims and he will judge each one as meritorious and not get down to the truth of the case. But when both of them are like evildoers in his eyes, he will search out the claims of each one and the trickery of each one and - because of that - he will get down to the truth of the case. It can also be said that since, at the very least, one of the litigants is going against the law, and so [too] the second litigant that has a case against him, he is [also] like [the first] - as they said like this concerning an oath (Shevuot 39a): "Those that stand there say one to another, 'please remove yourselves from upon the tents of these wicked people, etc.'" And they said there (39b and 47b), "'An oath of the Lord shall be between them' - [this] teaches that the oath rests upon both of them." And all of this is because since this one has a case with him, they are both called evildoers until they accept the judgement. And then, they are both righteous, as acceptance of the judgement after the disagreement that they had between them is on account of the righteousness that is within them - Derekh Chaim. <b>"when they received the judgment:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "Such that you should not suspect, etc." As I would have thought, "Since there is [a reason] to suspect [here], this one is not included in, 'and judge every person as meritorious.'" [Hence,] it is necessary [to write this in the Mishnah]. 

Mishnah 9

<b>"But be careful with your words, lest from them they learn:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained [that "they"] is the litigant or the witnesses. And even though, in the first part [of this mishnah], we only taught, "witnesses," nonetheless, go after the reason - "lest, etc." - which is certainly also applicable to the litigant. And also as, "but (and) be careful, etc." is a matter on its own. And therefore, when it said, "they learn," it was said about all who can learn. And [so] all implies the witnesses and the litigants. 

Mishnah 10

<b>Shamaya and Avtalyon:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "They were righteous converts." And so [too] did Rambam write in his introduction to his essay, Mishneh Torah. And it is implied that they themselves were righteous converts, but it is not plausible. Since they were the nassi and the head of the court as Rabbi Bartenura explained in Mishnah 4, and a convert is not fit to judge, as Rabbi Bartenura has explained in Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:2 (and all the more so to be the head of the court, as we have learned in Mishnah Horayot 1:4). And this is the language of our Rabbi Lioeve (Maharal) in the book, Derekh Chaim, "Shamaya and Avtalyon said that they were from the congregation of converts. And so is it attested in Gittin 57b and Yoma 71b. But the explanation is not that they themselves were converts - since, if so, how is it possible to appoint them as nassi and head of the court? Rather, they [were only descended] from converts but their mother was certainly Jewish, and therefore they were permissible to appoint as nassi and head of the court. But there are those that explained that they themselves were converts - certainly this is a complete mistake." Up to here [are his words.]
<b>"Love work:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "Even if he has from what to sustain himself, etc." - since now he is not doing work for its reward but for its own love, and that is [what is meant by] that which it said, "Love [work]", and it did not say, "Do work." And Rabbi Bartenura wrote that idleness leads to distraction. This is what Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said in Mishnah Ketuvot 5:5 (Page 59a). And I am surprised, since over there (Ketuvot 61b), the law is decided like Rabbi Eliezer, that idleness leads to promiscuity. And the practical difference between [the two positions] is one who plays (gambles): Since [if the obligation is] because of distraction, it is not [an issue if he is occupied by playing], but [if it is] because of promiscuity, it is [an issue] as was explained by Rabbi Bartenura there. And it is possible to say that only with a woman does licentiousness apply, as women are weak willed when it comes to being seduced. And so do you find in the Chapter ahead, Mishna 7, "The more maidservants, the more licentiousness;" but with the increase of servants, we learn, "the more theft." 
<b>"hate lordship:"</b> And Rabbi Bartenura explained in the [second] explanation, "As lordship buries those that have it." As the Master said in the first chapter of Sotah 13 and Berakhot 55a, "Why did Yosef die [before his brothers]? Because he conducted himself with lordship." (And he should distance himself with the force of hatred, the opposite of loving work, according to the commentary of Tosafot Yom Tov. So does it appear to me - Ed.)
<b>"and do not become familiar with the government:"</b>Rabbi Bartenura explained, "In order to receive lordship through it." And Rashi ends, "Since they only bring a person close for their own need." And, if so, this is [the same as] Mishna 3 in the following chapter, and see there. 

Mishnah 11

<b>"Sages, be careful with your words:"</b> That which he warned the Sages, was not [with] the intention that other people are not warned about this; but rather if a doubt arises about the words of the Sages, the listeners will come to a general mistake, which is not the case with the words of a commoner, to whose words we are not attentive. Therefore, he warned the Sages more - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan.
<b>"a place of evil waters:"</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "That show sides of the Torah that are not like the law (<i>halakha</i>), and this is a term for 'evil waters.'" And the language is cut up (inverted), since evil waters is a term for sides of the Torah that are not like the law. And the language of Rambam: "Evil waters is a term for heresy."
<b>"and the students who follow after you will drink:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "As happened to Antigonos, the man of Socho, with  Tsadok and Beitos, etc... and they and their students became heretics." And similar to this did he write, in the last chapter of Mishnah Yadayim 4:6, "Groups of Jews gathered with them, etc." And this is not exactly the same as the words of the teacher, who is only teaching because of "the students that come after you." And I found in the commentary of Rashbam [on the] chapter [entitled], Yesh Nochalin (Bava Batra 115a), who wrote in the name of Avot DeRabbi Natan a story of Tsadok and Beitos who were teaching their students the words of Antigonos, "Do not be like servants, etc." and the students erred, etc. And so [too] did I see in Avot DeRabbi Natan, Chapter 5.

Mishnah 12

<b>"Pursuing peace:"</b> As the matter is stated (Psalms 34:15), "seek peace and pursue it."
<b>"loving the creatures:"</b> Because they are the creatures of the Holy One, blessed be He, therefore it is fitting that you should love them. And [it is] also [fitting] that the love should be from this side and not from any other side - for example, because of the benefit that comes to you from them. And close to this [is the explanation] in Midrash Shmuel.
<b>"bringing them closer to Torah:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that when Aharon would know about someone that he committed a sin, he would befriend him, etc. And it is a little difficult, as this appears to contradict the statement of Nitai of Arbel who said, "Do not befriend an evildoer." And I saw in Chapter 12 of Avot DeRabbi Natan, "What does the verse (Malachi 2) teach , 'and he brought back many from sinning?' When Aharon was walking on the way; if he ran into an evil man, he would greet him. On the morrow, that man would want to commit a sin, [but] he would say, 'woe is me, how can I lift (my eyes afterwards) and see Aharon - I would be embarrassed from him, since he greeted me. It comes out that that person would prevent himself from a sin." To here [are its words]. And so [too] did Rambam write, "He would greet him first and he would become beloved to him and he would increase his talking with him. And that man would be embarrassed inside, etc."

Mishnah 13

<b>"Spread (<i>Negad</i>) a name, lose his name:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "He who extends his name, etc." And so [too] did Rambam explain. And in Derekh Chaim, he is precise about the change in language, as from the beginning, he teaches, "a name," and afterwards, "his name." And he explains that this is what he is saying: <i>Negad shema</i> - meaning to say, the name of dominion, <i>nagid</i> (noble). And this indicates spreading, but it is not fitting; rather [it is better] to lose the name of one having dominion, since lordship buries, etc. And there are those that have the textual variant, "Spread a name, lose a name," with a [Hebrew letter,] alef. And in Midrash Shmuel, "'Spread a name' - one who spreads his name to make for himself a name, like the name of the great ones, loses his name, that he had before. And he ends up 'bald' (lacking a name) from this and from that." And in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan, he wrote that the correct version is both of [the times, 'name' is spelled] with [the Hebrew letters,] shin, mem, alef. And about that which he stated it in the language of translation (Aramaic), see the end of our tractate. 
<b>"and one who does not add, ceases:"</b> And Kessef Mishneh in Chapter 3 of the Laws of Torah Study (Mishneh Torah) explained, "That since he says, 'spread a name' - meaning to say, one who learns in order to enhance his name (fame) - [will] 'lose his name;' lest you say in your heart, 'I will no longer learn - as maybe my learning will be for my name, and it will be lost, etc.' To this he said, 'and one who does not add, will cease' certainly - as one who learns and stops is more difficult than everything. And concerning the one who [even] before he learned, says that he will not learn - to this, he says, 'he is liable to die.' And this is not [as bad as] 'cease,' since here he is [only] obligated in the death penalty, but if he has a merit, it suspends it for him." To here are his words. And this is not like the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura, who explains that "one that does not learn" is worse than "one who does not add." 
<b>"and one uses the crown:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains, "The crown of Torah." And that which [the Mishanh] stated plain, 'crown,' and did not explain, 'of the Torah' is because all of the crowns besides it are nothing - Midrash Shmuel in the name of R. Y. Ibn Shoshan. 

Mishnah 14



Mishnah 15

<b>(”Make your Torah fixed:”</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "Such that you are not strict, etc." And this is not like the opinion of House of the father of Rabban Gamliel, who was from the House of Hillel, as per later. Since behold, they were strict, etc., as we have learned in Chapter 2 of Beitzah and Mishnah Eduyot 3:11.)
<b>"and receive, etc.:"</b> See the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura in Mishnah Avot 3:12 and what I wrote there.

Mishnah 16

<b>Rabban Gamliel said:</b> And he was the grandson of Hillel, as we said in the first chapter of Shabbat 15, “Hillel and Shimon Gamliel and Shimon were the leaders during the time of the [Temple] for a hundred years.” And the commentators explained that for this reason was there no expression of receiving written from here on – since disagreement increased in Israel from the time of the students of Shammai and Hillel. And the Torah became like two Torahs, hence it is not applicable to say, 'receiving' with them, as the Torah of each and every sage was not defined and received and transmitted as it was with the earlier ones. But to me it appears that if it was for this [reason], the teacher would not have refrained from teaching that they received. As behold, they did receive the main parts of the Torah and there is no disagreement in it in any way, as Rambam explained in detail in his introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah. But there is no difficulty to begin with, as in Chapter 2, Mishnah 8, we learned, “Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai received from Hillel and Shammai, etc."
<b>and do not frequently tithe by estimation:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained “the one who separates, etc... if he adds, etc... his tithes are disarrayed” since untithed produce is mixed in with them. Rambam, Laws of Tithes, Chapter 1. And so [too] did Rashi write in the second chapter of Kiddushin 52. And in the fourth chapter of Eruvin 9, he concludes, “which is not the case with priestly tithes (<i>terumot</i>), which has no measure. And see the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah Terumot 4:6. And in Midrash Shmuel, it is written in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan and these are his words: "It is a wonder in my eyes why he did not completely forbid to tithe except by measuring. And let it say, 'Do not tithe by estimation.' What is [meant by] 'do not frequently (literally, increase)?' And therefore I say that the intention is that  even if you intend to increase the tithes and to give more than the measure [it it forbidden], lest you err in your estimate." And Tosefot in Gittin 31 (in the third chapter) agrees that they did not forbid it except when one has the intention to increase and increases [tithes] on purpose. [They learn this] from that which we learn in Mishnah Terumot 4:6, "More praiseworthy then all three of them" - it is implied that there are three [legal] possibilities [even though only two are explicitly mentioned, such that the third possibility implied in the mishnah] is estimation. And so [too] did Rabbi Bartenura explain there. We learn from this that even according to the Sages, estimation is not forbidden - and that is when he doesn't intend to increase [the tithe beyond its measure]. And nonetheless, according to Rambam that I [cited] there it is forbidden [even] without intention. And so [too] are the words of Rash there. And our teacher in Derekh Chaim explains that our mishnah is like Abba Eliezer ben Gomel - who Rabbi Bartenura mentions in the Mishnah Demai 5:2 – who holds that even the priestly tithe from the tithe  (<i>terumat maaser</i>), that has a measurement, is taken by estimation; and certainly with tithes also does he hold like this. And so [too] is it found in the gemara in Bekhorot 59, and it is as is written in the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah 7 in the last chapter of Bekhorot. And that is why he says "do not frequently," [meaning] even though the Torah permits you to tithe by estimation, nonetheless, do not do it frequently in order to avoid a doubt. To here are his words. And it is not difficult [such that one could ask], "What is different about [the main tithe as opposed to other types of tithes] that the mishna [specifically mentions] tithes." Since 'tithes' is a general name for all of the gifts that are from the [produce] of the land, as I have written is the language of the Yerushalmi Ma'asrot 4:2. And see the beginning of Mishnah Demai 4. But I saw in the commentary of Rash on Mishnah Terumot 1:7, who wrote that it appears that Abba Eliezer ben Gomel does not reason like that [which is written], "Do not frequently, etc." And so [too] did the Tosefot in Gittin and Bekhorot mentioned above write. 

Mishnah 17

<b>Shimon, his son:</b> And he was from the matyrs of the [Roman] government (<i>harugei hamalkhut</i>). And at the end of the first chapter of Keritot 8a, we learned, "Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, 'By this sanctuary, I will not sleep until it will be [sold] for a dinar.'" And perforce, this Rabban Shimon is not the one mentioned later at the end of our chapter, since [the latter] was not [a teacher] in the days of the Temple, since they only mentioned up until the second Shimon in the first chapter of Shabbat 76. And maybe when he spoke out this statement, he had not yet risen to the greatness of the title, 'Rabban' - similar to Ben Zakkai in Mishnah Sanhedrin 5:2. And even though I saw another reason about this in the book, Ten Essays, I have written what appears [correct] to me. 
<b>"better than silence:"</b> And that is the textual version in the book, Midrash Shmuel. And in some books, they have the variant, "except silence." And so [it is] in the book, Derekh Chaim.
<b>"and it is not the study, etc.:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And you should know, etc." Since if it did not come as a proof about the above, it would have been fitting that this would have been preceded by "and whoever increases words, etc.," as that would [otherwise] be more fitting to put next to "and I did not find anything better for the body than silence."

Mishnah 18

<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel:</b> He is the grandson of Shimon who is mentioned in the previous mishnah. And this is the father of Rebbi, who is [known as] our holy rabbi, and with him does the second chapter begin.
<b>"the world stands:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[Meaning] the settlement of people is preserved." And this explanation works well, so that you do not query that which we learned in Mishnah 2, [that] there are three other things upon which the world stands. And even though Rabbi Bartenura explained there that it is about the creation of the world - that the world was created for their sake - nonetheless, there would also not be a need for the preservation of the world, without these three. That since they were the cause that the world be created when it was not, all the more so would they be a reason that it exist once it was created. As what was not [in existence, came to existence] for their sake - all the more so, what was [in existence, should exist] for their sake. Hence, Rabbi Bartenura explained that those [items mentioned] here are spoken about the settlement of people and not about the reason for the existence of the world generally. As behold, Torah, service and acts of lovingkindness can exist with people even though they are not settled together properly, [the latter] as a result of there not being, judgment, truth and peace. As there would be God's remnants - the precious few - through which the three pillars of the Mishnah of Shimon the Righteous would be preserved. And do not wonder [about the fact] that they said (Berakhot 17), "The world was only created for the sake of Chanina, My son." And they also said (Ibid., 6b), "The world was only created to command this one," about the verse, "This is all of man." And see what I wrote at the end of Mishnah Sotah 3:4.
<b>"the world stands:"</b> And a textual variant is, "exists." And in Derekh Chaim, he wrote that it is the correct version.
<b>"as it is said (Zachariah 8:16), 'Judge truth and the justice of peace in your gates.'"</b> It is in Zachariah 8:16.  And above it is written, "When I contemplated to do bad to you, etc... so I repented, contemplated in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Yehuda; do not fear. These are the things that you shall do, etc." And in the explanation of Rashi, [he wrote,] "judge in your gates" and he placed next to it, "maybe the Lord of Hosts will grace." Up to here [are his words]. And so [too] was written in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbam. And 'this one did not approach that one,' as "maybe [He] will grace" is in Amos 5:15 - it is stated, "Hate evil and love good and establish justice at the gate, maybe [He] will grace, etc." And also in Rashi's explanation and in the Mishnah of Tiberias, the verse is not [in the text of the mishnah].

Mishnah 1

<b>"Who is the wise one:"</b>Rabbi Bartenura explained, "who is fitting to be lauded by his wisdom." And one can query from that which Yirmiyahu said (Jeremiah 9:24-5), "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, nor let the rich man glory in his riches; But rather let him that glory glory in this, that he understands and knows Me." And it appears to me that it is not difficult, since our teacher [of this mishnah] reasons that which is written, "But rather... that he understands and knows Me," is itself included in the wisdom, the might and the wealth that he mentioned. And so did [Yirmiyahu] say, "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, etc.; but rather" in the wisdom that "understands and knows Me." And "let not the mighty man glory in his might, etc.; but rather" in the might that "understands and knows Me." And "let not the rich man glory in his riches," etc.; but rather" in the riches that "understand and know Me." And therefore he asked, "who is the wise one, etc." and so with all of them by way of a question; to say that since the verse said in an undifferentiated way, that there is a wise man that can glory, and also a mighty man and also a rich man, one should ask who is that the verse intended. And he investigated and found that it is a wise man "who learns from all men." And Rabbi Bartenura explained that it is found that [such a one's] intention is for the sake of Heaven - and this is exactly [one that] "understands and knows Me." And the mighty man [intended] is the one "who conquers his impulse" and that is might that is for the sake of Heaven, such that he not sin in front of Him. [And] there is no greater [example] of "understands and knows Me;" as the goal of this knowledge is to [be in] fear in front of Him and keep his commandments. And the rich man [intended] is "He who is happy with his lot" and is not confused by his wealth and so turns all of his days to the service of Heaven, and this is also "understands and knows me." And therefore it is stated, "'You will be happy' in this world, and 'it will be well with you' in the world to come." And they said in the first chapter of Berakhot 8a, "He who benefits from the work of his hands is greater than the fear of Heaven, etc. And this is also from this reason, as if he is one who is God-fearing but does not suffice and is confused by his wealth, he will not be free to do the service of God, may He be blessed.
 <b>"as it says, 'I have acquired understanding from all my teachers:'"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "and the end of the verse is, 'since your testimonies are my conversation' - which means to say, 'I would learn Torah from all my teachers.'" [Since the prefix represented by the Hebrew letter <i>mem</i> which has been understood here as 'from' can also be understood as 'than,' it should be understood] that it should not be explained that it means to say, that he became more learned than his teachers, as this is not a novelty. Since after a person has learned from his teacher, he becomes wise and learned in his studies and it is not a novelty that he become more learned than what his teachers taught him - Derekh Chaim. And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "'since your testimonies are my conversation' [...] 'as all of my intentions were for Heaven alone,'" is since all of my conversation is about Torah.
<b>"He who conquers his impulse:"</b> The evil impulse is called 'the impulse' without differentiation on account of its coming first and governing the body by itself [before being joined by the positive impulse] - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yosef Karo. And he also explained that it is his impulse that is particular to him and has become powerful in him more than the positive impulse has become powerful and particular in him, as the nature of man leans more to the evil impulse. And see what I have written on Mishnah 9 [in the previous chapter] about "whose fear of sin, [etc.]."
<b>"as it says, 'slowness to anger is better than a mighty person'" (but it can also be read as, 'good is slowness to anger from might'):</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that thus is the explanation of the verse, ["Good is] slowness to anger that comes from the angle of the might, etc." Since if it were not like this, but rather that the explanation of the verse was that slowness of anger is better than a mighty person, it would be difficult - why [should it be considered better], as if it is coming from the angle of [having] a soft nature, it is not good. [So does] it appear to me.
<b>"'You will be happy' in this world:"</b> as you will not be in need from [other] creatures; and "in the world to come," as since he benefits from his [own] effort, he does not come to theft, and he inherits both worlds - Rashi.

Mishnah 2

<b>"Like the strict ones" (<i>kebechamurot</i>):</b> In other versions, [this phrase] is not included. And in versions that include it, it is due to confusion with the beginning of Chapter 2, as there we learn, "be as careful with a easy (light) commandment as with a hard (weighty) one." And if we do include it, it needs to be "as to a strict one" (<i>kelechamura</i>). And in a tractate Avot that came to my hands from the Land of Israel, the [phrase], "like the strict ones," is erased.
<b>"from a sin:</b> And we do not learn [here], "an easy [sin]," as we do with a commandment. As that which we learned [concerning a mitzvah], "easy," means that it is easy for person to do it. And all sins are easy for a  person to do and they are all enjoyable for people. Hence it is not applicable to teach, "from an easy sin" - Derekh Chaim.
<b>"and the reward for one sin is another sin:"</b> Since God, may He be blessed, leaves him to his evil nature. But not that he is helped from Heaven [to do more sins], as was written by Rabbi Bartenura concerning "the reward of a mitzvah." As we say [Yoma 38] (Shabbat 104a), "One who comes to purify himself, he is helped [by God], one who comes to defile himself, [the way] is made open for him." And so [too] did Midrash Shmuel explain in the name of Rabbenu Yonah.

Mishnah 3



Mishnah 4

<b>"Be humble in spirit:"</b> Midrash Shmuel has a textual variant [that follows this phrase with] "in front of every man." And see Mishnah 10.
<b>"for the hope of (<i>tikvat</i>) mortal man is with the worms:"</b> Rambam explained that his end is to return to the worms. And I found similar to this in Rashi on Proverbs 11:23, on the verse, "The desire of the righteous is only good, the hope of the evildoers is wrath," where he explains, "They are certain and hope for <i>Geheinnom</i>." To here [are his words]. We infer from this that since he is certain that it will be thus, it is plausible to say about it, "hope." And [the author of] Derekh Chayim wrote, "This is the reason that we do not learn, 'since your hope;' because no man hopes to be worms, but rather this is what he meant to say, 'that every mortal is projected and set to become worms.'" And he said that [the word,] mortal [has the same numerical equivalent] as man-person (<i>adam eesh</i>), from the angle of the connection of earth (<i>adamah</i>) with humanity (<i>eeshiut</i>) - meaning to say that his faculties were [embodied in] flesh - [so that] his end would be with the worms. To here [are his words]. And behold, he was not concerned about the [the fact that the numerical equivalent of] mortal [comes out to be] one more (as this number one indicates the connection between earth and humanity). And in Midrash Shmuel, it is written in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed, "This is the explanation of our mishna, 'be lowly of spirit' in front of all those who insult you, and do not answer him, 'since the hope of mortal man' that is insulting you 'is with the worms' and [so], why should you be concerned with his voice. And his words are based on the words of [the prophet], peace be upon him, Isaiah 51:7-8, 'do not fear the insult of a mortal and from their curses do not be dismayed; Since the moth will consume them like cloth, etc.'" To here [are his words]. Also written in Midrash Shmuel is "that 'the hope of' is as it is [plainly] understood; and its explanation is that the hope of mortal man and his desire and wish is not be buried like a donkey." To here [are his words]. And I say that even though every man certainly hopes and looks forward to the burial of a man, nonetheless it is not his hope and his wish [to be] with the worms. Rather if he could be buried and not be overcome by worms, [only] then it would be good for him. And all the more so, since we have found several [people] about which they, of blessed memory, testified were not overcome by worms (Bava Batra 17a). And there is a story of significance [testifying to this as well] about Rabbi Elazer bar Shimon in the chapter [entitled] He who Rents Workers (Bava Metzia 83a). Hence I say that what brought all of the commentators, may their memory be blessed, to hesitate about the meaning of this word (<i>tikvat</i> which is normally translated as the hope of) is because they thought that its root was <i>kuf-vav-hey</i>, and it is not. Rather its root is <i>kuf-vav</i>, as per [its usage] (Isaiah 28), "a command to a command, a line (<i>kav</i>) to a line." And the second <i>tav</i> [in the word <i>tikvat</i>] is not replacing a <i>hay</i> but rather just an addition as in <i>tiferet</i> [and] <i>tilboshet</i>. And so [too] do you find [it in the verse] (Joshua 2), "the line of (<i>tikvat</i>) scarlet thread." And from this [usage], we can explain, "a line to a line" [in Isaiah] as an expression, [denoting] a measuring string (a type of yardstick), meaning to say, "a measure for a measure, with a measuring string." And from this itself we can explain [the phrase in Proverbs above,] <i>tikvat reshayim evrah</i> - that [evildoers] are judged according to their measuring string [that measures their evil] for wrath, fury and distress. And it is from this that our teacher stated that the <i>tikvat</i> of mortal man is with the  worms, since his measuring string are the worms. So does it appear to me. [And later I saw in Bereishit Rabbah, Parshat Bereishit, "'<i>yikvu hamayim</i>' - a measure was made for the waters. How is this? As you say (Zachariah 1:16), 'and a [measuring] line was extended over Jerusalem.'"]
<b>"Whoever desecrates the Name of Heaven secretly:"</b> And you [may] ask, behold, Rabbi Bartenura explained in Mishnah Yoma 8:8 that desecration of the Name (<i>chillul Hashem</i>) is [committed by] one who sins and causes others to sin; and I wrote there, that this is one who sins and others learn from him, and so [too] did Rabbi Bartenura write in Chapter 5, Mishnah 9 later on; if so, you don't find it "secretly." And one can answer as it is written in Derkh Chaim, that that which it states, "secretly" is not to say that it is [completely] secret; just that not many know about it, etc. He also [gave another explanation]: for example, [in the case of] ten Torah scholars in a group, and one of them stole or went into the house of prostitutes and it is not known which one it was, etc. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote in the name of Rabbenu Yonah that the desecration [of the Name of Heaven] in secret that is mentioned here is when one worships idols, which is a desecration, as he does not concede to [God's] divinity; or if he swears falsely, as it is stated (Leviticus 19:12), "And you shall not swear falsely in My name, and desecrate, etc." And in the name of Rabbenu Ephraim, [he wrote] that our mishnah is about a Torah scholar who sins secretly, since had he transgressed in public, others would learn from him and it would be a desecration of the Name. To here [are his words]. [And in my eyes that is a great stretch, as behold, nonetheless, he did not do it in public and [so] there is no desecration of the Name. And also the language of our mishnah does not imply this. And accordingly it appears to me that certainly there is no desecration by anyone who does a sin secretly, and our teacher taught, "who desecrates the Name of Heaven." And if you ask, how do you find one who desecrates the Name secretly; it appears to me that it is found with a sin that it is impossible [to do] without being joined by another - for example all of the sexual prohibitions and those that are similar to them. As the woman [he is with] is either raped or if she is seduced it is because she decided on her own that there is no prohibition, since he wanted [it], and there is [thereby] a desecration of the Name. And it is also certainly true that one who eats forbidden foods and the like by himself and no one sees him is not (causing) a desecration of the Name at all.]
<b>"There is no differentiation between intentional and unintentional:"</b> The language of Rambam - you know from the verse that the one who is unintentional [also] has a sin. And because of that he needs atonement with a sacrifice, and God, may He be blessed, said about it, "and he will be forgiven from his sin which he sinned. But he is not like the one who is intentional - God forbid for the straight paths of God, may He be blessed, to equate the intentional with the unintentional in anything. Rather, the intention [of the mishnah] is that with desecration of the Name, whether it is intentional or unintentional, his punishment is in  public. If it was intentional, the punishment is [for an] intentional [sin]; if it was unintentional, the punishment is [for an] unintentional [sin]; but both of of the punishments are in public. To here [are his words.] And so [too] did Rashi explain, that unintentional and intentional were equated concerning it being in public, not regarding all of [their] punishments. And he brought a proof from that which they [would have been] liable to death for bowing down to the idol of Nebuchadnetsar, and they were not killed, as we say (Megillah 12), "They only did outwardly, etc." And Midrash Shmuel explained in the name of Rabbi Itzchak Abarbanel, that concerning the retribution that is in public it is fitting to equate the unintentional and the intentional, to teach that that which he sinned secretly - according to the level of the sin - was public in front of Him, may He be blessed, as there is nothing secret from in front of His eyes. And that is why [the mishnah] went to back to [repeat] "desecration of God's name," to teach that on account of this is the unintentional like the intentional, to get retribution in public; since the desecration of the Name is a sin against Him, may He be blessed, who is always public, etc. To here [are his words]. 

Mishnah 5

<b>"One who studies Torah in order to teach will be given the opportunity, etc:"</b> One should not deduce [that the mishnah means], "to teach" but not to observe - 'for to a man who has such things,' 'says the Lord, "What is it to you that you should recount my statutes?"' And see what I have written later in the name of Kessef Mishneh.
<b>"will be given the opportunity to both study and to teach:"</b> which is to say that he is afforded [the opportunity] that he will study and that his plan to teach will be successful.  And [about one who] studies [only] in order to study, it is not necessary to let us know, as he will certainly be able to fulfill his good plan - that he wanted to learn. But in our case, we are finding out a novelty: that if his plan is in order to teach, he is afforded [the opportunity] to learn - and even his study by himself is successful and not a thing will be reduced, as 'the Lord gives wisdom.' So is it written in Midrash Shmuel. And in Derekh Chaim, [the author] wrote that one who studies in order to study only for himself - and for this, he does not need very much study, it is also certainly true that he will not be afforded the opportunity to do everything that he planned; rather the study of one law will be enough for him. And Kessef Mishneh on Mishneh Torah, Torah Study 3:1 explains "in order to teach:" meaning to say that the intention of his leaning is not for its own sake, [but] rather to become honored in his being the head of the academy (<i>rosh yeshiva</i>), as it is written in the chapter [entitled] Hakones (Bava Kamma 62), "'To love the Lord' - that you should not say, I will read [scripture], etc, I will learn [mishnah], etc. so that I will be an elder and sit in the academy." Or that his intention is to study and get payment, as one who learns a certain trade. [In these cases,] "he is afforded the opportunity to study and to teach" according to his intention but no more. But "the one who studies in order to observe" is one who studies for its own sake, etc. And this is what Rabbi Tsadok comes to let us know - [one] who studies only in order to study, it is a sin, and that is what is written, "do not make [the Torah] into a crown, etc."
<b>"to observe (guard), and to practice:"</b> As even though his intention was only to practice, he is afforded the opportunity also to guard [himself] from sins, so that he should not be like one who dips [into purifying waters] and has an [impure animal] in his hand. So wrote Midrash Shmuel. And in [a text] of Mishnah Avot from the Land of Israel, [the phrase,] "to observe" is erased. And so does it appear [to be correct], since certainly included in "in order to do" is also "to guard  [oneself] from sins. Since, [God] forbid that the intention of the one who wants to practice but not guard [himself] from sins be good in the eyes of God and that he should satisfy His will, and as I wrote at the beginning of the mishnah. But [rather] the intention of "to practice" is to keep [all of the commandments] of the Torah.
<b>"Do not make [the Torah] into a crown, etc.:"</b> meaning to say, not to gain honor through it and to make a livelihood though it. And both of them were necessary to teach (we would not have been able to derive one from the other) - Derekh Chaim.
<b>"and don't use it as a spade with which to dig:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that "payment for teaching is forbidden to take, as it is written, (Deuteronomy 4:14), 'And I did the Lord command at that time to teach you, etc.' - just like I [was taught] for free, etc." And it is written (Ibid., 4:5), "like He commanded me," meaning to say that he commanded me to study (teach) for free. For were it not [understood this way], to what is it referring - as one cannot say that it is [referring to teaching] for payment, as how could he say [about that], "like He commanded me;" and did He command him that it is insufficient not to take reward? And one also cannot say that this is what "like He commanded me" means - "'like' He commanded me, and I am not saying [the commandments] on my own,' as surely the Israelites were not doubting this, as behold, it is written (Exodus 19), "they will believe you forever." But [rather] this is certainly its meaning - "like I commanded you" to study (teach) for free - Rabbenu Nissim Nedarim 37a (Chapter 4). And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And so [too] is a judge, etc., his judgments are nullified," is as we learned in Mishnah Bekhorot 4:6. And see what I wrote over there with Heaven's help. And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote that "the Torah permitted the Torah scholar to derive [tangible] benefit, etc. that he may sell his merchandise" and that they can purchase [merchandise] at the opening of  the marketplace is because these two actions are [ones] that some merchants do for each other as a matter of honor, even without [taking] wisdom into consideration. And a Torah scholar is worthy of being [treated as well] as an honored ignoramus - Rambam. And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And also that he should be exempt from all taxes, yokes, etc." is as is found in Ezra 7:24, "[all priests, etc.,] the king's tax, the poll tax and the meal tax, etc." <b>"Like Hillel used to say:"</b> in the first chapter in Mishnah 13.
<b>"one who benefits from the words of the Torah removes his life from the world:"</b> Any one who benefits in this world through the honor of the Torah, "removes his life from the world:" the explanation [of this] is, from life in the world to come - Rambam.

Mishnah 6



Mishnah 7

<b>"And a false (literally, vain) oath:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained in the second explanation, "that the teacher [of the mishnah] is calling a false oath, a vain oath, etc. As Said Rav Dimi, "said Rabbi Yochanan" - in the beginning of Chapter 3 of Shevuot 20b - "'[making an oath by saying] "I ate," or "I did not eat" is [a] vain [oath].'" And Rashi explained, "the expression, vain (<i>shav</i>), is an expression [that means] not anything, as in (Isaiah 5:18), 'with vain (birth)pangs,' and (Jeremiah), 'In vain have I smitten your children.' Here too, it came out of his mouth in vain. And its prohibition is from, 'Do not take [My name in vain].'" To here [are his words].  And I was surprised [by this explanation] as we learned in Mishnah Shevuot 3:8, "Which is a vain oath?" and we did not learn [there among them] the one of swearing about the past. And one could answer, that which we said over there (Ibid., 21) to the one that argues against Rav Dimi and holds that [making an oath by saying] "I ate," or "I did not eat" is [a] false[oath] (and see the beginning of Mishnah Temurah, s. v. "and absorbs, etc."); saying explicitly, "the Torah included a false oath that is similar to a vain oath: just like a vain oath is about the past" - Rashi explained, "he swore to falsify that which is known to people" - "so too is a false oath about the past included." And so too for Rav Dimi, it can be said that anything [false] in the past is included in swearing to falsify that which is known, [as in] our mishnah. And since the main expression of 'vain' is understood more as that which is known and famous, that is why [the mishna] teaches, "he swears to falsify that which is known," but the same is true of all oaths about the past - that they are included in vain [oaths]. (However, it is found explicitly in the discussion in Chapter 3 of Shevuot 21b, that [one who makes an oath by saying] "I ate," or "I did not eat," is obligated [to bring] a sacrifice. And with a [vain] oath one is exempt, as we learned there; and for this reason, it is written, "this is  a vain oath, to exclude, etc.," as I wrote there. And even though that is according to Ravin, who argues on Rav Dimi; behold we also say over there, at the beginning of page 21, according to Rav Dimi, that [for an oath of] "I ate," or "I did not eat," one is obligated [to bring] a sacrifice.) ובמד"ש כתב בשם הר"י ן' שושן וז"ל תפס שבועת שוא ולא שבועת שקר שאפי' חייב שבועה בדין. והנשבע נשבע באמת. היא שבועת שוא מצד הטוען שיודע האמת. והנשבע על הידוע לאדם היא שבועת שוא עכ"ל. ואתיא מתני' כמאן דפליג אדרב דימי וסבירא ליה אכלתי ולא אכלתי שקר. ואזהרתיה מלא תשבעו בשמי לשקר. וכוותיה פסק הרמב"ם בריש הלכות שבועות. ועיין בפירוש הר"ב פרק דלקמן משנה ט'.
<b>"an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit:"</b> An imbecile in that he brings enmity upon himself. And wicked as he is not concerned whether [the litigant] will steal or make a false (vain) oath.  And on top of that, arrogant in spirit, as it is arrogance of spirit that brought him to this - to give legal decisions and to judge [so as] to acquire [fame] like the [fame] of one of the great ones in the land - Midrash Shmuel.
