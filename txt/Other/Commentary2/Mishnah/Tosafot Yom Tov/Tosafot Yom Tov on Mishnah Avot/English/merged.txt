Tosafot Yom Tov on Mishnah Avot



Avot, IntroductionThis is the language of Rambam (Introduction to the Commentary to the Mishnah): When [Rebbi, the Mishnah's redactor,] finished what was necessary for the judge, he began with Avot, and he did this for two matters. The first is in order to make known that the agreed tradition and transmission is true and correct and [that] a small [group of] people received it. Hence it is fitting to honor a sage (one who is more wise then they) and to place him in an honored station, since jurisdiction arrived to him. As he is in his generation like these were in their generations. And so did they say (Rosh Hashanah 24), "If we were to investigate into the court of Rabban Gamliel, etc." And they said, "Shimshon is in his generation like Shmuel was in his generation." And there is a great deal of ethical teaching for people in this matter, that they should not say, "Why should we accept x judgment or the ordinance of Judge y." And the matter is not like this, as judgment is not from Judge y, but rather from the Holy One, blessed be He, Who commanded us about it, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 1), "as the judgment is to God." But it is all one law and they received it one man from another over the passing generations. And the second matter that he wants to remember in this tractate is the ethical teachings of each sage from among the sages, peace be upon them, in order that we learn the good character traits from them. And nobody needs this thing like the judges. As when ignoramuses are not men of ethics, the damage is not to the masses but only to the [person in question]. But when a judge is not a man of ethics and modest, he damages himself and and he damages [other] people. Hence the beginning of his words in Tractate Avot are ethical teachings for judges, as he stated, "Be deliberate in judgment." And the judge needs to be curbed by all of the matters that that are found in tractate Avot: for example, he should be deliberate in judgment and not hasten the decision, as it is possible that there be a hidden matter in that case, as they stated - peace be upon them - 'a deceptive case;' and likewise, he should not lengthen the case when he knows that there is no hidden matter in it, as this is called, 'torturous judgment;' and he must make efforts in the examination of the witnesses and to be careful at the time of the examination that the witnesses not learn from his words something that will help them in their efforts; and one should not teach a claim to a litigant and this is called, 'judges' advisers;' and he should not profane his soul by association with ignoramuses, lest it be a disgrace; and he should not withdraw from people to the point that they will not be able to see him anytime that they need him, lest a poor person will be hurt; and he should not seek rest and pleasures, lest truth will be lost; and desire should not pull him away. And [Rambam] wrote at great length about the ethics of judges and [the following are] the end of his words: And since it is seen that the judge requires all of these ethical teachings in order to be curbed by them, how pleasant and correct was the placement of the tractate Avot after the tractate Sanhedrin (that deals with judges and court procedures) and that which accompanies it; as it includes all of these ethical teachings and also - in addition to them - matters that bring to separation from the world and honoring the world and its masters and the way of straightness and fear. To here [are his words.] And [Rebbi] gave this tractate the name Avot (Fathers) because, in truth, the sages are the fathers, as in the matter when Elisha said (II Kings 2:12), "my father, my father" about Eliyahu, may his memory be blessed. And so [too] are the students called children, as it is stated (Isaiah 7:3), "and Shear Yashuv, your son."  





Perek 1



Mishnah 1

<b>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[Moshe received it] from the One who was revealed at Sinai." And there, when He was revealed at Sinai, [Moshe] received it with its general principles, its particulars and its inferences and there was no law that was to be innovated [later]. And it is as it is found in Torat Cohanim which is cited by Rashi on Leviticus 25:1at the beginning of Parshat Behar. And to teach this, [the mishna] states "from Sinai." And 'it is not an empty thing,' since, behold, it is a sign of the religion: it is one for its nation, the congregation of Israel that received it. It is complete to its Creator - the students, they are the children of God; what an experienced student is to innovate in the future, all of it was received by Moshe. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 9:10), "and upon them, as all of the words," and they expounded in the second chapter of Megillah 19b, "[this] teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed to Moshe the inferences of the Torah and the inferences of the scribes (<i>dikdukei sofrim</i>)." And even though the inferences of the scribes were only by way of proofs - as I explained in the Introduction - it states, 'received,' since it is speaking about the majority [of what was revealed to him]. [This is] as was explained by Ramban in the Introduction to the commentary on the Torah about the fifty gates of understanding that were created in the world - that it states, 'created' about the majority. So does it appear to me. 
<b>and he passed it on to Yehoshua:</b> As everything that he received, he passed on to Yehoshua. But concerning Moshe, it cannot state that it was passed on to him, since [it was] not the whole Torah [which] was passed on to him. As, behold, the fiftieth gate [of wisdom] was not passed on to him, as they, of blessed memory, stated (Rosh Hashana 21b) on (Psalms 8:5), "and you have made him slightly less than the angels/God." And therefore it stated with him, that he received - meaning to say, that everything that was fitting for him to receive, he received at Sinai. Such have the commentators explained.  
<b>and the prophets passed it on to the men of the Great Assembly:</b> [Meaning] to say that even though not all of the Assembly were prophets, the entire Torah was passed on to them, as it was passed on to those who preceded them. But from here on - as the generations declined - not the entire thing was passed on. But [rather] everyone received it according to his ability. And nonetheless, the [portion of] the Torah that was in his hand was a transmission to him, [that had been passed on] one man from another [going back] to Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - from Sinai.
<b>the Great Assembly:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that they were called this since they restored the crown to its original splendor, etc... Yirmiyahu and Daniel came but did not say, “mighty and awesome:" Yirmiyahu said (Jeremiah 32:18), the Power, the great and mighty Lord of hosts is His name." Daniel said (Daniel 9:4),”the great and awesome" and did not say, "the mighty."
<b>They said three things:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained [that these are three things] that contain within them the preservation of the Torah. And in Mishna 10 of Chapter 2, he explains also that [these things] were accustomed to be in their mouths, like he explained, "He would say," below in Mishna 2.
<b>"stand up many students":</b> They [used] an expression of standing, since from the days of Moshe until the days of Rabban Gamliel, they would study while standing [as Rabbi Bartenura explained at the end of Sotah] and the teacher would sit on a chair (Megillah 21a) - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Yosef ibn Nachmias. And even though this is correct according to the language, nonetheless this is not the intended message - whether they should stand or sit. And why does it state, "and stand up?" It should have stated, "and teach," since this is the intended message. Hence it appears to me that it states, "and stand up many students," [meaning to say] to stand them up on their feet, that they should not slip. This is to say, to stand them up on their feet in understanding the truth of the Torah. As this is [something's] standing and preservation, as falsehood has 'no feet,' as in the way of the Psalmist (Psalms 73:2), "my feet were almost pushed away." And since it wanted to say, "many," therefore it was necessary to mention the standing - since, even though they were many, even with all that, the study should be in the manner that they will stand [and] be preserved upon the truth. As without this, it is not [considered] the standing up of students. But [rather] they would be gazing [and] laying down in a trance of foolishness. It comes out for us from these general words that we do not observe this ethic unless we teach the truth and that which is just, nothing else. And see what I will write, with the help of Heaven, in Mishna 6.

Mishnah 2

<b>”The world stands":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "The world was only created, etc." And about the mishnah at the end of our chapter, it is written in Midrash Shmuel, “There are books found,  that have the textual variant, 'the world was created.'”
<b>"On the Torah":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Had Israel not received Torah, the heavens and the earth would not have been created, as it is written (Jer. 33:25), “Were it not for my covenant, etc." And since it was difficult for him, as 'service and acts of kindness are [also a part  of] Torah, therefore he explained [Torah here] as its acceptence; and the explanation of the verse would be, “If not for my covenant” that you accepted, “night and day, also the laws of the heavens and the earth I would not have set.” And see similar to this at the end of Chapter 3 of Nedarim. And this is difficult to me, since if so, “on the Torah” which it stated is not a warning at all; and [so] it is not similar to the others. And hence it appears to me that the Torah [here] is [referring to] reason and Torah study. And this is [the understanding] of that which is written, “if not for my covenant (which is studied) night and day.” [This is] as the matter is stated (Yehoshua 1), “and you shall reason in it night and day." And in the commentary of Rashi, “for were it not, etc...” is not extant, but rather [just], “on the Torah, as it is stated, 'if not, etc...'” 
<b>"on the [Temple] service":</b>And they were not precise, as it is not the language of a mishnah nor a bereita, but [rather] the statement of <i>amoraim</i> (scholars form the later part of the Talmudic period.): Rabbi Yakov bar  Acha said that Rav Assi, etc. in Taanit 27b in Chapter 4. And one should be precise [about] the language of the statement, “If it were not for the groupings [involved in the sacrifices], the heavens and earth would not stand.” And if so, it is not a proof that it was because of them that they were created. As behold, it is possible to say that [only] after they were created, they would no longer exist if there were no groupings. But it is not that the groupings were a reason for their creation, [meaning] that they were created for their sake <i>ab initio</i>, as the power of that which preserves a thing that already exists is not as great as the power of that which creates a thing that was not [in existence]. And if so, from where in this statement do we get that the power of [the sacrificial] service is great enough that for its sake was the world put into existence and created. And I found about this statement, that it is also extant in the chapter [entitled] Bnei Ha'eer in the tractate Megillah 31a. And there, it is stated like this, “Rabbi Ami said, 'If it were not for the groupings, the heavens and earth would not stand, as it is stated,  “If not for my covenant night and day, also the laws of the heavens and the earth I would not have set” and it is written (Genesis 15:8), “And he said, 'Lord, God, in what way will I know that I will inherit it'” - said Avraham, our father, peace be upon him, “Master of the universe, maybe – God forbid - Israel will sin in front of you, etc.” He said to him, “Take a threefold calf, etc.”'” And he expounds [that], “My covenant” is referring to the covenant between the pieces [just cited] and it stated, “I would not have set.” We infer from this that the [sacrificial] service is a reason for the setting of the world and its creation. And if you will ask, let it be [the case] during the time that the Temple is in existence, but from since it was destroyed, what is there to say; one can answer that the world was created for the sake of His looking forward to the time that the Temple will exist. And also, that behold, it concluded the statement mentioned, “He said in front of Him, 'let it be [the case] when, etc.'” and He answers him, “I have already established the [written] order of the sacrifices: whenever they read about them, I count it for them as if they sacrificed a sacrifice in front of me.” And what is written in the commentary of Rashi on Taanit is confused – since from where did he [derive] to learn it [about this statement]?

Mishnah 3

<b>The man of Sokho:</b> He was the master of the place that was called Sokho. And "man" is an expression [which means] master, as we learn in a mishnah, "my man, [the] High Priest" in tractate Yoma 18. And there, Rabbi Bartenura explained in Mishna 3 of the first chapter, "'My man' is my master." [And see Mishnah Challah 4:10, s.v. the man of Tekoa, etc.]
<b>"Do not be as servants who are serving the master in order to receive a reward":</b> Rabbi Bartenura expalined, "but rather out of love alone." Meaning to say, that about this he [only] warned that the service be from love only, since it is the essence of service; and not that he meant to say that service on the condition of receiving a reward is forbidden, since [such a one] would be serving God nonetheless. And therefore the perfect Torah did not stop from making known the reward and punishment [that depends upon performance of the commandments]. But if one serves with the hope of reward or the prevention of hurt, behold, he is not on the same level as the one who serves from love, as [the latter] does not have any personal interest in his service at all. And the teacher [of this mishnah] wanted to warn us to be from those that serve from love, but not to exclude the one who serves with the hope of a reward from the category of those that serve [God], as this is not the case. [This is] as their statement in the first chapter of Bava Kamma 10b, "One who says, 'this coin is given to charity in order that my son should live; in order that I should have a share in the world to come' - behold, he is completely righteous." And also, if you do not say like this, you will - God forbid - cut off the feet of the 'haters of Israel' (a euphemism for the Jews), as where is the one who can weigh and where is the one who can count and say that he is someone who serves from love. Would it be good in the eyes of God that anyone who serves and has in mind that the Torah's stipulation - that was told to us from His mouth, may He be blessed - should materialize for him, not receive his goodly reward for this? It is not good for their Master that you should say like this. And so [too] did Rebbi say at the beginning of Chapter 2, "And weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it." And [it is] as I have written there, with Heaven's help. And so [too] in the end of the second chapter, "And the Master of your work is trustworthy, etc." And see over there what I will write about [the statement,] "and know the reception of their reward." And [the statement] of Azariah, brother of Shimon in Zevachim 1:2 proves [it]. And even [the teacher of our mishnah] did not intend this. And I say from his own words can you learn this and that he himself was careful about this, that we should not stumble from his words. As he said, "Do not be as servants, etc." and did not say, "Do not serve in order to receive a reward." And in this way he taught his students [this] in a quick fashion. Rather, he taught by saying, "Do not be like servants, etc;" meaning to say that certainly those that serve in order to receive a reward are [also] servants, but you should not be like them but greater than them and serve from love alone. And I saw from our master, our teacher, the rabbi, Rabbi Loewe from Prague, of blessed memory, in the book, Derekh Chaim that he wrote that therefore did [the teacher of our mishnah] state, "but rather be like servants, etc." and it was not enough for him to state, "Do not be, etc. Since from his statement, "Do not be," it would have sounded like he was negating and forbidding [one] from being "like servants that serve, etc.;" and this is not [correct], as this is not a prohibition, since even one who serves in this way is completely righteous. Rather, he is only coming to teach that there is a level and status still greater than this, and that is the one who serves from love. And hence he was compelled to repeat and say, "but rather be like, etc.;" [meaning] to say that the point of his intention is that you should be "like servants that serve their master not in order, etc," and that this is the greatest level. But he is not intending to say that it is forbidden to serve in order to receive a reward. These are his words and his opinion, of blessed memory. And from here, go and learn that behold this teacher, according to his completeness and his wisdom, was very wise in his words. Since  in the beginning of his words, he taught about this that one should not negate those that serve in order to receive a reward, but [rather] that also those that serve to be repaid to receive reward, he calls servants. And he also added an explanation, to explain: "but rather be, etc.," to say, "Are these not my words that I speak, that you should be [serving without the need for reward]. But not that I intended with my statement, 'do not be, etc.' to forbid. My main intention was just that 'you should be, etc.' to edify you to the most complete level of completion, and not to forbid the other as mentioned." And from here, all the more so should [the mishnah] not be understood according to the words of the teacher the mistake of Tsadok and Beitos, who said that he intended to say that there is no receiving of reward at all here, as is mentioned in the words of Rabbi Bartenura in his commentary on Mishnah 11. But he should have explained it explicitly, that it be explicit for all that hear [it]. (And I saw in Tosefot in the first chapter of Rosh Hashanah 4 at the top, who wrote that our Mishnah relates to gentiles who regret the earlier [good deeds]. To here [is what I saw]. And I wonder, how is it possible to say this, that the teacher chose his case about idol worshippers. And all the more so, since all of these words in Avot they were [constantly] accustomed to say, according to one opinion of Rabbi Bartenura above in Mishnah 2. And also our holy rabbi (Rebbi) should not have placed it in the Mishnah if his words were only about idol worshippers. And my mind was set at ease when I saw the words of [Tosefot] in the beginning of the first chapter of Pesachim 8b at the top, who wrote that [the mishnah] is speaking about a situation that if [a Jew] does not get the good that he was expecting, he wonders, and regrets the [act of] charity that he did, but one who does not wonder and regret, behold, he is completely righteous. And so [too] is it implied in the beginning of Rosh Hashanah and in the first chapter of Bava Batra. And according to this, that which they mentioned idol  worshippers in Rosh Hashanah was only an example, as they wonder [about good deeds when they are not rewarded for them], as it is found over there in the gemara. But our mishnah is about a Jew that wonders. And their words [that were puzzling me] are meant to say that our mishnah is like a case of idol worshippers, etc., [but] is [actually the case] of a Jew that wonders - who is like an idol worshiper who generally wonders.)
<b>"reward (<i>peras</i>)":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "It is what a person gives to someone who served him, when he is not legally obligated to give him anything," meaning to say that this is the distinction between a reward and payment. Since payment is what must legally be given. And so [too] did Rambam write. 
<b>"not in order to receive a reward":</b> And a different version of the text is, "in order not to receive a reward." And I did not understand this version, as it is not applicable to say that he should serve in order and on condition that He should not give him a reward. As it is implied from this that if He would give him a reward, he would not serve Him. And even though the author of Midrash Shmuel wrote - that according to the first version, "Even though he serves without distinction, and not in order, etc., nonetheless, [such a person] knows that in the end the reward will come, and behold he hopes for the reward. But [rather, he should] serve in order not to receive a reward: which is that he explicitly serves in order that he not receive a reward, but [rather] from complete love." Up to here [are his words] - he fixed the matter but not the language [of the alternate text]. And that which he responded to the text [extant] in the book - that behold, even though that he only serves out of love, he [still] knows that the reward will eventually come - I say that this is not the way of one who serves from love.  Since if this is so, there is no greater servant from [want] of reward than this. But one who [truly] serves from love is always coming short in [his] service in his [own] eyes.  And he thinks to himself that he has not served as is fitting to Him, due to his great love for Him, may He be blessed. And so did Hillel say, "And if I am for myself, what am I," as per the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah 14. And not only that, but not only does he not hope with the hope of reward, but he fears for his soul lest he has sinned in his shortcomings in his service and has been guilty. And that is how the teacher [of this Mishnah] ends and says, "and may the fear of Heaven be upon you," and as I will explain. And such was the attribute of the forefathers, since thus did Avraham, our father, peace be upon him - even though he was assured of [having] seed - say afterwards, "and I am going barren." And this is [also what is referred to as] the 'Dread of Yitschak.' And Yaakov was also afraid, lest he was dirtied by sin. This is the inheritance of the servants of God, who serve from love. 'And that which goes up in their heart will not be' a hope for reward at all. And therefore the [alternative] version of the book is the correct one. So does it appear to me. 
<b>"and may the fear of Heaven be upon you":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that "the one who serves out of fear is careful concerning negative commandments" and so [too] did  Rambam explain. And according to what I wrote above, [this statement] is itself a condition of the one who serves from love. And that which they called God, may He be blessed, with the name, "Heaven," is to say that this fear should not be be a fear of punishment, which is also a superficial service and it carries some personal interest. But [rather] the fear that they warned about is a fear (awe) of His greatness, may He be blessed. And this was taught by the name, "Heaven," since His  greatness and power are apparent there though the creatures of the heavens and all of their multitudes and their movements, without a doubt. So does it appear to me. 

Mishnah 4

<b>Yose ben Yoezer, man of Tsreida, etc.:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "All the Tannaim (early teachers), etc." as we learned in Mishnah Chagigah 2:2. And Tosefot explained there (Chagigah 16, s.v. Yose) in the name of the Yerushalmi that the first disagreement in Israel was in their days. And therefore I say that before them the pairs are not mentioned, as there was one leader in [each] generation and none second to him. Which is not the case from those days onwards, when the connection was separated and 'they became like two heads." And, nonetheless, all of their Torah was true, as behold they received it [transmitted by their predecessors]. And the disagreement was only in things that were dependent upon reasoning, to be expounded according to one of the mechanisms though which the Torah is expounded, as Rambam has spoken about at length concerning this in his introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah.
<b>they received from them:</b> Ramah explained  ["from them" to mean] from Shimon and Antigonos. And Rabbi Yosef ibn Nachmias wrote that they first learned in front of Shimon the Righteous and [then] he died, and they had not yet learned their fill and went back to learn in front of Antigonos - [who was] the replacement of Shimon the Righteous - until he also died. And they took his place. Up to here is [what is written] in Midrash Shmuel. And that which he wrote in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Lirma  that the people of their generation received [the transmission] from them, and that it is possible to explain each expression of receiving thus in this chapter does not [appear correct]. Even though there is a bit of a side [to explain] like this, since we did not learn explicitly, "they received from Shimon and Antigonos;" but, nonetheless, it does not appear [correct], since it is not fitting not to mention that they received and to mention that others received from them. And also because the main intention of letting know the transmission which the teacher made known was to teach the chain of transmission which is from Sinai, one man from another until this redactor. And from them it is that he redacted [the Mishnah]. And there are books that have the textual variant, "from him." And Midrash Shmuel wrote in the name of Rashbatz that it is a [more] exact version, if it is substantiated.
<b>"become dirty in the dust of their feet:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained in another explanation: "'That you should sit at their feet, etc.' For so were they accustomed, etc." And it is not difficult concerning that which was explained at the end of Sotah that until Rabban Gamliel died, they would learn Torah standing up, since here, this is what is meant: that if they were sitting, their custon was that the master sits on the bench and the students sit at his feet on the ground. And there also, it did not mean that it was forbidden for them to sit and that they would only learn while standing up. As it was only saying that there was vigor in the world and [so] they would learn standing up in honor of the Torah, but if sometimes something would occur that [would make] them sit - for example, they would be long in the study hall  - here it is saying that "they were accustomed, etc." And also (another possibility is that) it is like Rava (in Megillah 21) who answers the [seemingly contradictory] verses, "and he sat at the mountain" [and] "and I stood at the mountain" - the soft [easy] ones standing up, the difficult ones sitting down. It is [here] no better than [Rava's case of] Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - from the mouth of the Strength (God).
<b>"thirstily (<i>vatzama</i>):"</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Like a thirsty person, etc." And so [too] is the language of Rashi. And it appears to me that their textual variant was <i>ketzama</i> (like a thirsty one), with a [Hebrew letter] kaf. And in Midrash Shmuel in the name of R. Y. Ibn Nachmias, "In the six orders of Mishnah of the Yerushalmi, the textual variant is <i>ketzama</i>, with a kaf. And it all ends up to be one explanation - that you should drink their words like the desire of a thirsty one to drink water."  Up to here [are his words.]

Mishnah 5

<b>They so stated with his wife:</b> [These are] the words of Yose ben Yochanan; since his words that he said were accustomed to be in his mouth, but he received them from his teachers. [It is as] Rabbi Bartenura explained in the beginning of our chapter, that all of their words in this tractate are words of transmission [that extend back] to Sinai. And this is also [why] on [the later phrase,] "From this, the sages said, etc.," Rabbi Bartenura explains, "Our holy master wrote it, etc,." and he did not explain like this until here. And the author of Midrash Shmuel wrote, "'They so stated with his wife' - our holy master said it." And so too did he also write in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Ephraim. And [he also wrote] that, "'From this, the sages said' - sages that came after him added to his words." Up to here [are his words]. And so [too] have we found in the end of Sotah that they added after him in the Mishnah - after Rebbi died, etc. But with regards to this explanation, the expression, 'they said,' that was stated by the teacher is difficult to me. And if it was Rebbi that said such on the words of Yose, behold they are the words of an individual, and why did he say, "they said."
<b>all the more so with the wife of his friend:</b> Because of the suspicion [of adultery thereby created]. So did Rashi write. [This is] according to the second explanation that Rabbi Bartenura wrote about, "They so stated with his wife."
<b>"Any time that a man increases, etc. he causes evil to himself, etc.":</b> The language of Midrash Shmuel: "Any time" - whether when his wife is pure, whether when she is in the days of her impurity, it is not fitting to increase his speech with her. Since if she is menstruant and impure, the speech brings to desire and the desire brings to action. And you can have no greater evil than this, in that he causes evil to himself.  And if she is pure, it would have been better that this time that he sits idly in idle talk, he would [use] to be involved in words of Torah.  And that which it is written, "and neglects the words of Torah" is when he increases conversation with his wife [who is] pure. To here [are his words]. And this is what Rabbi Bartenura [meant when he] wrote, that, "from his words, it appears that it is [speaking about] even when his wife is pure." And Rashi ends, "because he neglects the words of Torah." Up to here [are his words]. And to my hands were brought mishnahs from the Land of Israel of the orders of Zeraim, Kodashim and Taharot. And among them was also this tractate and it was edited [to read], "Anyone who increases conversation, etc."

Mishnah 6

<b>"Acquire for yourself a friend:"</b> The words of Rabbi Bartenura: "And even if you need to acquire him for a large sum and to spend money upon him in order to acquire his love. But with a mentor, it is not relevant to say, 'Acquire for yourself a mentor,' as a [teacher of Torah] must teach for free." And he did not write these words of his with precision. As since he explained the friend (<i>chaver</i>) to be a <i>chaver</i> in an association of Torah study - as he ends, "but with a teacher, etc..., he needs to teach for free" - what is that which he said, "in order to acquire his love?" [According to what he wrote,] he should have said, "in order to acquire his association." But [rather] the beginning of his words are taken form the words of Rambam, and [Rambam] did not state them about an association of study. As this is what he wrote: "'and acquire for yourself a friend' - it mentioned it with an expression of acquisition, etc... as a man must acquire for himself a confidant so that his actions and all of his affairs be bettered, as they said (Taanit 23a), 'either a friend or death, etc.' And he needs to make efforts, etc... so that he brings him to his love, etc." To here are his words.  And in the Midrash Shmuel, [its author] wrote in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Lirma that he had difficulty as to why [Yehoshua ben Parachia] did not warn that one should get students. As, behold, they said (Taanit 7, Makkot 10), "Much have I learned from my teachers, etc... and from my students more than them all." And he gave a reason for this: that the entire endeavor of the students is to learn. Hence, they only learn in the place that their heart desires most or from whom it appears that they can learn from the most. And since he may not be able to find someone who will want to be his student, hence the teacher [of this mishnah] did not warn about them. To here are his words. And our teacher, our master, the teacher, Rabbi Lioeve (Maharal), of blessed memory, wrote in his book, Derekh Chaim, that he did not say, "acquire for yourself a student," as it is not fitting to do this thing; for a man to make himself into a mentor and to take for himself a reputation of importance, to say, "Learn from me," as they do in these lands. To here are his words. And even though their words are the truth and just, in my eyes it appears that the question is not a question from the beginning. As the teacher [of this mishnah] was already preceded by the precursors of his precursors, the men of the Great Assembly, since they said, "and stand up many students." And they were only speaking when the students wanted [to learn under a teacher] as it is impossible to force them. And they were not talking about someone who is unfit to stand up students, as behold, they said, "and stand up;" which means upon the foot of truth, as I explained over there with Heaven's help. And this can only be done by someone who has truth in his hand. And they were not speaking about the arrogant and self-aggrandizing who say, "I shall rule and be a head and a captain of people by the expansion of the academies of students," as all the words [of true teachers] are ethics and humble righteousness. But about the one who has the potential to stand up many students, about him did they say and warn that he should establish many students. [This is] by way of that which is stated (Proverbs 7:26), "and abundant are all of her kill" - this is [in reference] to the student that got to [the level] of judgement and doesn't issue judgement (Sotah 22a). But about the one who has not reached this level and is self-aggrandizing as mentioned, he too is included in (Proverbs 7:26) "many corpses has she fallen." And [this is known] by way of an a fortiori argument (<i>kal vechomer</i>) from the one who has not reached judgement and issues judgment, as that is temporary and at selected times and to a few individuals, whereas this is everyday and to many students - and "that which is mixed up, once it has gone up, it has gone up [and will not change]" - it is an a fortiori argument and a hyper-a fortiori argument that upon him it is said, "many corpses has she fallen" [just like it is said about the one that only issues judgement occasionally]. And it is not a question [to ask], "If so, why did they [not differentiate and] just say, "and stand up many students." Since about this and that which is similar to this, it has been stated (Hoshea 14:10), "and the righteous will walk in them and the wicked will stumble in them." And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote that a [Torah] teacher must teach for free is explicit in Nedarim 4:3. And even though one can take a wage with scripture, - as it is found there - the main warning of the teacher [of this mishnah] to make for oneself a teacher is about the study of the Mishnah and the Gemara - since scripture is 'a measure and not a measure' as is found at the end of the second chapter of Bava Metzia 33a.

Mishnah 7

<b>"Distance [yourself] from a bad neighbor":</b> It stated an expression of distancing with his neighbor, since a person is close to him. And with an evildoer who is not his neighbor, it was not forced to say, 'distance,' since he is not close. [Rather,] it only warned him not to befriend him. And it said about the neighbor, "bad," and about the one who is not a neighbor, "evildoer" - even though both of them are evildoers - since his being neighbors with an evildoer is bad for [the latter's] neighbor, and his proximity is very harmful. But the evil of an evildoer who is not near to a person does not cause that person any bad - even though he is an evildoer to the Heavens - unless he befriends him. So did he write in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious teacher, Rabbi Yosef Ibn Shoshan. And in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yehuda Lirma, he wrote that he was precise [about] why it said, "distance" (<i>harchek</i>) - which is from the causative [form] - and it did not say, "distance oneself" (<i>hitrachek</i>) - which is from the reflexive form. And he said [that the reason is] that if a person comes to live next to the bad neighbor because he doesn't know him, one should distance [this newcomer] and warn him not to dwell [near] him. Up to here [are his words.] And in my eyes it appears that in both of the [cases here], the teacher adopted the language of scripture. With distancing, as it is stated (Proverbs 5:8), "Distance from upon her your path;" and you do not find <i>mitrachek</i> as a causative expression in all of scripture. And with befriending, as it is stated (II Chronicles 20:37), "With your making friends with Achaziyahu the Lord breached your acts." And that is as [the mishnah] ends, "and do not despair of punishment," which it  as it is in this verse [where the punishment comes at the end]. 
<b>"and do not despair of punishment":</b> And it does not say that he should worry about punishment, since such a thing is a bad trait - the one who worries about punishment; but [rather], "do not despair of punishment." Which is what Haman did when he relied upon his great wealth, and in the blink of an eye, his success reversed itself upon him. And this is [the meaning] of the expression, 'do not despair' - Derekh Chaim. 

Mishnah 8

"<b>Do not make yourself like the judges' advisers":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains, "Like those people that set up and arrange the claims of a litigant before the judges. As it is forbidden for a person to reveal the judgment to one of the litigants and to say to him, 'Do the following, etc.'" And even though the beginning of his words appear that he is explaining 'judges' advisers' [to mean] that they themselves arrange [the claims] like this in front of the judges - and that is how Rashi explained in the last chapter of Sotah 47b, "The ones that whisper secrets, whisper to the judges to open up a path to the merit of this one or of the guilt of the other one." Up to here [are his words]; and like the explanation of Rashi in the fourth chapter of Ketuvot 52 - but from the end of his words, you learn that also the beginning of his words are that they are arranging and setting up the claims of the litigants [who will come] in front of the judges. [And] not that they themselves give reasons in front of the judges, but rather that by their revealing [them] to the litigant - by saying to him, "Do this;" behold, it is as if they are making claims in front of the judges. And so [too] did Rashi explain here [and] also in Chapter 20 of Shabbat 139. And these are the words of Rambam: "Judges' advisers are individuals that teach claims and laws until people become expert in their cases, such that they compose questions, that when the judge says like this, your answer should be thus - as if  they were setting up the case and the litigants in front of them. And for this are they called 'judges' advisers' - it is as if they set up the cases in front of them." Up to here [are his words.] And according to this the word, 'advisers,' implies [the] two words, '[of] the cases before,' and is not relating to the word, 'judges' alone. And in the book, Lev Avot, [its author] writes that he heard that thus is its explanation: that he is like a judges' adviser himself, since the judgment that the judges decide to render this one innocent is on account of that which he ordered [the litigant's] claims - and, if so, this one advised the judges to make this judgment. Up to here [are his words.] And in Midrash Shmuel, [the author] writes in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Matatyah Hayitzhari and these are his words: "It should not enter your mind, that he will make as a claim for the litigant words of iniquity and trickery, as such ones are complete evildoers, but [rather] even [when he uses] words of truth and the case changes on account of what he does. [It is] like that [case] in the chapter [entitled] Naara Shenitpateta (Ketuvot 52b) in the case of [the payment for] healing [a man's widow] that has no limits [and so] is like sustenance (<i>mezonot</i>) and is payed from the estate of the husband, [wherein] Rabbi Yochanan advised them, "Set a fixed amount [with a physician] for the healing so that it will be something that has a limit [and no longer considered like sustenance]." Up to here [are his words]. And from this came out for me an explanation of the words of Rabbi Bartenura who wrote, "and to say to him, 'Do the following.'" And [ostensibly] he should have said, "You should claim the following," like the words of Rambam. But rather my opinion is that [he is only speaking about] bringing up advice for [the litigant] to do an act like that [case] of Rabbi Yochanan and so also with Rabbi Nachman in the chapter [entitled] Hakotev (Ketuvot 86a) [wherein] he brought up advice to [bring about] the relinquishment of a marriage contract. But it is possible that according to Rabbi Bartenura one need not be pious and refrain from teaching him to order his words and his claims, so long as there is no falsehood in it. But certainly for Rambam it is not the case, but rather even the ordering of words more generally is also forbidden. And these are the words of the teacher, Rabbi Yonah which are brought in Midrash Shmuel: "It is not speaking here about one who teaches false claims to his friend, since a man like that is completely wicked and this is a big sin - and [in this tractate] we are dealing with words of piety. Rather [it is speaking] about one who orders the claims that are in his mouth and finds reasons for them, and he sets it up in front of the judges and reveals the judgement to him. And he says that it is not fitting to do so, as they will suspect him." Up to here [are his words]. And from the words of them all we have learned that this is why the teacher said, "like judges' advisers" with a [Hebrew letter] kaf [which as a prefix means, 'like']. Since if he had said, "Do not make yourself a judges' adviser, it would have been implied that the setting up [of legal cases] is forbidden by law and this is not [true]. And it also appears to me by being precise that [the reason] the teacher said, "yourself" and did not teach it with brevity - "do not be, etc." - is because of [the case] of Rabbi Yochanan.  As we say in the gemara, that this is why he gave advice - since he was a relative and reasoned [that it was a case of] 'from your flesh, do not turn away.' And afterward, he had regret and said, "We have made ourselves like the judges' advisers," since he reasoned that it is different with an important person. And we infer from here that if he was not an important person, what he did would have been fine because of 'from your flesh, do not turn away.' And that is [the reason for] what the teacher said, "Do not make yourself;" which is to say according to yourself, since you are an important person - do not make [your self] like the advisers, but besides that it is certainly permissible. And according to that, even not for his relative is it permissible when he is not an important person. And that which Rabbi Yochanan said, "'From your flesh, do not turn away,'" is [because] if it were not for that, why should he do this to make one lose against the other, as 'what did he see that made the blood of this one redder.' And so [too], the warning of the teacher [of this mishnah] is only for an important person, since he was precise to teach, "yourself." But when he is not an important person, there is not even piety [in abstaining from helping a litigant] as he is not teaching him to claim falsehoods. However we have learned from Rabbi Yochanan, who said, "Because of 'from your flesh, do not turn away,'" that if [it was] not thus, he would have turned away, and not from the angle of piety but rather what is it to him to advantage one and make the other lose. But if he is his relative and [the one giving the legal aid] is not an important person,  [the latter] should [do so] and also fulfill, 'from your flesh, do not turn away.' So does it appear in my eyes. (But from the language of Rashi - "An important person is different, as [people] learn from him and there will be those that will do [this] even not for relatives;" to here [are his words] - if so, anyone who [does this] not for relatives is included in the warning of "do not make, etc.")  
<b>"they should be like evildoers in your eyes":</b> But not [that] both of them be like righteous ones. As, if so, he will not search out their claims and he will judge each one as meritorious and not get down to the truth of the case. But when both of them are like evildoers in his eyes, he will search out the claims of each one and the trickery of each one and - because of that - he will get down to the truth of the case. It can also be said that since, at the very least, one of the litigants is going against the law, and so [too] the second litigant that has a case against him, he is [also] like [the first] - as they said like this concerning an oath (Shevuot 39a): "Those that stand there say one to another, 'please remove yourselves from upon the tents of these wicked people, etc.'" And they said there (39b and 47b), "'An oath of the Lord shall be between them' - [this] teaches that the oath rests upon both of them." And all of this is because since this one has a case with him, they are both called evildoers until they accept the judgement. And then, they are both righteous, as acceptance of the judgement after the disagreement that they had between them is on account of the righteousness that is within them - Derekh Chaim. <b>"when they received the judgment:"</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "Such that you should not suspect, etc." As I would have thought, "Since there is [a reason] to suspect [here], this one is not included in, 'and judge every person as meritorious.'" [Hence,] it is necessary [to write this in the Mishnah]. 

Mishnah 9

<b>"But be careful with your words, lest from them they learn":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained [that "they"] is the litigant or the witnesses. And even though, in the first part [of this mishnah], we only taught, "witnesses," nonetheless, go after the reason - "lest, etc." - which is certainly also applicable to the litigant. And also as, "but (and) be careful, etc." is a matter on its own. And therefore, when it said, "they learn," it was said about all who can learn. And [so] all implies the witnesses and the litigants. 

Mishnah 10

<b>Shamaya and Avtalyon:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "They were righteous converts." And so [too] did Rambam write in his introduction to his essay, Mishneh Torah. And it is implied that they themselves were righteous converts, but it is not plausible. Since they were the nassi and the head of the court as Rabbi Bartenura explained in Mishnah 4, and a convert is not fit to judge, as Rabbi Bartenura has explained in Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:2 (and all the more so to be the head of the court, as we have learned in Mishnah Horayot 1:4). And this is the language of our Rabbi Lioeve (Maharal) in the book, Derekh Chaim, "Shamaya and Avtalyon said that they were from the congregation of converts. And so is it attested in Gittin 57b and Yoma 71b. But the explanation is not that they themselves were converts - since, if so, how is it possible to appoint them as nassi and head of the court? Rather, they [were only descended] from converts but their mother was certainly Jewish, and therefore they were permissible to appoint as nassi and head of the court. But there are those that explained that they themselves were converts - certainly this is a complete mistake." Up to here [are his words.]
<b>"Love work":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "Even if he has from what to sustain himself, etc." - since now he is not doing work for its reward but for its own love, and that is [what is meant by] that which it said, "Love [work]", and it did not say, "Do work." And Rabbi Bartenura wrote that idleness leads to distraction. This is what Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said in Mishnah Ketuvot 5:5 (Page 59a). And I am surprised, since over there (Ketuvot 61b), the law is decided like Rabbi Eliezer, that idleness leads to promiscuity. And the practical difference between [the two positions] is one who plays (gambles): Since [if the obligation is] because of distraction, it is not [an issue if he is occupied by playing], but [if it is] because of promiscuity, it is [an issue] as was explained by Rabbi Bartenura there. And it is possible to say that only with a woman does licentiousness apply, as women are weak willed when it comes to being seduced. And so do you find in the Chapter ahead, Mishna 7, "The more maidservants, the more licentiousness;" but with the increase of servants, we learn, "the more theft." 
<b>"hate lordship":</b> And Rabbi Bartenura explained in the [second] explanation, "As lordship buries those that have it." As the Master said in the first chapter of Sotah 13 and Berakhot 55a, "Why did Yosef die [before his brothers]? Because he conducted himself with lordship." (And he should distance himself with the force of hatred, the opposite of loving work, according to the commentary of Tosafot Yom Tov. So does it appear to me - Ed.)
<b>"and do not become familiar with the government":</b>Rabbi Bartenura explained, "In order to receive lordship through it." And Rashi ends, "Since they only bring a person close for their own need." And, if so, this is [the same as] Mishna 3 in the following chapter, and see there. 

Mishnah 11

<b>"Sages, be careful with your words":</b> That which he warned the Sages, was not [with] the intention that other people are not warned about this; but rather if a doubt arises about the words of the Sages, the listeners will come to a general mistake, which is not the case with the words of a commoner, to whose words we are not attentive. Therefore, he warned the Sages more - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan.
<b>"a place of evil waters":</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "That show sides of the Torah that are not like the law (<i>halakha</i>), and this is a term for 'evil waters.'" And the language is cut up (inverted), since evil waters is a term for sides of the Torah that are not like the law. And the language of Rambam: "Evil waters is a term for heresy."
<b>"and the students who follow after you will drink":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "As happened to Antigonos, the man of Socho, with  Tsadok and Beitos, etc... and they and their students became heretics." And similar to this did he write, in the last chapter of Mishnah Yadayim 4:6, "Groups of Jews gathered with them, etc." And this is not exactly the same as the words of the teacher, who is only teaching because of "the students that come after you." And I found in the commentary of Rashbam [on the] chapter [entitled], Yesh Nochalin (Bava Batra 115a), who wrote in the name of Avot DeRabbi Natan a story of Tsadok and Beitos who were teaching their students the words of Antigonos, "Do not be like servants, etc." and the students erred, etc. And so [too] did I see in Avot DeRabbi Natan, Chapter 5.

Mishnah 12

<b>"Pursuing peace":</b> As the matter is stated (Psalms 34:15), "seek peace and pursue it."
<b>"loving the creatures":</b> Because they are the creatures of the Holy One, blessed be He, therefore it is fitting that you should love them. And [it is] also [fitting] that the love should be from this side and not from any other side - for example, because of the benefit that comes to you from them. And close to this [is the explanation] in Midrash Shmuel.
<b>"bringing them closer to Torah":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that when Aharon would know about someone that he committed a sin, he would befriend him, etc. And it is a little difficult, as this appears to contradict the statement of Nitai of Arbel who said, "Do not befriend an evildoer." And I saw in Chapter 12 of Avot DeRabbi Natan, "What does the verse (Malachi 2) teach , 'and he brought back many from sinning?' When Aharon was walking on the way; if he ran into an evil man, he would greet him. On the morrow, that man would want to commit a sin, [but] he would say, 'woe is me, how can I lift (my eyes afterwards) and see Aharon - I would be embarrassed from him, since he greeted me. It comes out that that person would prevent himself from a sin." To here [are its words]. And so [too] did Rambam write, "He would greet him first and he would become beloved to him and he would increase his talking with him. And that man would be embarrassed inside, etc."

Mishnah 13

<b>"Spread (<i>Negad</i>) a name, lose his name":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "He who extends his name, etc." And so [too] did Rambam explain. And in Derekh Chaim, he is precise about the change in language, as from the beginning, he teaches, "a name," and afterwards, "his name." And he explains that this is what he is saying: <i>Negad shema</i> - meaning to say, the name of dominion, <i>nagid</i> (noble). And this indicates spreading, but it is not fitting; rather [it is better] to lose the name of one having dominion, since lordship buries, etc. And there are those that have the textual variant, "Spread a name, lose a name," with a [Hebrew letter,] alef. And in Midrash Shmuel, "'Spread a name' - one who spreads his name to make for himself a name, like the name of the great ones, loses his name, that he had before. And he ends up 'bald' (lacking a name) from this and from that." And in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan, he wrote that the correct version is both of [the times, 'name' is spelled] with [the Hebrew letters,] shin, mem, alef. And about that which he stated it in the language of translation (Aramaic), see the end of our tractate. 
<b>"and one who does not add, ceases":</b> And Kessef Mishneh in Chapter 3 of the Laws of Torah Study (Mishneh Torah) explained, "That since he says, 'spread a name' - meaning to say, one who learns in order to enhance his name (fame) - [will] 'lose his name;' lest you say in your heart, 'I will no longer learn - as maybe my learning will be for my name, and it will be lost, etc.' To this he said, 'and one who does not add, will cease' certainly - as one who learns and stops is more difficult than everything. And concerning the one who [even] before he learned, says that he will not learn - to this, he says, 'he is liable to die.' And this is not [as bad as] 'cease,' since here he is [only] obligated in the death penalty, but if he has a merit, it suspends it for him." To here are his words. And this is not like the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura, who explains that "one that does not learn" is worse than "one who does not add." 
<b>"and one uses the crown":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains, "The crown of Torah." And that which [the Mishanh] stated plain, 'crown,' and did not explain, 'of the Torah' is because all of the crowns besides it are nothing - Midrash Shmuel in the name of R. Y. Ibn Shoshan. 

Mishnah 14



Mishnah 15

<b>(”Make your Torah fixed”:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "Such that you are not strict, etc." And this is not like the opinion of House of the father of Rabban Gamliel, who was from the House of Hillel, as per later. Since behold, they were strict, etc., as we have learned in Chapter 2 of Beitzah and Mishnah Eduyot 3:11.)
<b>"and receive, etc.":</b> See the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura in Mishnah Avot 3:12 and what I wrote there.

Mishnah 16

<b>Rabban Gamliel said:</b> And he was the grandson of Hillel, as we said in the first chapter of Shabbat 15, “Hillel and Shimon Gamliel and Shimon were the leaders during the time of the [Temple] for a hundred years.” And the commentators explained that for this reason was there no expression of receiving written from here on – since disagreement increased in Israel from the time of the students of Shammai and Hillel. And the Torah became like two Torahs, hence it is not applicable to say, 'receiving' with them, as the Torah of each and every sage was not defined and received and transmitted as it was with the earlier ones. But to me it appears that if it was for this [reason], the teacher would not have refrained from teaching that they received. As behold, they did receive the main parts of the Torah and there is no disagreement in it in any way, as Rambam explained in detail in his introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah. But there is no difficulty to begin with, as in Chapter 2, Mishnah 8, we learned, “Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai received from Hillel and Shammai, etc."
<b>"and do not frequently tithe by estimation":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained “the one who separates, etc... if he adds, etc... his tithes are disarrayed” since untithed produce is mixed in with them. Rambam, Laws of Tithes, Chapter 1. And so [too] did Rashi write in the second chapter of Kiddushin 52. And in the fourth chapter of Eruvin 9, he concludes, “which is not the case with priestly tithes (<i>terumot</i>), which has no measure. And see the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah Terumot 4:6. And in Midrash Shmuel, it is written in the name of the pious Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan and these are his words: "It is a wonder in my eyes why he did not completely forbid to tithe except by measuring. And let it say, 'Do not tithe by estimation.' What is [meant by] 'do not frequently (literally, increase)?' And therefore I say that the intention is that  even if you intend to increase the tithes and to give more than the measure [it it forbidden], lest you err in your estimate." And Tosefot in Gittin 31 (in the third chapter) agrees that they did not forbid it except when one has the intention to increase and increases [tithes] on purpose. [They learn this] from that which we learn in Mishnah Terumot 4:6, "More praiseworthy then all three of them" - it is implied that there are three [legal] possibilities [even though only two are explicitly mentioned, such that the third possibility implied in the mishnah] is estimation. And so [too] did Rabbi Bartenura explain there. We learn from this that even according to the Sages, estimation is not forbidden - and that is when he doesn't intend to increase [the tithe beyond its measure]. And nonetheless, according to Rambam that I [cited] there it is forbidden [even] without intention. And so [too] are the words of Rash there. And our teacher in Derekh Chaim explains that our mishnah is like Abba Eliezer ben Gomel - who Rabbi Bartenura mentions in the Mishnah Demai 5:2 – who holds that even the priestly tithe from the tithe  (<i>terumat maaser</i>), that has a measurement, is taken by estimation; and certainly with tithes also does he hold like this. And so [too] is it found in the gemara in Bekhorot 59, and it is as is written in the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah 7 in the last chapter of Bekhorot. And that is why he says "do not frequently," [meaning] even though the Torah permits you to tithe by estimation, nonetheless, do not do it frequently in order to avoid a doubt. To here are his words. And it is not difficult [such that one could ask], "What is different about [the main tithe as opposed to other types of tithes] that the mishna [specifically mentions] tithes." Since 'tithes' is a general name for all of the gifts that are from the [produce] of the land, as I have written is the language of the Yerushalmi Ma'asrot 4:2. And see the beginning of Mishnah Demai 4. But I saw in the commentary of Rash on Mishnah Terumot 1:7, who wrote that it appears that Abba Eliezer ben Gomel does not reason like that [which is written], "Do not frequently, etc." And so [too] did the Tosefot in Gittin and Bekhorot mentioned above write. 

Mishnah 17

<b>Shimon, his son:</b> And he was from the matyrs of the [Roman] government (<i>harugei hamalkhut</i>). And at the end of the first chapter of Keritot 8a, we learned, "Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, 'By this sanctuary, I will not sleep until it will be [sold] for a dinar.'" And perforce, this Rabban Shimon is not the one mentioned later at the end of our chapter, since [the latter] was not [a teacher] in the days of the Temple, since they only mentioned up until the second Shimon in the first chapter of Shabbat 76. And maybe when he spoke out this statement, he had not yet risen to the greatness of the title, 'Rabban' - similar to Ben Zakkai in Mishnah Sanhedrin 5:2. And even though I saw another reason about this in the book, Ten Essays, I have written what appears [correct] to me. 
<b>"better than silence":</b> And that is the textual version in the book, Midrash Shmuel. And in some books, they have the variant, "except silence." And so [it is] in the book, Derekh Chaim.
<b>"and it is not the study, etc.":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And you should know, etc." Since if it did not come as a proof about the above, it would have been fitting that this would have been preceded by "and whoever increases words, etc.," as that would [otherwise] be more fitting to put next to "and I did not find anything better for the body than silence."

Mishnah 18

<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel:</b> He is the grandson of Shimon who is mentioned in the previous mishnah. And this is the father of Rebbi, who is [known as] our holy rabbi, and with him does the second chapter begin.
<b>"the world stands":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[Meaning] the settlement of people is preserved." And this explanation works well, so that you do not query that which we learned in Mishnah 2, [that] there are three other things upon which the world stands. And even though Rabbi Bartenura explained there that it is about the creation of the world - that the world was created for their sake - nonetheless, there would also not be a need for the preservation of the world, without these three. That since they were the cause that the world be created when it was not, all the more so would they be a reason that it exist once it was created. As what was not [in existence, came to existence] for their sake - all the more so, what was [in existence, should exist] for their sake. Hence, Rabbi Bartenura explained that those [items mentioned] here are spoken about the settlement of people and not about the reason for the existence of the world generally. As behold, Torah, service and acts of lovingkindness can exist with people even though they are not settled together properly, [the latter] as a result of there not being, judgment, truth and peace. As there would be God's remnants - the precious few - through which the three pillars of the Mishnah of Shimon the Righteous would be preserved. And do not wonder [about the fact] that they said (Berakhot 17), "The world was only created for the sake of Chanina, My son." And they also said (Ibid., 6b), "The world was only created to command this one," about the verse, "This is all of man." And see what I wrote at the end of Mishnah Sotah 3:4.
<b>"the world stands":</b> And a textual variant is, "exists." And in Derekh Chaim, he wrote that it is the correct version.
<b>"as it is said (Zachariah 8:16), 'Judge truth and the justice of peace in your gates'":</b> It is in Zachariah 8:16.  And above it is written, "When I contemplated to do bad to you, etc... so I repented, contemplated in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Yehuda; do not fear. These are the things that you shall do, etc." And in the explanation of Rashi, [he wrote,] "judge in your gates" and he placed next to it, "maybe the Lord of Hosts will grace." Up to here [are his words]. And so [too] was written in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbam. And 'this one did not approach that one,' as "maybe [He] will grace" is in Amos 5:15 - it is stated, "Hate evil and love good and establish justice at the gate, maybe [He] will grace, etc." And also in Rashi's explanation and in the Mishnah of Tiberias, the verse is not [in the text of the mishnah].

Perek 2



Mishnah 1

<b>"Which is the straight path that a person should choose for himself, etc. And be as careful, etc.":</b> Because "the straight path that a person should choose for himself, etc." is an optional matter and it is good advice that it is teaching us, but he is not obligating a person with this. However, "and be as careful, etc." is obligating a person that he should be careful, etc. Therefore the beginning of the words of his mouth, "Which is the... path that a person should choose, etc." are in third person; and afterwards, "and be as careful" is in second person, in order to obligate him in this - Derekh Chaim. And see what I have written on Mishnah 9. And it mentioned [the word,] path (<i>derekh</i>) in the feminine, and see about that the beginning of tractate Kiddushin.
<b>"And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one":</b> Concerning the matter of carefulness - to be careful and quick with a light commandment as he is careful and quick with a weighty commandment - is what he is speaking about and warning, "for you do not know, etc." And it is not that he wants to say that when two commandments come to your hand, [and] one is light and one is weighty and you do not have the ability to do both of them together, that you should not let go of the light one and do the weighty one - as the mind would not tolerate that. But rather he is only speaking concerning the matter of carefulness and each one [is to be done] at its time. So explained Rabbi Y. Abarbanel and Derekh Chaim.  
<b>"for you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "The reward of one who performs a positive commandment is not explained in the Torah, etc." And this is the language of Rambam: The reward of positive commandments was not explained as to what each one is with God, may He blessed, etc. And leave that it is found, "so that your days will be multiplied, etc.;" "so that it will be good for you, etc.;" "so that your days will be lengthened." But in Derekh Chaim, he explained that that which he said here, that "you do not know the reward, etc.;" it is with regards to the exertion and care, and also the expense which is included in the exertion, about which he said that you don't know; as 'according to the toil is the reward.' But as far as the commandment itself, behold it is stated, "so that it will be good for you, etc.;" And he made a precise inference from that which we learned at the end of the chapter [entitled] Tolin concerning the sending away of [a mother bird from] the nest, "And if [this is the case] with a light commandment, etc, all the more so (a fortiori) is it with a weighty commandment." And what is the fortiori argument if you do not know the reward given for them. But rather it is referring to the matter of exertion and expense that you do not know. And about this, it says "a fortiori, etc." And he also wrote that that which we learned in the beginning of Peah, "These are the things for which a man eats the fruits in this world and the principal remains for the world to come: honoring father and mother, etc.," does not contain within it information about the reward given quantitatively but rather qualitatively, [saying that] for these one receives [reward] in this [world] and the next. But [about] the measure and the size, we still need to be informed. As you do not know - maybe there is another commandment, the size of the reward for which in the world to come is so great, that it outweighs the fruit and the principal of [the reward for] these commandments. Since, 'greater is one hour of pleasure in the world to come than all of life in this world.' And that which it says over there, "and Torah study is equal to them all," is not at all relevant to "you do not know the reward given for the commandments," which is only stated about commandments. But concerning Torah study [in comparison to] a commandment, they did not speak; as it is obvious that the reward for Torah study is greater. To here are his words. 
<b>"the reward given":</b> 'There is reward for your action' from God, may He be blessed. And behold, it is 'a bit similar to the kingdom on earth;' about which you will find that one who works for the king and has the reward for his work allotted, you will see that he will receive  much more reward from the king than that which is proper and allotted - as such is pleasing to the king. Or [it is called reward given] from this angle: reward like this is not fitting to completely be called reward, as behold, it is not the fitting reward [but greater than it]. But this is its name - it is called, "reward given;" as with it comes a great gift. And it is also not completely a gift, as behold, its reward is with it. And also [the reason] that we learn, "reward given" is that in proportion to the pleasure that [occurs] in front of Him by the doing of the commandment, the gift of the man grows - according to His will, may He be blessed. And this is the matter of the verse itself that states (Isaiah 40:10), "behold, His reward is with Him and His action is before Him." Since this is what it says, "behold, His reward is with Him" - the word, "behold," indicates something clear and known; as it is clear and known that His reward is with Him. And also, secondly, that "His action is before Him;" as in truth, the action is in front of Him, may He be blessed - and from this aspect, his reward is doubled and quadrupled as a great gift, as was said. So does it appear to me.   
<b>"Also, weigh the loss [that may be sustained through the fulfillment] of a commandment against the reward [that may be obtained] for [fulfilling] it, etc.":</b> As even though how much the reward will be is not known, we know that 'there is no reward for a commandment in this world' and that the true reward is in the world to come; and there is no comparison to it from the physical good that he will lose. 
As they expounded (Berakhot 34) about (Isaiah 64:3), "an eye has not seen." And like their statement, "one hour of pleasure, etc." And Rabbi is not coming to disagree about this with Antigonos. Rather, he said that when that scoundrel should run into you - he is Satan, he is the evil impluse - then is it fitting to caluculate the cost and benefit, so that you can remove him from upon you - Rabbi Y. Abarbanel, and so [too] is it written in Derekh Chaim. And according to that which I have written there in the mishnah of Antigonos - that he did not come to negate and to exclude the one who serves [God] for a reward from the category of servants of God, and he only said that the choicest service that has nothing above it is the one who serves not in order to get a reward - if so, the words of Rabbi are meant as a general rule and about the majority and Antigonos is speaking about the [select] individual. And would it only be that there would 'not be any in the general category that is not [like that] individual.'
<b>"Know":</b> As this 'keeping your eye' is not a physical vision, but rather with the vision of the mind. Therefore, he repeated and said, "know." And see the beginning of Chapter 3. 
<b>"what is above you (<i>mimekha</i>)":</b> Since if a weak one was above and a strong one below, the fear of the weak one would be on the strong one. All the more so, if the strong one were above. And <i>mimekha</i> (literally from you) means not far but right above from you. As the matter that is stated (Psalms 16:8), "I have placed the Lord in front of me." 
<b>"An Eye that sees, and an Ear that hears, and all your deeds are written in a book":</b> There are things that are perceived by vision, like the deed of the evildoer; and there are things that are perceived by hearing, like the word of one of the scoundrels - and hence, he says, "An Eye that sees, and an Ear that hears." And so that you will not say, "there is forgetting in front of His Throne of Glory," hence it said, "and all your deeds are written in a book." This is the book of memories (<i>sefer hazikhronot</i>) that the lyricist mentioned in the liturgical poem of the High Holidays. And also in the Torah, it is stated, "from Your book that You have written;" "I will erase him from My book." And it would have been enough to prevent transgressions if he were to keep his eye on and know that his actions are written in a book, and this is only so that the reward of his actions be paid to him. But he would not know and understand this without first knowing that there is a Seer and a Listener. Therefore he had to begin also with these two. And in Derekh Chaim [its author] wrote, "He said Eye and Ear in the singular, because He is not a person that has eyes of flesh and blood, God forbid."  

Mishnah 2

<b>The son of Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi:</b> [The latter] is  Rabbi who is at the beginning of the chapter. 
<b>"Excellent is the study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation":</b> In Derekh Chaim, he explained that it is because a worldly occupation is earlier in time than Torah study - it is for that reason that Torah study is made secondary to a worldly occupation by the word "with." To here [are his words]. And I found in Rash who explained in Mishnah Tahorot 7:4 that it is like (Ecclesiastes 9:9), "Enjoy life with the woman;" wherein life is primary. And here too, Torah is primary.
<b>"And all who work for the community":</b> It appears that according to the [second] explanation of Rabbi Bartenura, that [it means that] they force the community, etc., that they should do it for the sake of Heaven; that he means to say, do not concern yourselves that the community not be able to carry this heavy burden, as the merit of their ancestors will sustain them, etc., and even if it is much money. And so long as this matter that they are forcing them, etc. is for the sake of Heaven and not for any other interest in the world. And it also appears to me that it can be explained that "as the merit of their ancestors, etc." refers to what is after it, "And as for you, I credit, etc." and this is what it means to  say: You should work and [it should be] for the sake of Heaven when you force the community [to give money] for charity and for the redeeming of captives, and "I will credit you, etc.; since behold it is the merit of the ancestors that sustains the community to give and, nonetheless, the charity (<i>tsedekah</i>) of the community that they gave "will endure forever" - so too, [with] you, even though you did not give, but rather you coerced  and forced the community, also "as for you, I credit, etc.;" just as the charity of the community endures forever, even though it is the merit of their ancestors that is sustaining them. And thus it comes out well that it did not teach [this] in third person, as it began, "And all who work, etc." [in third person]. And also had it done so, with a shorter expression, "And I credit them, etc.," it would have been understood to also be referring to the community, as [it was] with "and their righteousness  (<i>tsidkatam</i>), etc." And with the other explanation [of Rabbi Bartenura], it can be explained that that which it said, "And as for you, etc." is like it is explained in Derekh Chaim: that were it not for this, it would have been understood that it was referring back to the ancestors that it mentioned. 
<b>"I credit them":</b> This [type of expression] is found in the language of the sages, as in "And I and Akiva ben Yosef are guarantors in the matter." And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote that it is explained that it is meaning the Holy One, blessed be He, saying "I" as it mentioned Him [when it stated] "for the sake of Heaven." To here [are his words]. And it is forced.
<b>"great reward":</b> The language of Derekh Chaim: In some books, our textual variant is "great reward." And its explanation is that a great (much) reward will be given to you, since you are involved with the needs of the community, which are many. And since they are many, you have much reward, as if you had [taken care] of many. To here [are his words].

Mishnah 3

<b>"Be careful about the authorities":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "Even though you need to be acquainted with the authorities to supervise, etc." Since Shamaya (in the previous chapter, Mishnah 10), was not speaking about [things] like this. As this is a great commandment to become acquainted with them in order to supervise communal matters and Mordechai and our holy rabbi (Rabbi) prove [it] - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbats. 

Mishnah 4

<b>"Make His [God's] will like your will":</b> This is the textual variant found in the books. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote in the name of Rabbi Y. Ibn Nachmias that in [a version of the] Mishnah from Jerusalem, the text is "with your will" with a [letter] <i>bet</i> [in the place of a <i>kaf</i>]. And the intention is that you should not do the commandment like someone who is boiling with anger and rage and [with] a sad heart, but rather with desire and a happy heart, so that He also do your will with His will. As sometimes, the Holy One, blessed be He, will do the will of a man with anger and rage to punish him in the end - as the matter [is stated], "to wipe them out forever and ever," and to destroy them. But when He does it with His will, [that man's] end will prosper greatly.
<b>"nullify your will, etc.":</b> It appears to me that "Make (your) [His] will, etc.," he said regrading positive commandments; and therefore, he said, "nullify your will, etc.," corresponding to negative commandments. 
<b>Hillel says, etc.:</b> I saw 'a holy one speak' - our master, the teacher, Rabbi Menachem Azariah in his book, Ten Essays, [in the] Essay [entitled] Chakor Din, Part II, Chapter 19, [writes] that this Hillel is the grandson of Rabbi, [and is the one] who bathed in Kabul with Yehuda, his brother (Pesachim 51a in the chapter [entitled] Makom Shenahagu); and here Rabbi taught about himself (Isaiah 59:21), "they will not go away from your mouth and from the mouth of your seed and the mouth of the seed of your seed." And afterwards, he placed adjacent to this Hillel (the grandson of Rabbi), the words of Hillel the Elder, the father of the lineage, who said, "A boor cannot fear sin." And the [arrangers of the Mishnah] were not exact about this and they taught concerning, "A boor cannot fear sin," "He was accustomed to saying" [and did not cite it as the words of Hillel the Elder]. To here [are his words]. And 'if it a received tradition, we will receive (accept it), but if it is for judgement, behold Rashi wrote explicitly that this is Hillel the Elder from the first chapter. And Rambam wrote about, "When I will be available, etc.," that this is similar to what came earlier from the commandments of Shammai his colleague, "And make your Torah study fixed." To here [are his words]. And [the Mishnah's redactor] placed these words of [Hilllel] here because Rabban Gamliel spoke about the matter of those that work with the community, etc.; and also to make them proximate to the receiving of the tradition by Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai from him, that we learned in Mishnah 8. And that is in itself the reason that caused the writer of the [Ten] Essays to [suggest that a more correct] text in the coming Mishnah [would read], "Hillel says;" and that is Hillel the Elder. 
<b>"Do not separate yourself from the congregation":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains, that [if he does separate himself,] "he will not see the consolation of the congregation." And I have an objection: that were it for this [reason], an adversary could disagree and say, "There is a metaphor [about this] - we say to a wasp (bee), 'not from your sting and not from your honey.'" And Rashi ends, "And he will never see a sign of blessing" - in the last chapter of Taanit. To here [are his words]. And one can also say that the consolation of the community is certainly greater than their trouble, since indeed 'the measure of good is greater.' And also (another explanation is) that he will not see, [meaning] and he will die before his time or he will be exiled from his place.
<b>"that cannot be heard":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "That is to say, do not let your words be unclear, etc., lest [people] err and come to heresy because of you." And if so, that is [the same thing] as [the teaching] of Avtalyon in the first chapter, Mishnah 11, and so, why would I need more? But Rambam does not explain it with regards to heresy, but rather that simple words should not be very distant and confound speech. As [Rambam] says your words should not require a far-fetched explanation or excessive examination, and [that only] then the listener would [understand them] (err). To here [are his words]. And it is not like the author of Midrash Shmuel understood, that [the explanation of] Rambam is like the words of Rabbi Bartenura.
<b>"for in the end it will be heard":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains, "Do not reveal your secret, etc., as in the end it will be heard, 'since the birds of the sky make the voice travel.'" As the beginning of the verse (Ecclesiastes 10:20) is, "In your mind do not curse a king, and in the chamber of your sleeping do not curse a wealthy man." 
<b>"Do not say, 'When I will be available'":</b> And it does not [create] an objection, according to the textual variant of Rashi, [whose text reads,] "that is possible to hear," and he explains it about the words of Torah, etc.; [that one could ask,] "If so, it is repetitive wording." For one, it is repeating it to strengthen the matter. And also, one could answer that it is coming to tell [us] even if it is not to listen from someone else, but rather just to study by yourself; do not say, "When I will be available, I will study." 

Mishnah 5

<b>"A boor cannot fear sin:"</b> See Mishnah 9 in the previous chapter and in the explanation of Rabbi Bartenura there. <b>"An ignorant person (<i>am haarets</i>):"</b> is explained in the words of Rabbi Bartenura in Chapter 5, Mishnah 10.
<b>"Not all who engage in a lot of business become wise (<i>mechakim</i> - literally, make wise):"</b> He said "all" because it is possible, and it has already been found that [some people who] engaged in much business became wise; as it happened with Rabbi Elazar ben Charsum or Ilfa. And many like them were cited by the commentators - Midrash Shmuel. And he also explained in the name of the pious one that it said, <i>mechakim</i>, which is a transitive verb, and goes back to what it said, "and an impatient person cannot teach;" and it [thus] says that all who engage in a lot of business do not make [others] wise - meaning to say that in free moments, he will teach others but he will not make them wise.
<b>"who engage in a lot of business:"</b> It specifically said, "who engage in a lot." As without buying and selling to sustain his body [financially], his Torah will also not exist, as we say later on, "If there is no flour, there is no Torah." And we also say above, "Excellent is the study of the Torah together with a worldly occupation."
<b>"strive (<i>hishtadel</i>):"</b> This [word refers to] a matter of training and thought about the thing. And the [Aramaic] translation of, "and a man struggled with him" (Genesis 32:25) is <i>veishtadel gavra imei</i> - Rambam. 

Mishnah 6

<b>"Since you drowned [others, others] drowned you. And in the end, those that drowned you will be drowned":</b> And you might say; if so it comes out that the first one who was killed, as you calculate backwards, did not kill. And behold, Hevel was killed by Kain, and [Hevel] did not kill [anyone]. And all the more so is there an objection from that which he said, "And in the end, those that drowned you will be drowned;" as maybe not, as it is an everyday occurrence [otherwise] - how many murderers have died in their beds through the hands of the Heavens (a natural death)? (And I did see this objection being raised in Midrash Rabbah, Parshat Veetchanan on the verse (Genesis 9:6), "The one that spills the blood of a man in a man, his blood will be spilled:" Said Rabbi Levi, "And behold, there are several people that killed and died in their beds!" They answered him, "What is 'in a man, his blood will be spilled?' When all people will come together in the future, at that time, his blood will be spilled." To here [are the words of the midrash]. And also about the first objection, behold, I saw that this statement, "Since you drowned, etc." is found in a bereita in the chapter [entitled] Hahalil (Sukkah 53); and over there, Rashi explained, "that was placed in the water and recognized that he was a murderer." To here [are his words].) And in the commentary of Rashi on our tractate, it is written, "There are some places that are not accustomed to saying this teaching." To here [are his words]. But Rambam and also Rabbi Bartenura and all of the commentaries record it. And the writer of Midrash Shmuel said to answer the objection about the end, that this is why he said, "And in the end, those that drowned;" which means to say through reincarnation - which is attested to in the words of our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, and Pythagoras concurred (and the other sages of the nations, as they are listed by Abarbanel in Parshat Tetzeh) - in the end, he will be drowned. And with the first objection, he stretched a great deal to say that Hevel was different, as they, may their memory be blessed, said that Hevel peeked at the holy. But [with] the skull, [Hillel] determined that he had killed, not that he peeked, as killing is more common than peeking. To here are his words. And it is not at all plausible in my eyes to say that Hillel's intention in this statement was only through the secret of reincarnation, which is in fact from the hidden things that are fitting to conceal, except 'from the few that are called by God.' And our holy rabbi (Rabbi) would not have wrote this statement and taught it in his Mishnah - as in the same way as 'a verse may not go away from its simple understanding,' so too a mishnah may not go away from its meaning, that will be understood by all - and he would have left this statement with the other statements that are passed down among them, which he left as oral and did not write in the mishnah. And I am also being exact [ to understand] the order of these mishnahs: that since this is only a statement about what happened - that he saw a skull - he should not have put it in 'between the scales of armor' - in between matters of ethics that were things that he would say, that he accustomed them in his mouth - and he should have placed this statement at the end. All the more so, since he said it in Aramaic, he should not have have mixed it in between the holy [language] and the holy [language].  And so [too], the words that he spoke were in front of the actual dead skull, and why did he not turn his face to speak towards the listeners; and so should he have said - "Since he drowned [others], he was drowned. And in the end, those that drowned him will be drowned." And also one should be exact, why did he use the wording, "even?" Therefore it appears to me to say that this is what it is saying: That just like he said, "A boor cannot, etc." and all that was like it to negate the base, so too did he see, etc. and he said to it, "Just like you drowned, etc.;" which is to say, it it probable, since the mind would give and the intellect would necessitate it, that "Since you drowned [others, others] will drown you. And in the end, those that drowned you will be drowned;" as in the measure that a person measures, in it will he be measured; as this is the [way of things] and so does the intellect necessitate. However in spite of all this, reality contradicts it; as behold many are killed and did not kill and many kill and are not killed. And in order to make reality conform and not contradict that which the intellect necessitates - and that is that nonetheless everything is according to the trait of truth and that righteous judgment is done - therefore he would say and he accustomed it in his mouth, "The more flesh, the more worms, etc." to accustom it in the mouths of the people [to understand] that in everything there is a real necessity in truth and in the trait of justice [that it be so], as behold, you find, "The more flesh, the more worms, etc." regarding the base, and "the more Torah, the more life, etc." regarding the virtuous - behold, the traits that operate in the world are straight and perfect. And from those which are revealed, you can judge about the 'ones concealed for the Lord our God,' that they also follow the just and straight, only that we do not have the power to understand them and to master their content; as the matter that is stated (Isaiah 55:8), "For My thoughts are not your thoughts and your ways are not My ways." And, if so, it comes out that he did not say this statement, "Since you drowned, etc." as a matter of fact - that it has to happen this way and that this is how it will be - but rather as an assumption is he saying it; that this is the assumption according to the intellect. And since its contradiction is famous, so that a man not, God forbid, come to say that 'there is no judgement and no Judge;' therefore he would say and he accustomed it in his mouth to make the larger community hear, "The more flesh, etc., the more Torah," to say that from that which our eyes see, we can judge with sound reason and mind that just like these follow in [proper] order - whether for the bad or for the good - so [too] all of the [occurrences] in the world follow in [proper] order - and even though we don't have the power to grasp [them]. And since this statement of "Since you drowned, etc." is not an absolute decree that this will definitely happen - as behold, it is possible that the drowned did not drown [others], and so [too] that the drowner will not be drowned - hence he did not say this statement in order to state it [in such a ways as] to let the masses hear, but rather between he and himself did he say it; to the skull which is a bone that does not hear. And he made the assumption that this is fitting [to be,] that "Since you drowned, etc." And the objection is also not explicit at all, but through the statement that comes after it; that from now on, he would say, "The more flesh, etc., [such that] the educated one would understand very well. And all matters like this are fitting to say [in such a way] that it is the educated ones that will understand [it] but not all the listeners, lest [such a listener] will prove from that which his ears hear and judge from what his eyes see that the question is true and that there is no answer to it, as he will not comprehend or even understand [the answer] and he will, if so, stay confused by the question, and, God forbid, come to a stumbling block. And he said it in Aramaic, which was the language that was customarily in the mouths of the masses in those days, as is proven in Mishnah Shekalim 5. As behold, his speaking as if he was speaking with the skull of the robbers was also so that the masses would understand his statement according to its [simple] meaning, that it is so, "Since your drowned, etc." And the educated ones will understand his speech and his idea in that which he said afterwards, "The more flesh, etc." and [that is why] he said it in the holy tongue. So does it appear in my eyes.
<b>"those that drowned you will be drowned":</b> To make us understand that even the many that killed an individual, all of them will be killed; therefore he said to this one skull that its drowners, even if they are many, will be drowned - Midrash Shmuel.
<b>"will be drowned":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that "the matter was not given to their hands to kill you, etc. 'as guilt is passed on to the guilty,' etc." And this is the opinion of Rambam in Chapter 8 of the Chapters that he had introduce his commentary to this tractacte: that even though it was according to the law of the Holy One, blessed be He, that this one should be killed, He did not decree on this one that he should kill him. As that would be as if the Holy One, blessed be He, would say about those to be born in the future, that these will be righteous and these will be evil. And this is true. And it is not for this [reason] that x is obligated to do evil and to be evil, etc., but [rather] it is his own choice that he did and made the evil. Hence, 'he will surely be punished' and 'there are many messengers to the Omnipresent' [who will effect] that this one will be killed. And since this man is a man of blood and guilty, it is passed on to him [to kill the first one] and the Holy One, blessed be He, will bring his payment upon his head. And so did he write at the end of Mishneh Torah, Repentance 6.  And even though Ramban in Parshat Lech Lecha answered these words and said that even if He decreed that x will do bad to y, if someone came first and fulfilled the decree of the Holy One, blessed be He, [by killing y], [that one] merited in [doing] the matter of a commandment (<i>devar mitsvah</i>), and he wrote more at length; I say that even if we concede to his words - that if someone else came first, he merited - nonetheless it is not an answer to the words of Rambam. As the one that did that evil which the words of Rambam are speaking about, did not, however, act and do [it] to fulfill the statement of the King, may He be blessed, but rather the wickedness of his heart brought him to this; and 'the Merciful One seeks the heart.' And when the words of Rambam are understood like this, also the criticism of Ravad there falls away. [This is what] appears to me.  

Mishnah 7

<b>"The more flesh, the more worms":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that [it means] "in the grave; and worms are as hard for the dead as a needle is for living flesh." And Midrash Shmuel explained in the name of Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan and these are his words: "It is not that their opinion was that the dead feel [anything], but rather that anyone with a clear mind will want to be pained in his lifetime by [this] disgrace that will occur upon his death and he should try to minimize the disgrace; and from now he should think [about] and feel the worms that will bite him, in the same way as he feels a needle in the living flesh, and [as a result,] he will minimize his disgrace and not engage in eating much meat, as 'The more meat, the more worms.'" To here are [his words]. And I did not understand him - why would a living man grieve about his disgrace and he is 'carried to a grave' and covered in the dirt and no one sees and who knows from these things? Will the worms overpower him or the maggots eat him up? Since there is no one to see his disgrace, it comes out that the disgrace is not considered anything. All the more so [as] when he is disgraced when he is there, behold, he is dead and there is no one with him to know anything of the disgrace. If so, for what reason should he be pained about this when he is still alive and living? However 'their words are said in truth,' as for the dead himself, it is difficult. And it is not that they established feeling for the dead in this and made from something that is not something that is. But [rather] they spoke about this difficulty with regards to the soul of the dead, who sees the disgrace of the body and is very pained about this. And behold the soul does [continue to] exist and the sages of the nations also agreed to this, meaning to the survival of the soul. And this is [the meaning of] what the verse states (Job 14:22), "But about his flesh he pains and his soul mourns upon him." It can be said, "his flesh he pains (<i>yikhav</i>)" like the explanation of Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra, "It is an expression of destruction, as in (II Kings 3:19), 'and every good portion you shall destroy (<i>takhivu</i>);' and it is a borrowed expression for things that do no feel, that destruction for them is like pain to a person." To here [are his words].  And he [so] elucidates [this] verse that, in fact, his soul mourns upon it with this 'pain' that it sees and knows and recognizes in its body that it was in. (And from this verse, one opinion learned, in the end of of the chapter [entitled] Shoel [Shabbat 152b], "that everything that is said in front of the dead, he knows until his flesh is consumed.") And about this was their intention when they said, "worms are as hard for the dead;" meaning to say, from the perspective of the soul that knows this. And know that this was their opinion, may their memory be blessed, as with the dead, they did not mention [the word,] flesh and with the living, they said, "for living flesh." And they should have [otherwise] made the expression be parallel, and they should have said, "as a needle for the living;" or they should have said also "for the flesh of the dead." But [really] their opinion was that it was difficult for the dead, not for his dead flesh that does not feel at all, but to the "dead it is difficult," by which they wanted to say, to his soul. And do not wonder that the word, "dead," is used for the soul; as so is it said in the verse (Deuteronomy 18:11), "and one who seeks the dead." And without a doubt, it [is speaking about] the dead souls, but with regards to the seeking which is in a place where there are dead bodies, [since] that is the place of the seeking, therefore it says, "he seeks the dead;" even though the seeking itself is for these dead souls. Here too, the difficulty is for the dead soul, and with regards to that which the act that creates the difficulty is on the dead [body] itself, the linguist is able to say, "it is difficult for the dead;" even though the intention about who the difficulty reaches is the dead soul. So does it appear to me. (And later I saw in the book Kolbo in the laws of mourning that he wrote that the reason for burial is because it is difficult for the soul when it sees the body disgraced and laying without burial; and in this way, they said, "Worms are as hard for the dead as a needle is for living flesh" - and this comparison is a comparison in the existence of difficulty and not [an exact] comparison. To here are [his words]. I also found in Teshuvot haRashba 369, that he also wrote as something obvious that there is no pain to the dead from a needle, and that this is proven [from the] embalmers.)
<b>"has acquired for himself (<i>leatsmo</i>)":</b> For his benefit in this world - Midrash Shmuel in the name of R. Y. Ibn Nachmias. (And I found support for this explanation, as so did we learn in Mishnah Shekalim 1:4, "that the priests expound this verse for themselves;" and Rabbi Bartenura explains, "for their benefit." And nonetheless, it appears to me to explain that its matter is that he acquired his essence (<i>atsmuto</i>), and it means to say that when he has a good name, behold, he becomes actualized and he is something; as anything that does not have a good name, behold, it is as if it were not [in existence]. And it is known that the delineation of a name is what indicates the essence of a thing, as this is [the explanation of that which] Adam called all living things [by] names. And hence if the name is good, behold it is an indication about his essence; as if there is no good name, it is fitting for him that he were not [in existence]. And [so] it is as if he were not [in existence] and there is no acquisition of anything here.)

Mishnah 8

<b>Received [the tradition] from Hillel and Shammai:</b> In Hillel's line it was not necessary to mention that they received it from him. And now it mentions [it] with Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai as he was not from his grandchildren. And also because he had many students, and disagreements grew among them and after them, it mentions [it to say] that even though they disagreed in certain laws, nonetheless, they received [and agreed] upon the main part of the Torah. And [it is] as I explained in the beginning of the first chapter.
<b>"because for this you were created":</b> For this reason did you come out [of the womb] to the air of the world, as it is written (Genesis 1:31), "and it was day and it was night, the sixth day" - [distinguishing the sixth day by calling it the sixth day and not just a sixth day, as with the other days] teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, made the work of creation conditional: if Israel does not accept the Torah, the world will go back to being chaos and void (Shabbat 88a). It comes out now that there is a great obligation placed upon him and he is not doing it as a favor [to God] - Rashi.
<b>Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai had five students:</b> It only counted the great ones to whom the tradition was passed on. However, he had many other students [as well] - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbats.
<b>Eliezer ben Horkenos:</b> Since they were his students, he would call them by their names [and not by their titles] - Rashi.
<b>"a pit of plaster (<i>sid</i>)" and there is another version, "covered in plaster (<i>sud</i>)":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that this is the [correct] variant - and not a pit of plaster (<i>sid</i>). As a pit of plaster means to say a pit [holding] plaster, and what praise is there in this? Rather it is pit that is properly plastered and holds the water, such that earth does not absorb it [through its cracks]. And its complete form is <i>siyud</i> and its lacking of a [letter] <i>yod</i> comes by way of a 'resting middle letter of a root' - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbats. And in the commentary of Rashi in the fourth chapter of Avodah Zarah 55, he records, "a pit of plaster" like the textual variant of the book [of Avot commonly in use].
<b>"that does not lose a drop":</b> meaning to say that it is in this matter that he is similar to a plastered pit and not in all of its aspects. As there are also inferior [matters connected with such a] pit, since its waters are not sweet like a spring of living waters as they are only gathered and not gushing at all; and also they are spoiled by the taste of the plaster. And therefore it needed to explain, "that does not lose a drop" - Midrash Shmuel.
<b>"pious":</b> Rabbi Batenura explained, "[one] who does beyond the letter of the law." And see what I have written at the end of Tractate Sotah.
<b>"fears sin":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[He is] strict upon himself, etc., as if it is not like this, what is the novelty, etc.," as above, Mishnah 8. And see what I have written at the end of [Tractate] Sotah.
<b>"including Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that he found it written that Abba Shaul is not arguing with the first teacher [in this mishnah], etc. And, nonetheless, since his words are coming upon the words of the first teacher, it is necessary to mention that even Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos - who you have praised so much - even he is included, etc. But with the first teacher whose words came first, it is not necessary to explain: as when he said, "all the sages of Israel," Elazar ben Arakh is automatically also included with them - Midrash Shmuel. 

Mishnah 9

<b>"Go out and see":</b> As we say [more] generally (Berakhot 19a), "He went out, he was exact and he found." And the intention of all this is the going out of the intellect and its exertion to examine with deliberation and to understand well. And this is the expression [here], "see," as in (Ecclesiastes 1:16), "and my heart saw much wisdom." And [it is written] in Midrash Shmuel [that Rabbi Y. Abarbanel had the textual variant at the beginning, "Come and see;"] and that Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan testified that this is the variant in all of the books in Toledo and all of its [surrounding] districts. And he explained that since the good path was there with him, he said to them, "Come and see;" but with the evil path, he said, "Go out and see," as evil did not dwell with him.
<b>"that a person should cling to":</b> Midrash Shmuel wrote [that] Rabbenu Yonah explained that certainly one should cling to all of the good character traits, but rather he meant to say in one trait should [a person be] always complete. As it is better for a person to grab on to one trait completely always - and it makes it easier for him to achieve all of the important good traits - than for him to have a few character traits and not to be complete in any of them. To here [are his words]. And the lips should kiss [this]. To here are [his words]. And I say that it sits well with this. As even though these sages said, "what is the straight path, etc.;" behold Rabbi - who was after them - went back and said, as we learned in the beginning of this chapter, "Which is the straight path, etc. As he did not say about one character trait that he should cling to it and through it [alone] he become perfect as was stated, but rather he said that in each and every character trait that a person encounters - in [what] he does and [how] he acts - what is the path that a person should choose such that he can distinguish that this is [what he should] do and [how he should] act. That is why Rabbi said, "he should choose," and he did not say, "cling," like here.
<b>"One who borrows but does not repay":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "this is the opposite of 'seeing the consequences,' etc. And he did not say just, 'not seeing the consequences of one's actions,' as it is possible for him to be able to rescue himself when that consequence comes to him." And [according to this], one must say that that which he wrote above, "and from this, he calculated, etc." is not the main understanding of "seeing the consequences;" but rather, that from it also extends that "he calculates, etc." But the main intention of "seeing the consequences" is that which he explains [first], "One who looks out and sees what will be in the future" - and this is in all of his matters and dealings. As with "through this, he calculates, etc.," it is not relevant to say that he will rescue, etc. And in Midrash Shmuel, he writes in the name of Rabbi Y. Lirma that even if "seeing the consequences of one's actions" is a good path, one who does not see the consequences of his actions is not bad; since we have found many people that even if they do not see the consequences of their actions follow the straight path, or people who keep the Torah for the sake of Heaven and not for hope of a reward nor from the fear of any punishment, but rather for its own sake - which is the most complete type of service. And for this reason, Rabbi Shimon did not say that the evil path is the one who does not see the consequences of his actions. To here [are his words].
<b>"The Omnipresent (literally, the Place)":</b> He is the Place of the world. And so [too], it states (Deuteronomy 33:27), "and below are the Forearms of the world." But the world cannot contain Him, as it is stated (I Kings 8), "the heavens and the heavens of the heavens cannot contain You" - Rashi.
<b>"'but the righteous one'":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains, that [it is speaking about] the Holy One, blessed be He, who is the righteous One of the world, as it states, (Deuteronomy 32:4), "He is righteous and straight." And so [too], (Nehemiah 9:33), "And You are righteous about all that befalls us." 

Mishnah 10

<b>"The honor of your friend should be as dear to you as your own":</b> And he is not arguing with that which we learn later in Chapter 4, Mishnah 12, "the honor of your friend like the fear of your teacher." Since over there, it is [dealing with] friends (colleagues) in Torah [study] - Derekh Chaim. And in Midrash Shmuel, it is written that there are some editions that have the textual variant here, "The honor of your student, etc." And [Midrash Shmuel] wrote that it is impossible to [say the correct] reading is "the honor of your friend should be like yours." As, if so, if he is someone who, by nature, is not exacting about his [own] honor, it would come out that he would also not be concerned with his friend's honor. And this is certainly not [correct]. And so did King David say (Psalms 15:2-3), "He who walks innocently, etc. The disgraced is disgusting in his eyes, but those that fear the Lord he honors." However with a student it would be well justified that they said, "the honor of your student should be be like your own" - as it is enough for the student to be like his teacher [and never more]. To here [are his words]. And it appears to me that if it is for this, there would be no argument. As the teacher only said that [his friend's] honor should be dear to him like his own, when his own honor is dear to him. And that is why he did not say, "The honor of your friend should be like yours in your eyes," [even though] it would be briefer [and therefore preferable]. But rather, he is speaking about one whose own honor is dear to him, and so he lengthened the expression by saying "dear to you." And know that this is the case, as behold in Mishnah 12, when Rabbi Yosi says, "The money of your friend should be as dear to you as your own;" would it enter your mind that if a person is squandering and wasting his [own] money, that he is also allowed to squander and waste the money of his friend? But rather Rabbi Yosi was not speaking concerning [such a] man. But rather, he was only speaking about one whose [own] money is also dear to him. Here too, concerning honor, [Rabbi Eliezer] only spoke about one whose [own] honor is also dear to him.
<b>"be cautious around their coals":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that you should not treat them with lightheartedness. And this is the language of Rambam: When you associate with sages and with people of lofty virtue, do not be playful with them and do not be arrogant towards them, but [rather] let your association show them that you will approach at the time that they will bring you close. And do not go on to come closer than that which they bring you close; so that you not lose their intention towards you and turn their love into hate, and the virtue from them that you hope for will not reach you. And he compared this to one who warms up with a fire; that if he sits far from it, he will enjoy its heat, (etc.) [but if he goes on approaching [it], he will get burned]. 
<b>"for their bite is the bite of a fox, etc.":</b> Which is to say that sometimes they hurt with a full act, and this is like a bite. And he said it is like the bite of a fox as its healing is difficult. And sometimes when they hurt it is without a full act, and that is only like a sting. And he said it it is like the sting of a scorpion. And sometimes they only hurt with speech and he said that this is like the hiss of a Seraph. So does it appear to me. (However, it appears to me also that these expressions are nicknames for [various types of] rabbinic excommunications, as it is found that the sages of the gemara used nicknames [for such things] - such as "he would have put out sparks of fire in your face" in the chapter [entitled] Hazahav (Bava Metzia 47a), and as in the chapter [entitled] Hamerubah (Bava Kamma 81b), "we would have smashed your thigh with an iron club." Here too, these nicknames in our mishnah are also [used] as expressions of [various types of] excommunications of the sages of the mishnah.)
<b>"the hiss of a Seraph":</b> [It means whistle with his mouth. 
In Old French, it is <i>sifflet</i>, in the same way as the geese do, one to another - Rashi.
<b>"a Seraph":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "This seraph-snake does not accept hisses (to charm him) like other snakes, as it written, 'Which will not listen to the voice of charmers.'" As the verse before it (Psalms 58:7) ends, "like a deaf python closes its ear." And that which Rabbi Bartenura writes, "Thus [too] is the Torah scholar - if you upset him and come to appease him, he will not accept appeasement," Rambam [fills in], "and you should know this from the matter of Gechazi;" who protested in front of his teacher, Elisha, [and] fell into a disgusting sickness, as is explained in the words of the sages about the matter of the four leprous men. And so [too] with others; and with all of them, the damage that they received is explained.
<b>"and all of their words are like burning coals":</b> even the lightest of the light [among them], as he [would be] breaching the words of the sages. For example, seclusion with a single [woman]: As an undifferentiated woman is [considered to be] a menstruant, as it is stated (Leveticus 15:19), "she will be in her menstruation" - until she goes in the waters. (And we learn in Mishnah Niddah 5:3, "A one day old baby girl gives off the impurity of a menstruant.") And the sages made a decree [about a single woman] even if she immerses, as behold they decreed about seclusion with a single [woman], making no difference whether she is pure or whether she is impure - Rashi.

Mishnah 11

<b>"The evil eye":</b>Rabbi Bartenura explains, "[It is] like 'an evil eye.'" And [Rabbi Yehoshua] said that it removes a person from the world, and it is not necessary to say that a person should distance itself from it. And therefore Rabbi Yehoshua said above that the path that a person should distance himself from is a bad friend, [as] that is a greater novelty. So is it explained in Midrash Shmuel. 
<b>"The evil impulse":</b> The enormity of desire - Rambam.
<b>"and hatred of the creations":</b> Rabbi Bartenura writes that Rambam explains that he despises the company of the creations and loves to sit alone. And this is his language: [This is] badness of the spirit and it is a sickness of the black bile, which brings a person to despise the vision of his eyes and he hates it. And he prefers the company of animals, and [so] he isolates himself in wildernesses and in forests and chooses for himself an uninhabited place. And with them, this is not from the angle of asceticism, but rather because of the badness of their desire and envy of others. These [characteristics] will kill a person, without a doubt, as his body will get sick and he will die before his time. To here [are his words]. And [about] that which Rabbi Bartenura also writes, "[this is referring to] a hard man, who brings the hatred of the creations upon him;" Midrash Shmuel writes, "there are some that explain that all curse him and their curse falls upon him, and [so] he leaves the world; as the sages, may their memory be blessed, say (Megillah 15a), 'Do not let the curse of a commoner be light in your eyes, etc.'" <b>"Remove a person from this world:"</b> See Chapter 4, Mishnah 21.

Mishnah 12

<b>"The money of your friend should be as dear to you as your own":</b> See what I have written on Mishnah 10.
<b>"Prepare yourself to study Torah":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Such that you not say, 'Since my father was a sage, etc., the Torah will come back to its lodgings, etc.'" As such did the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expound on the verse (Isaiah 59:21), "will not move from your mouth and from the mouth of your seed and from the mouth of the seed of your seed, said the Lord, from now and forever," in Chapter 7 of Bava Metzia 85. And Rabbi Yosi comes to let us understand that these words apply when he prepares himself for it, [then] they will be established in him more than in another. But if not, [then] not.

Mishnah 13

<b>"Be careful in the reciting of Shema and with prayer":</b> Because they are the acceptance of the yolk of Heaven and service to Him, may He be blessed, therefore he warned about them the most. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote that Rabbenu Yonah had the textual variant, "in the reciting of the Shema more than with prayer." And he explained that the reason is that the time of [morning] prayers is long - up until four hours; and the time of reciting the Shema is short - according to the stringent, with the rising of the sun [only]. And that is the [reason] for the expression, "be careful;" as this requires great care. To here [are his words]. 

Mishnah 14

<b>"Be diligent in learning Torah, that you respond to one who denigrates the Torah":</b> Rabbenu Yonah, may his memory be blessed, explained, "Be diligent and toil in the study of Torah, so that you will know what to respond to the one who denigrates the Torah." So is it written in Midrash Shmuel. And it comes out that we learn that [he did] not have the textual variant, "Know;" and so does it appear in the commentary of Rambam, that [he did] not have the variant, "Know." But in other books, we do have the variant, "Know what to respond, etc." And Midrash Shmuel wrote in the name of Rabbi M. Almosnino, that for this [reason] did it write, "Know what to respond:" That which you respond to the one who denigrates the Torah - you must know it with complete knowledge and your response to him should not be convincing [only] to you or rote, since in such a way you will not defeat him. To here [are his words]. And in that which he says, "what to respond," he is informing that you should not go to them, to challenge them about their reasoning; but rather, if they came to you and challenge you, "know what to respond to" them. However, you should not initiate, to sic the dog upon yourself - Midrash Shmuel.
<b>"diligent":</b> See the commentary of Rabbi Bartnenura on Mishnah Sotah 9:15.
<b>"To one who denigrates the Torah (<i>apikoros</i>)":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explains [that it] is an expression of being ownerless (<i>hefker</i>), as he disgraces the Torah; and so [too] one who disgraces those that study it, as he concludes in the second explanation. And hence did he explain explicitly at the beginning of the chapter [entitled] Chelek (Sanhedrin 99b). 
<b>"Know before Whom you labor":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "In this response that you give to the one who denigrates the Torah, such that your heart not be seduced to inclining towards his opinion." At first glance, according to his explanation, "before whom" refers to the one who denigrates the Torah. Yet it appears that his words are copied from Rambam and [the latter] explains that "before Whom" refers to God, may He be blessed. And this is his language: And he said, "Even though you study the opinions of the [other] nations to know how you should respond to them, be careful that nothing from these opinions enter into your heart. And know that the One before Whom you work knows that which is hidden in your heart." And that is [why] he said, "Know before Whom you labor;" meaning to say that he direct his heart to faith in God, may He be blessed. To here [are his words].
<b>"The Master of your work is reliable to pay you the reward, etc.":</b> In Midrash Shmuel at the end of our chapter, [its author] wrote in the name of the teacher, Rabbenu Yonah, may his memory be blessed, that that which Rabbi Elazar said, "reliable, etc." is not disagreeing with the statement, "Do not be like servants, etc." in Mishnah 3 of the first chapter. And I already wrote about this at the beginning of our chapter, in the words [that begin], "Also weigh." And in any event, this matter is not connected to [Rabbi Elazar's] earlier words. And I found a checked text of the Land of Israel that had the textual variant, "and who is the Master of your work;" and then nothing more. 

Mishnah 15



Mishnah 16

<b>"If you have learned much Torah, your reward will be much":</b> Since he said earlier, "and the reward is great," a person could be led from this to say, "Behold, I will receive much reward when I learn for an hour, and then I will sit idle from Torah [study], as I will already have much reward to receive." Therefore he said, "If you have learned much Torah, your reward will be much," [meaning] that if [you do not learn much, then] not. As behold - [it is] just the opposite - you [would receive] the punishment for neglecting Torah [study]. So did Midrash Shmuel write. And that which we learned in Menachot 101 at the end [of the tractate, as follows,] sits well with this: It is stated regarding a burnt offering of a bird, "a fire that is a pleasing smell" and regarding a grain offering, "a fire that is a pleasing smell;" to teach you that it is one, whether one does much or little, etc.; which is that since it is likely that the one who sacrifices the grain offering is poor - as Rashi explains in Parshat Vayikra, [on] "a soul that sacrifices a grain offering:" "Who is it that it is his way to volunteer a grain offering? A poor person;" to here [are his words] -  it is in this that the teacher says that they are equal, because the poor person does according to his ability and his money. Therefore his little is worth the same before God, may He be blessed, as the much of the wealthy person. But certainly one, within which's power is to do much and [only] does little; he is certainly not equal to the one who does much. And so too, when the poor person does more than the grain offering, certainly his reward is also greater [than the wealthy one]. And we only say that the one who does much and the one who does little are equal when we also evaluate the [relative wealth] of the donors, and as we said. And also in our mishnah, when we say, "if you have learned much," it is speaking about one who can. And it is explained similarly to this in Derekh Chaim, and see Chapter 4, Mishnah 10.  <b>"your reward will be much:"</b> Regarding payments [as is found at the end of this mishnah], it is not relevant to say much, as payments are only what is fitting to pay [according to the wage or price] and not much - Derekh Chaim.
<b>"and the Master of your work is trustworthy to pay you the wage for your activity":</b> And it should not enter your mind that when you receive the gift that is hinted to by "gift" and by "much," that it will be deducted from your wage - Midrash Shmuel. 
<b>"And know, the giving of reward to the righteous is in the future to come":</b> Which means to say that, that which I say to you, "is trustworthy, etc.;" my intention is not that you should serve in order to receive a reward - rather, my intention is this: only that you should know it intellectually, and as above. And some have the textual variant, [in the words], "the giving of reward (<i>matan secharan</i>)" with a [letter], <i>shin</i> (<i>shematan</i>, meaning "that the giving of the reward"). And according to that variant, one can say that it is coming to say that even the reward which is the gift, 'it is not in this world.' And therefore, do not wonder when you see that the righteous are going from one misfortune to another. So is it written in Midrash Shmuel.

Perek 3



Mishnah 1

<b>Akavia: "From a putrid drop":</b> He [lived] during the time of the Temple, as we learned in Mishnah Eduyot 5:6 that "The gates of the [Temple] courtyard would not be sealed in front of any man with the wisdom or fear of sin that [belonged] to Akavia ben Mehalalel." Nonetheless, [the redactor] did not want to interrupt in the middle of the chain of Hillel until Rabbi and his son. And afterwards, he went back to the order of the [transmission of the] tradition, and he mentioned Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai, who received from [Hillel]. And afterwards, it mentioned the statements of his students and made proximate to them the statement of Rabbi Tarfon, which is similar to the statement of Rabbi Elazar, the last of his students.   
<b>"Know""</b> He went back and said the word, "know," because "before Whom are you destined, etc.," is not with a physical keeping of one's eye and vision, but rather that he should believe it intellectually - Midarsh Shmuel.
<b>"from where (<i>me'ayin</i>) you came, and to where (<i>le'an</i>) you are going":</b> The question of the place from which you come [uses the] term,  <i>ayin</i>, as in  "<i>me'ayin</i> (from where) did the people come." And the question of the place to which he will go uses the term, <i>anah</i>, as in (Psalms 139:7) "<i>Anah</i> (To where) will I go from Your spirit and <i>anah</i> (to where) will I run away from in front of You?" And in one verse (Judges 19:17) concerning the concubine in Givah , both of them [are present] - "<i>anah</i> (to where) are you going and  <i>me'ayin</i> (from where) are you coming" - Derekh Chaim. And [in] the word, <i>le'an</i>, the [letter] <i>alef</i> is vocalized with a <i>kamatz</i> [vowel].
<b>"where are you going":</b> As man is going to his [grave] and is approaching death, as 'the day of death is from the day of his birth.' Since from the day that he is born, he approaches and goes towards death - and therefore he uses present tense and not future tense - Midrash Shmuel. 
<b>"To a place of dust, worms, and maggots":</b> And he did not say, "he will be dust, worms, and maggots." As so did the verse (Genesis 3:19) say, "as you are dirt and you will return to the dirt" - Derekh Chaim. 
<b>"to give an account and a reckoning":</b> It is speaking about the beginning of the accounting (judgement) and therefore it had account precede reckoning. And he said, "to give an account," to say that if he sins, he is obligated an accounting from it - hence, it is relevant to say that he gives an accounting. As, [for example,] he who has sexual intercourse with a forbidden relation is obligated to give an accounting as a result of this. And therefore it says "to give an accounting." And so [too], that which is written in Bava Kamma 73b in the chapter [entitled] Hasefinah concerning [those] (two) geese, "In the future, Israel will have to give an accounting upon them" - Derekh Chaim.

Mishnah 2

<b>"For the welfare of the government:"</b> That [means] the king and his ministers and his advisors who run his kingdom and administer law in the land. And that is why it did not say, "for the welfare of the king." So did the commentators explain. 
<b>"this is a session of scorners:"</b> As there is no greater scorn than one to whom they say, "Count gold coins for an hour, and every thing that you count will be yours;" and he is idle [from doing this. Such a one] certainly scorns the gold coins and disgraces them. So [too] is one who is idle from words of Torah - since he knows [its] great reward, he is nothing but a scorner. And so said the wise one, "Woe to the creatures from the insult of Torah" - behold, he called one is idle from Torah, an insulter. So did he explain it in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed.  He also explained and was precise in the expression, "there are no [words] between them, etc.:" the intention is that when they are sitting even though they are involved in Torah [study] each one by himself, there is however [nothing] "between them," since they did not associate together to study as a group. And this is only because each one is foolish and is scornful in his heart about the knowledge and learning of his fellow and thinks that he has nothing to gain from his company with him - and that is why "there are no words of Torah between them." [This] means that they are not studying together, [so] certainly they are called scorners, even though no one opens his mouth and calls [them on it]. And Rambam wrote, "His proof that any session wherein they do not speak words of Torah is called, "a session of scorners" is from the end of the (next) verse, that states "But his desire is in the Torah of the Lord, etc." - as if it said, since his desire was for the Torah of the Lord, he did not sit in a session of scoffers that has no Torah of the Lord in it.
<b>"the Divine Presence rests with them":</b> [This is] the opposite of the scoffers, as [the latter] are the group that do not see the face of the Divine Presence, (as it said in Sotah 42 at the end of the chapter [entitled] Elu Neemarin). However these are the opposite: as the scoffers - even in their death - the Divine Presence distances Itself from them; all the more so during their lives. And these - even during their lives - the Divine Presence dwells with them; all the more so in their death - Midrash Shmuel. 
<b>"[studying Torah]":</b> Since an individual [who is alone] is not accustomed to putting out words of Torah from his mouth, therefore it is not relevant to say with him, "[studying] words of Torah (<i>divrei Torah</i>);" as it is with two, who are speaking one with the other. 
<b>"that the Holy One, Blessed be He, determines a reward for him? As it is said, 'He sits alone and is silent, since he takes [a reward] for it'”:</b>  Rabbi Bartenura explained, "As if the giving of the entire Torah was for his sake alone." And so [too] did Rambam explain. However his textual variant was like the variant of the books that is written in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Ramah. And so is it written in Derekh Chaim: There are books that have the textual variant, "From where [is there proof that] that even [when there is only] one [person studying Torah], the verse considers it as he kept the entire Torah? As it is said, 'He sits alone and is silent, since he takes [a reward] for it.'” To here [are his words]. And according to the textual variant of the book [that we have, the correct understanding] appears to be that which is written in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rambam, who explains that, "since he takes [a reward]" [means] that a full reward is sent to him; or that behold, he is like one who has already taken his reward, as it is [already] prepared. To here [are his words]. And see in the commentary of Rashi that I will soon quote, who gives a different explanation. And I saw in Midrash Shmuel that he wrote the words of Rabbi Bartenura as they are in front of us, and that [Rabbi Bartenura] explained further, "'since he takes (<i>natal</i>) [a reward] for it (<i>aliv</i>, literally upon it)' is an expression of covering: the [Aramaic] translation of (Exodus 40:3) 'and you will cover' is '<i>vetatel</i>;' which is to say the Divine Presence hovers upon him to protect him from 'every anguish and distress,' to be a shade over his head." To here [are his words]. And in our books, this commentary is written at the end of Mishnah  7 in the words of Rabbi Bartenura. And I also saw there in the book, Midrash Shmuel, in the commentary of Rashi, may his memory be blessed, that he quoted on this mishnah, and [then] he wrote,"It is written in Mishnah 6 in the commentary of Rashi, '"and is silent, since he takes [a reward] for” that [study]; and some say, it is an expression of covering, as in , "and you will cover."'" And also in the commentary of Rashi that is printed in Derekh Chaim is this commentary written. And if I were not afraid, I would say that its place is later and not here - as over there we say that the Divine Presence rests and even on one - and [I would also say] that Rashi has a textual variant there, “As it is stated, 'He sits alone and is silent, since he takes [a reward] for it;'” and he does not have the [standard text], "In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you." And it also appears to me that Rashi has a textual variant that has "In every place, etc." here, and that is why he did not explain anything about it, as it does not require any explanation. As it is explicitly written, "and bless you," and there is no greater determination of reward than this. So does it appear in my eyes. And in Derekh Chaim, he wrote that in our books, the text reads, "From where [is there proof that] that even [when there is only] one [person studying Torah], the Divine Presence is with him and the Holy One, blessed be He determines a reward for him? As it is said, 'He sits alone, etc.'” To here [are his words]. And according to this textual variant, we can say that Rashi is explaining here, "'and is silent, since he takes [a reward] for it,'"  as in "and you will cover, etc." And in the first chapter of Berakhot 6a, [it is written], "And since even one, do I need [to say] two? [With] two, their words are written in the Book of Remembrance; [with] one, his words are not written." To here [are the words of the Talmud]. And that which [the mishnah] adds with one [person] that "the Holy One, blessed be He, determines a reward for him" is not excluding two from reward, but rather it is because with one, the verse explains it explicitly, as it is written, "since he takes [a reward] for it." And we expound it to two of them, as in "and you should cover it;" and so too [is it] with the receiving of reward. And for this reason did the verse explain it with one - so that from it you will learn, all the more so for two.  

Mishnah 3

<b>"Three who ate":</b> In Midrash Shmuel, [its author] explained in the name of Lev Avot that [the teacher of the mishnah] took [the number] three, as there in the verse that he brought as a proof it also speaks about three - and they are the wise man, the priest and the prophet. And the pious one, may his memory be blessed, gave a reason why three: that if two are occupied in speech, they would be considered as inadvertent transgressors; but when they are three, the third was there to remind them. And Rashbam wrote that he took three, since an undifferentiated table has three to introduce [the Grace after Meals].
<b>"And did not say upon it words of Torah":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And with the Grace after Meals that we bless upon the table, we fulfill our obligation. And it is considered as if we said words of Torah upon it." And the blessings are three - as [the fourth blessing of] "the Good" was established [by the rabbis] in Yavneh - and it comes out that it corresponds to the three amot (the measurement, understood by some as indicating a tripartite study at the table, in the verse cited) later on. And they also correspond to Torah, Prophets and Writings: as Moshe established the first [blessing, and about the Torah] it is stated (Malachi 3:22), "Remember the Torah of Moshe"; and Yehoshua established the second one and he is the first of the books of the Prophets; and David and Shlomo established the third one, and they were the first [authors] of the books of the Writings. And according to those that say that [the three amot] correspond to Scripture, Mishnah and Talmud, it appears to me to be explained according to the way that is expounded in the second chapter of Eruvin 21 (based on the verse in Song of Songs 7:13), "'Let us rise up early to the vineyards' - these are the synagogues and study halls; 'let us see whether the vine has blossomed' - these are the men of Scripture; 'the bud has opened' - these are the men of Mishnah; 'and whether the pomegranates have developed' - these are the men of Talmud." And Rashi explained, "the bud is greater than the blossom; so [too] is Mishnah more elucidated than the Scriptures. 'Whether the pomegranates have developed': [meaning] they have completely grown, etc." And so [too] do you find in these three blessings: as the second is more elucidated than the first, as in the first one there is only mention of the food that God, may He be blessed, feeds us, and in the second [also the] 'good land that he bequeathed' to us 'to eat from its fruit and to be satiated from its goodness'; and the third one is even more elucidated, as it prays for the food - "feed us, sustain us - also about the building of the Temple which is the goal of the bequest of the land, as there will we serve God. And even though I have marked signs to compare the Grace after Meals to words of Torah of the Torah, Prophets and Writings - or also Scripture, Mishnah and Talmud - nonetheless, my mind is not settled with this decision to fulfill one's obligation with this. As certainly Rabbi Shimon is not speaking about these, since are we dealing with evildoers that do not bless the Grace after Meals, which is a commandment from the Torah? And the words of Avot are words (teachings) of piety, as we say in the chapter [entitled] Hameniach (Bava Kamma 30), "The one wants to be pious, let him fulfill the words of Avot." And the language of Rashi [about this is] "And people are accustomed to dispensing [of this obligation] with the Grace after Meals." 
<b>"it is as if they ate from the table of the Omnipresent":</b> As it ascribes [it] to them as if they offered sacrifices in the way that the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said, "The Priests merited [to eat] from the High table" - Midrash Shmuel. And the appellation of the Holy One, blessed be He as the Omnipresent is explained in Chapter 2, Mishnah 9.

Mishnah 4

<b>"And one who turns his heart to idleness":</b> And a different text [reads] "and turns." And that is the textual variant of Rabbi Bartenura, as thus did he write, "One who stays awake, etc. and thinks, etc." And so is it written in Midrash Shmuel about the language of Rabbi Bartenura, that it [follows] the variant, "and turns." and it did not [follow] the version, "and the one that turns." And he also wrote in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed, that it is a mistake that fell into the books that have written "and one that turns"; as it does not prevent [the question from being asked] whether the one who stays awake turns [to idleness] or not. [As] if he turns, he is the same as "the one who turns" and if not, why is he is liable [for his life]? And there is no [one] who can answer [this question]. To here [are his words]. And in the name of Rashbam, he wrote, "One who stays awake" - and even at home; "and one who wanders on a road" - and even during the day; and about both of them, "alone," [because] he endangers himself, as demons will attack him. To here [are his words]. And according to his words, one can maintain the textual variant, "and one who turns." And [this is] also true with the commentary of the teacher, Rabbi Menachem in Midrash Shmuel and we should not elaborate [here]. And in Derekh Chaim, he made this textual variant, the main one. And he explained, "One who stays awake at night" is hurt, as night was only created for sleep or for study, as we say in Eruvin 55a. "And one who turns his heart" [is speaking about] even during the day. And this is to say that he is driven to idleness and seeks wastefulness. But "The One who stays awake at night" is [liable to forfeit his life] even though he does not seek wastefulness, as long as he does not sleep or learn or involve himself with his craft - 'as any Torah that is not combined with a craft will in the the end be idle.' And according to the textual variant, "and turns," one would have to force [and explain that the reason] that it does not just say "and the one who turns his heart to idleness at night," is because, if so, it would have been understood that he is turning his heart to idleness in order to sleep. To here [are his words]. And see what I have written on Mishnah 8.

Mishnah 5

<b>"The yoke of Torah":</b> Constancy of reading [it] - Rambam.
<b>"they lift from him, etc.":</b> The language of Rambam: And they said, "'Engraved (<i>charut</i>) on the tablets' [is to be understood as] freedom (<i>cheirut</i>) on the tablets." They meant to say, freedom from the circumstances of time and matters of the [government is given] to the one that does what is written on the tablets. To here [are his words]. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote in the name of Rabbi Mattatyah HaYitzhari that Rambam had the textual variant [here], "As it states (Exodus 32:16), 'engraved (<i>charut</i>) on the tablets' - read, freedom (<i>cheirut</i>). To here [are his words]. And this [statement] is found in a bereita that the sages taught.
<b>"And one who casts from himself the yoke of Torah":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "One who says, "The yolk of Torah is too hard and I cannot endure it." And it is not that the one that "is liable for his life" above (in the previous mishnah) regarding the "one who turns" is more severe than [the one] here "[upon whom] they place the yoke;" as it is certainly not. Rather, the one who "is liable for his life (literally, his soul)" that we said, is [so, only] if brigands or demons should encounter him - [then] he "is liable for his life" and his blood is required of him;  as in (Genesis 9:5), "But however I will require the blood for your souls," as Rashi explains there. But it is possible that nothing bad will occur. Here, however, "they will place the yoke, etc.," 'and he cannot escape' these yokes. [So does it] appear to me.

Mishnah 6

<b>"Ten who are sitting [together] and engaging in Torah":</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "'Ten who are sitting in judgement' is the textual variant we [follow]." And so have we found [that] ten judge in the laws of appraisals, as we learn in the beginning of Sanhedrin (Mishnah Sanhedrin 1:3); or two plus one if the [litigants] have accepted them upon themselves; or also an individual expert. See there in the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura. (And see later on.)  
<b>"And from where [is there proof that this is true] even [when there are only] five? ”:</b> And Rashbam wrote, "From where," without [a letter] <i>vav</i> (which represents the conjunction, and). And so [too] all of the "from where" that are written here are written without a <i>vav</i> in [this] mishnah - Midrash Shmuel. And it appears to me [that it is] because it is not relevant to connect a matter and to say, "and from where," unless it was already an established notion that it was so; and he was rather only seeking from where is there support from scripture. But here there is no established notion at all and he is seeking to find that the law itself is so. Therefore it is more properly relevant to teach, "from where," without a <i>vav</i>; as there is no connection to the above, but rather, it is it a [different] matter unto itself.
<b>"five? As it is said (Psalms 82:1), ''His band, etc.'”:</b> In Tosafot on Sukkah 13a:26 s.v. beshalosh shemei eged (in the first chapter), they uphold this textual variant. And see later on. (And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "when there is a band there that is involved with Torah," even though his textual variant was "who are sitting in judgement;" [is since judgement] is, all the more so, involvement with Torah, as I wrote later on, with God's help.)  
<b>"even two?'”:</b> "And since even two, do I need [to say] three? What would you say [otherwise]? Judgement is just making peace and [so] the Divine Presence does not come. [Hence] the verse comes to make us understand that judgement is also Torah [study]. And since even three, do I need [to say] ten? [With] ten, the Divine Presence comes to precede [them; with] three, [It waits] until they are seated" - Gemara: first chapter of Berakhot 6a. And it is speaking about what was stated there, and there 'five' was not stated. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote that with ten, He is upright - he means to say, He is standing - as if it were possible - and they are sitting; which  is not the case with five, as [there,] "upright" is not written.
<b>"And from where even one?'”:</b> See what I wrote on Mishnah 2 [from the] gemara (Berakhot 6a), Now [that I know], "one, do I need [to say] two?, etc."
<b>As it is said (Exodus 20:20): “In every place, etc.":</b> I already wrote earlier what appears [correct] to me about this, that here one should [follow] the textual variant, "As it is said, 'He sits alone [and is silent, since he takes (<i>natal</i>) for it]'" And that is what is found here (on this mishnah) in the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura: "since he takes (<i>natal</i>) for it” [is] an expression of covering, etc. And so [too] in the commentary of Rashi as per the testimony of the writer of Midrash Shmuel - but not as per his judgement; as he judged to [place] it in the commentary of Rashi earlier (on Mishnah 2). And [it is] as I wrote there with God's help. And even though Tosafot uphold the textual variant, "and His band with five," as I wrote above with God's help, and it is from that which is stated in the gemara [in] the first chapter of Berakhot 6a, "From where [do I know] that three, etc.? As it is said (Psalms 82:1), 'In the midst of judges He judges,'” and in that same statement itself is also found, "And from where even one? As it is said (Exodus 20:20), 'In every place, etc;'" [nonetheless] one cannot infer [otherwise], as it can be said that it says this about Mishnah 3 (Mishnah 2 in this standard edition) above. And this appears more [correct] according to the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura, as behold, he explains that our Mishnah here [follows] our variant text, "that are sitting in judgement." And, if so, [with] one [here] also, it is speaking that he is sitting in judgement, and like the commentary of Rashi earlier. And therefore that which is stated over there (in Berakhot) is regarding the matter of sitting and being involved in Torah [study] from the earlier mishnah.  And there is a small objection [to this] in the gemara there: since it is [the same as what is taught] in our mishnah, what is learned, since we [already] learned it? And if you will ask, according to the textual variant that reads here, "He sits alone and is silent," how is [this] relevant to a judge who is judging; this is not an objection. As behold, he too sits alone and is silent when he hears the claims and looks into the laws, as there is no one else with him that can judge with him. And [it is] just the opposite: it is more likely that a single judge that judges would only sit alone and be silent and look into [the case], than one who is involved in Torah [study]. As even though [the latter] is alone, it is is possible and likely that he will study out loud to himself fulfill (Proverbs 4:22), "'For they are life for those that find them' - do not read 'for those that find them,' read it as 'for those that bring out [words of Torah]'" (Eruvin 54a), which is not the case with judging which requires examination and thought. 

Mishnah 7

<b>"And thus with David it says, 'For all comes from You, etc.'":</b> About that event, when he gathered silver and gold for the Temple, did David say this verse - Rashi. And since it is possible to push this off, as maybe David is different; as he was donating to the Temple, about which God had specifically commanded (Deuteronomy 25:19 - 26:2), "And it will be when the Lord, your God, allows you to rest, etc." And also (another explanation is) it is different [with] a group. Hence, he did not say, "As it is stated, 'For all comes from You, etc.;'" as it is not a complete proof - Derekh Chaim. 
<b>Rabbi Yaakov says:</b> That is the textual variant in the book, Midrash Shmuel. And he found it written that Rabbi Yaakov is the father of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, about which they said, "His teaching is straight and clean." And so does it appear to me is the [correct] variant. As behold, the words of Rabbi Shimon were already learned above, Mishnah 3. And if it is [placed here] because it is similar to that of Rabbi Meir, "One who forgets, etc.;" it should have taught it after the words of Rabbi Meir - and all the more so, as Rabbi Meir preceded Rabbi Shimon chronologically (as you can see at the end of the fourth chapter of the Ten Chapters which are in the Introduction to Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah) - and since they are taught adjacent to one another, he should have had the words of Rabbi Meir precede; even though it is [sometimes] found [otherwise] as I wrote in Mishnah Makkot 1:7 (s.v. Rabbi Shimon). And nonetheless, one could say that since the words of Rabbi Shimon are also similar to that [which he is] before it, [in] Mishnah 4, "one who wanders on a road alone, etc.;" therefore they made it adjacent to both of them. (And it also appears to me that it is not an objection to start with, since Rabbi Dostai said it in the name or Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Meir [did] not [say it] himself; therefore, it is fine to have Rabbi Shimon precede.) 
<b>"He who is walking on the way":</b> which is a dangerous place. And some explain that it not only [on the way], but the same is true in a house. However since it is common [to find] trees and plowed fields on the way, it is [more] possible that he will interrupt.
<b>"'And how lovely is this newly plowed field'":</b> So that you not say, it is only [with] a tree that he [can] see from faraway and he says, "How lovely" which is certainly an interruption; but rather even a plowed field which is found alongside of him as he is walking, nonetheless, that [too] is [considered] an interruption - Derekh Chaim.  
<b>"Scripture considers him:"</b> In Derekh Chaim, he explained that [the teacher of the mishnah] supported this with the verse (Deuteronomy 4:9), "Only guard yourself," that is taught later on (in the next mishnah), and so [too] wrote Midrash Shmuel on the mishnah later on. But here he explained that he supported it with the verse (Job 30:4), "They reap salt-wort (<i>maluach</i>) from the leaves of the bush (<i>siach</i>)," which they expounded (Chagigah 12b) [to be] about those that interrupt words of Torah and involve themselves in conversation (<i>sicha</i>). And so is it translated [into Aramaic], "since they remove words of Torah from [the] tablet (<i>min luach</i>) of their heart, in order to take mundane words." And there is no need to mention the verse explicitly and he relies upon the one who understands, as it is not the way of a teacher of mishnah to elaborate. And it is also possible that he is expounding "bush" as a tree, as in (Genesis 2:5), "And every bush of the field," which the commentators explain [to mean] tree. And that is why he took [the expression], "How lovely is that tree." To here [are his words]. And in the commentary of Rashi it is written, "here we do not [follow the variant that] reads, 'Scripture considers him, etc.' as behold, there is no verse written [in this mishnah]. To here [are his words]. And so [too] did Rabbi Bartenura transcribe, "and it is considered, etc." Although in the mishnah later, he also transcribes the same expression, even though there it is derived from the verse, "guard, etc." And that which it is not taught here, "he is liable for his life, as it says, etc." as above in Mishnah 4, but rather we [only] learn, "considers, etc. as if, etc.," appears to me, because here it is only a chance interruption and he immediately goes back to his study; but above it is speaking about when "he turns his heart to idleness." And in Midrash Shmuel, he explains in the name of Rabbi M. Almoshnino that it is for this [reason] that it says here, "considers, etc." - to teach that Rabbi Chananya ben Chakhinai (above, Mishnah 4) is speaking about a person who has a proper time and place for meditation. To here [are his words]. And according to the second explanation of Rabbi Bartenura that here it is about one who is blessing, etc., it is not an objection to begin with. And just the opposite - that "it considers him" is a  novelty, [telling us] that the study of Torah is [greater] than all [other commandments]. 

Mishnah 8

<b>"Anyone who forgets":</b> [is coming] to include even because of laziness, and as I will explain with the help of Heaven. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote, even if it as a result of his being preoccupied in search of [sustenance] for his family, nonetheless he is liable for his life. As it is an explicit verse [that informs us of this -] (Psalms 55:23), "Cast your burden unto the Lord, etc." And the only one who is exempt is the "one [whose studies] have overpowered," etc.  
<b>"one thing":</b> As there is no such thing as "one thing" upon which many other things are not dependent. And therefore with the "one thing" that he forgot, "lest you forget the things" is fulfilled - Midrash Shmuel. And it appears to me that it is written, "guard yourself, and guard" [with the word, "guard] doubled; which is to give a guarding upon each word.  
<b>"until he sits down and [intentionally] removes them from his heart":</b> which is to say that he sits and turns his heart to idleness and, through this, removes them form his heart - and even though it is not volitional that, in this way, they be removed from his heart; since it is not written, "lest you remove them," but rather "lest they are removed," and it is [thus] implied, [even if they are removed] on their own. And so [too] was the language of the mishnah precise; as it did not teach, "One could [suppose this statement applies to] even one who did not remove them;" as it only excluded the one whose learning overpowered him. But if it automatically got removed, it is also within the prohibition of "lest they are removed." So did he explain in Derekh  Chaim. And nonetheless, one must distinguish between [the] removing of here [which is] as a result of sitting idle and between the "one who turns his heart to idleness" of before (Mishnah 4) - according to that textual variant that reads, "and one who turns;" [by which] it is an [independent] matter. And it was taught about [the latter], that he is liable for his life, whereas here it is only taught it is "as if, etc." And therefore, I say that there are three divisions in this matter:  One [type is the one] who intends to remove words of Torah from his heart. And  neither our teacher nor Rabbi Chananya ben Chakhinai is addressing such [a type]. Rather he is in the category of "anyone who casts from himself the yoke of Torah" of Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa. The second [type] is one who does not intend and seek to remove the words of Torah from his heart and to forget them, and if he would not forget them, it would be preferable to him. It is only that he wants idleness more than involvement in Torah and [so] seeks and searches out idleness. And this is the "one who turns his heart" of Rabbi Chananya ben Chakhinai, and he said that he is liable for his life. And the third [type] is that he does not want idleness more than words of Torah, but when a matter of idleness comes to his hand, he sits idly [with it] and is negligent from going back to his study because of it. And this [type] is the one of our mishnah who sits and removes them from his heart, [which means] that as a result of sitting idly, behold, the things are removed from his heart through this. So does it appear to me.

Mishnah 9

<b>"Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, etc.":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that "he makes his fear of sin precede his wisdom in his thought, etc." And with this he answers that [Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa] is not disagreeing with Hillel, who said in Mishnah 5 of the previous chapter, "A boor cannot fear sin;" as here it is talking about thought and not action. As a boor does not know what is a sin to fear from it; but in thought, one can think and fear from everything that might be a sin. And see further in Mishnah 17 (s.v. eem ein chochmah). And in Midrash Shmuel, [its author] was precise in comparing the beginning [of the mishnah] to the end. As by being precise about the beginning, it is implied that if [wisdom and fear of sin] come together [equally], his wisdom will not endure; but by being precise about the end, it is implied that if they come together, it will endure. And he answered that behold, we say (Niddah 77b) that it is decreed about [a person] whether he will be wise or foolish; and now [Rabbi Chanina] only said,"Anyone whose fear of sin, etc.," to annul that decree: If his fear of sin precedes, even if [there] is a decree that he be foolish, his wisdom will be established in his hand, as we say (in tractate Megillah 6b), to remember one's study is [with] the help of heaven. But if his "wisdom precedes, etc.," since he did not study in order to do, behold, even though the decree is that he should be wise, he is rendered foolish; and his wisdom does not endure, because of the sin that he committed - not to learn Torah for its own sake, which [means] to observe and to do. (And the decree that he be wise can be fulfilled in his other matters, but not in his Torah study - so did he write in the second section.) And if [his fear of sin and his wisdom] came together, he is left to his nature, according to the decree; that if it be that he be wise, [his wisdom] will endure, and if if be that he be foolish, it will not endure. To here [are his words]. And he wrote further that some have the textual variant, " Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom endures. And anyone whose fear of sin does not precede his wisdom, his wisdom does not endure." And in s.v. kol shechochmato, etc., he dismisses this variant.  
<b>"whose fear of sin (literally, of his sin)":</b> As "there is no righteous man in the world, who does good and does not sin." And that is why it says "whose fear of his sin" - that he fears from the sin that he is is prepared to transgress. And [so], there is no objection that it should have said, "Anyone whose fear of sin precedes, etc." - Derekh Chaim. And see the beginning of the chapter further, (in s.v.) hakovesh et yitzro.
<b>"Anyone whose actions are more plentiful than his wisdom":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "Here it speaks about  him being eager [to do] positive commandments." And one may ask, it should say, "precede," as it does with fear of sin. [To this,] Midrash Shmuel wrote in the name of Rabbenu Yonah, that there is an objection - how is it possible for his actions to be more plentiful than his wisdom, as how will he do that which he does not know? Rather, that which he accepts upon himself to do all of the things that the sages tell him and 'not to deviate to the right or to the left' - behold, this is [the meaning of] "whose actions are more plentiful than his wisdom." As from now, it is considered as if he observed the entire Torah completely, since it was in his mind to fulfill that which the sage will tell him. And so [too] is it explained in Avot DeRabbi Natan 22, as we learned there, "Anyone whose actions are more plentiful than his wisdom, as it is stated, 'we will do and we will understand' - as they preceded 'we will do' to 'we will understand' and received reward as if they had done everything before the understood [it]. And anyone whose wisdom is more plentiful than his actions - that he should not say, 'I will study a law and [then] I will fulfill it.'" To here [are its words]. And now [our original question] is answered nicely, as "more plentiful" [means] preceding in the manner of "we will do and we will understand" - and that which it did not say, "precede" is because it is impossible that the actions themselves would precede; as behold, he does not know them. But rather, it is the acceptance that he takes upon himself to them that precedes; and when he accepts, behold, he accepts everything, [which is] more than he will ever learn. And therefore we learned, "are more plentiful" - as it intended to let us understand that that which preceded was the acceptance and that the acceptance is more plentiful than the wisdom. And with this there is also no room for those that ask that there are many sages found among the nations [of the world] whose wisdom is greater than their actions - as it is mentioned in Derekh Chaim. And he answers that our mishnah is about undifferentiated people [and not exceptional sages], etc.; and he also answers that here we are only speaking about the wisdom of the Torah, etc. And for us, it is not a question to begin with; as since the [comparison] is about acceptance, it is possible that their sages 'established and accepted upon themselves' to act according to the wisdom that they would [subsequently] learn, and therefore their wisdom endures with them.
<b>"And anyone whose wisdom, etc.":</b> Some change [this] and have a textual variant that reads, "Anyone whose deeds are not, etc.." And there is no need [to explain why this is incorrect,] according to the answer that we gave above, concerning "anyone whose fear of sin, etc.," as it also relevant here. And it is easy to understand it - Midrash Shmuel. 

Mishnah 10

<b>"Anyone from whom the spirit of creations find pleasure":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[About] anyone who is beloved below, it is certain that he is beloved above." And so did Rashi explain and in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbam, as it is stated (Proverbs 3:4), "And find grace and good intellect in the eyes, etc."; and it says (Psalms 103:), "And the kindness of the Lord is for ever and ever on those that fear Him" - such that anyone who He places upon him His 'string of kindness, it is certain that he is one who fears Heaven.  
(<b>"find pleasure":</b> And with this language did we learn at the end of Tractate Sheviit: "the spirit of the sages find pleasure from him." And there I wrote the language of Rash and Rashi, who explained [that] it is like the matter of acknowledging a good (<i>hachzakat tovah</i>). And in the chapter [entitled] Hazahav (Bava Metzia 48a at the beginning), Rashi explained that there is satisfaction (<i>nachat ruach</i>) to the sages of Israel from the deeds of this one and their minds are at ease upon them. And "from him" [means] through him. To here [are his words]. And his language in the second chapter of Kiddushin 17b at the end - and he is [writing about] that from Sheviit, "the spirit of the sages does not, etc.," and he connects the two explanations together: "the mind of the spirit of the sages is not at ease upon them from his actions, that is to say, they do not acknowledge him a good, etc.," as he wrote at the end of Shevitt. And I wonder about that which Rashi explained in the chapter [entitled] Hagozel first, (Bava Kamma 94b) about accepting from penitents that the spirit of the sages does not take pleasure from them, "that there is no spirit of wisdom and piety within [such a one]." Indeed, I have seen in copies of the Mishna at the end of Sheviit that were edited there [to] " [there is] a spirit of wisdom.") 
<b>"And anyone the spirit of creations do not":</b> Both of [these statements] are needed. As if it had taught [just] the beginning, "Anyone the spirit, etc.," I would have said, "Behold, it cannot be inferred [that], 'Anyone [whom the spirit of the creatures] does not, etc;' as it is possible that the spirit of the creations do not find pleasure from him because he goes to the last extremity of piety, and nonetheless, the spirit of God finds pleasure from him." That it is why it comes to teach us [otherwise]. And if it had [only] taught the end, "Anyone whom the spirit [of the creations] does not, etc," I would have said, "Behold, it cannot be inferred that 'Anyone (who has) [from whom the spirit of creations find pleasure,] etc.,' as it is possible that the creatures find pleasure from him because he 'shows signs of purity about himself,' 'but he places his ambush within him.'" That it is why it comes to teach us [otherwise]. As it is an expert sign in both directions, whether positive or negative. And its reason is that it is written (Ezekiel 36:27), "And My spirit, I will place within you" - behold the spirit of the creatures is the spirit of God. And it is not taught, "the spirit of all the creations find pleasure, etc.," as we do not concern ourselves with a minority; as we find with Mordechai (Megillah 16b), as it says [that he was] (Esther 10:3), "accepted by most of his brothers" and not by all of his brothers, etc. - Midrash Shmuel.
<b>"midday wine":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[It] draws the heart of  a person, etc." Since in the morning, he is lazy because of sleep and in the evening he is already tired [and] wants to rest. But at midday, a person is at his greatest strength to the point that he is completely happy - Derekh Chaim.

Mishnah 11

<b>"One who profanes the Kodeshim (sacred material), etc. he has no share in the world to come":</b> And all of these are in the category of <i>apikoros</i> (a type of heretic), that we learned in the beginning of the [chapter entitled] Chelek (Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1) that he does not have a share in the world to come. So is it written in Midrash Shmuel. And in Derekh Chaim, he wrote that it is possible that these are in the category of [those that say] the Torah is not from Heaven, that we learned about there (Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1) and see later on in what is close by. And one can also say that those [mentioned] in the chapter [entitled] Chelek are even if they have all of the Torah and the commandments, they [still] do not have a share in the world to come. But those of here are if they are half meritorious and half guilty, and these five [sins mentioned] here are among the liabilities that tip the scales towards guilt. And this explanation seems [correct] to me. And see what I wrote at the end of the first chapter of Kiddushin and later at the end of Chapter 4 [here].
<b>"One who profanes the Kodeshim (sacred material), etc.":</b> In the chapter [entitled] Chelek  (Sanhedrin 99a) [it states], "The rabbis learned, 'Since he disgraced the word (<i>devar</i>) of the Lord, etc. (Numbers 15:31) - from here, Rabbi Elazar of Modi'in says, 'one who profanes the Kodeshim, etc.'" like the language of our mishnah. And Rashi explains, "profaning and disgracing is in the category of 'he disgraced the word of the Lord.'" And in the commentary of Rashi here, it is written that "one who whitens the face of another is not [mentioned] in the chapter [entitled] Chelek, and I do not know how he deduced it from Scripture." To here are [his words]. But in the textual variant in our books, [such a case] is also found in the chapter [entitled] Chelek. And in Midrash Shmuel, he explains that is in the category of "he disgraced the word of the Lord," as behold, he disgraced his fellow and there is no greater <i>apikoros</i> than this. To here [are his words]. And to me, it appears that it is in the category of "he disgraced the word (<i>devar</i>) of the Lord," as a result of man being created in the image of God; and [so] behold he is a <i>devar</i> of the Lord, meaning to say a concern (thing) of God and His image, as in (I Samuel 17:29), "is it not a matter (<i>devar</i>)." And also since, "And God said, 'let us make man'" (Genesis 1:26) is also a statement, [man is then also the word of the Lord. This means that] this [too] is [a case of] "he disgraced the word of the Lord," (as we say in Chapter Four of Rosh Hashanah 32a - and Rabbi Bartenura transcribed it in the beginning of Chapter Five [here] - "The creation is also a statement [of God], as it is written (Psalms 33:6), 'With the word of God, the heavens were created.'")                                 
<b>"one who whitens (embarrasses) the face of another in public":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "The face of one who is embarrassed turns red first, etc." And some explain that the textual variant that we [follow] in the mishnah is "one who reddens;" and so is it found in some [texts] of Rashi's commentary.
<b>"one who reveals meanings (literally, faces) in the Torah":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "For example, one who translates 'And from your seed, etc.,' and this is not the simple meaning of the text." And so did he explain in Mishnah Megillah 4:9; and there I wrote at length about this with the help of Heaven. And [about] that which Rabbi Bartenura also wrote, "And included within this is teaching wothless homiletical interpretations;" Rashi concludes, "like Menashe (Sanhedrin 99b), who would  interpret [and] ask, 'What was it to Moshe  to write (Genesis 36:12), "And Timna was the concubine?"'"
 <b>"even though he has Torah knowledge and good deeds, he has no share in the world to come":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "and he did not repent, etc., even though afflictions came to him, etc." As in the case of other sins, afflictions with death purify, and [it is] as it is written at the end of Yoma. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Ephraim that we do not [follow] the textual variant [that has] "Torah knowledge," and that this is what Rashbam wrote. 

Mishnah 12

<b>"To a youth (literally, a black one)":</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "To a young man whose hair is black," and as we learned in Mishnah Nedarim 8:3, "One who vows [to get no benefit] from black heads." And there we learn that women and children are not implied [by this term], as only men are called "black heads," but bald men and elderly men (with white hair) are included. And it is possible that it is different with vows, in which we go according to the language [common] among men; but here in the language of the sages in the mishnah, the only thing that is intended is a young man, as the one who is not young, behold, he is included in "elder." And [here] we only have two extremes: either the elder and included in it is every man of stature; or "the black one," and included in it is every man that is not of stature.
<b>"and greet (<i>mekabel</i>, literally, receive) every person with joy":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "stand with joy. 'Receive' [here] is like to receive someone, etc." And this is the language of the transcriber (translator) of Rambam: "It appears to me that the explains the word, <i>mekabel</i> [is like] <i>kabbalat panim</i> (greeting, literally, receiving of the face) and it is as if he receives someone, which is derived from (Exodus 26:5) 'the loops are <i>makbilot</i>,' which is from the Aramaic - the [Hebrew] translation [of which] is across or in front of. And so too does he say about this matter in Arabic - [about] any greeting or receiving of someone, one says, 'X met me with joy or with anger,' and with this language did [Rambam] explain it. Here it is and know it." To here are [his words]. And I do not know why they did not explain like this about what was earlier, Chapter 1, Mishnah 15, "And receive (greet) every person with a pleasant countenance."
<b>"with joy":</b> And this is more than what Shammai said, "with a pleasant countenance" - Rambam.

Mishnah 13

<b>"Joking and lightheartedness acclimate toward promiscuity":</b> The teacher, Rabbenu Yonah explained, "That is to say, 'but seriousness of mind and awe is the safeguarding fence around promiscuity'; as this whole mishnah is speaking about safeguarding fences." To here [are his words]. And that which we did not learn like this explicitly like in the other [cases] is because like this we are made to understand more: that joking and lightheartedness acclimate one to a constant habit. This would not have been the case if we had learned, "The safeguarding fence of promiscuity is seriousness of heart and awe." [As then] it would have only been implied that joking and lightheartedness bring one to promiscuity, but not that it acclimates one [to it]. So is it written in Midrash Shumuel. 
<b>"Tradition is a safeguarding fence around Torah":</b> That which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "[the intercalation of the month is binding, and dependent upon] you, even if you err without volition; you, even if you err with volition; you, even if you are mistaken," is in the gemara at the end of the second chapter of Rosh Hashanah 25a. And Rashi explained, "'Without volition' - of their own accord, [meaning] they believed it was fitting to intercalate [the month even though it was not]; 'mistaken' - as a result of false witnesses." To here [are his words]. And that about the ones with volition, so too did Tosafot transcribe it on page 22, s.v. lehataaot, etc.; but Rambam in Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month 2 at the end, transcribed "if they were under duress" [instead of "with volition."]
<b>"Tithes are a safeguarding fence around wealth":</b> In Midrash Shmuel, [it is written] that in a Jerusalemite [copy of the] mishnah, [it reads,] "Tithes are a safeguarding fence for Torah." And he explained that through this, the ones that receive the tithe were able to be strong in Torah [study]; as per [the sages'] statement, may their memory be blessed, "The Torah was only given to those that eat the priestly tithe (<i>terumah</i>)" (and I have already written on Mishnah Maasrot 1:16 [that  tithes is a] general name for all of the gifts [given to the Levites and the priests]). And the teacher, Rabbi Yisrael explained that [it is because] it is written (Deuteronomy 14:23), "And you shall eat in front of the Lord, your God, [etc.] the tithe of your grain, etc. in order that you will learn to fear the Lord, your God." To here [are his words]. 
<b>"Vows are a safeguarding fence around abstinence":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "When a person begins abstinence, etc., he should accept [it] upon himself with the language of a vow, etc." And see what I wrote at the beginning of Nedarim, s.v. kinedrei kasherim (Tosafot Yom Tov on Mishnah Nedarim 1:1:10). 
<b>"A safeguarding fence around wisdom is silence":</b> And it did not say, "Silence is a safeguarding fence around wisdom," like with the others, as changing [the word order] in the last statement is a [common] way of showing that a statement is the last. So is it written in Derekh Chaim. And in Midrash Shmuel, [its author] wrote that it is different here, since there is no safeguarding fence around wisdom besides silence alone. And that is why it taught [the word], "fence" first [here]; which is to say that the safeguarding fence of wisdom is silence, which is not the case with the others - as even though, each one is a safeguarding fence to that thing, nonetheless, there is for that thing also another fence besides it.      
<b>"silence":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained from "optional words, etc. And about them Shlomo said (Proverbs 17:28), 'A fool who is silenced is also considered a wise man.'" And since that [even] a fool who is silenced is considered wise, we understand from it that anyone who is silent, behold, he is wise. And also, as above it is written (Proverbs 17:27), "The knower of knowledge saves his speeches, the man of understanding's breath is very dear." And to it is "A fool, etc." referring to. And since the language of the mishnah is "a safeguarding fence around wisdom," it was well that Rabbi Bartenura took a verse within which was written "a wise man."  

Mishnah 14

<b>"Beloved is man, since he is created in the image [of God]. A deeper love, etc., as it says (Genesis 9:6) 'for in God's image He made man.'":</b> Rashi explained, "Beloved is man, since he is created in the image [of God]" - therefore it is incumbent upon him to do the will of his Maker. To here [are his words].  And Rabbi Akiva was speaking about all men and like the proof that he brought, which is said about the Children of Noah (the gentiles) and not the Children of Israel alone. And Rabbi Akiva wanted to give merit to all men, even to the Children of Noah. And it is an explicit statement said by Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 10, and this is his language: Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - commanded from the mouth of the Most Powerful to force all of those that come to the world to accept the commandments that the Children of Noah were commended [to keep]; and every one that does not accept [them] will be killed. And the one who does accept them is the one that is called the resident alien (<i>ger toshav</i>) in every place [where this expression is found], etc. Anyone who accepts the seven (Noahide) commandments and is careful to do them, behold, he is from the pious ones of the nations of the world and he has a share in the world to come. And this is when he accepts them and does them because the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded about them in the Torah. And Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - made us know that the Children of Noah were commanded about them from before. But if he does them because of intellectual compunction, such a one is not a resident alien and he is not from the pious ones of the world and not [it should say, "but rather"]  from their wise ones. To here are [his words]. And from here, I wonder why the commentators went far afield and did not want to go in this path to explain that the words of Rabbi Akiva that he said in his statement are towards every man, but rather only towards Israel alone. And they made their words rely upon the statement [of the sages], may their memory be blessed, "You (the Jews) are called man, etc." And behold, this is a homily upon a homily. And with this they had to go into forced understandings of the matter of the Divine image and the explanation of the verse that he brought as a proof. But in my eyes, [the first] path is a broad paved one, as [certainly] Rabbi Akiva is coming to make straight all that come into the world, as we were commanded from the mouth of Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - as per the words of Rambam. And if with the compulsion of the sword, death and destruction we were commanded, all the more so with the compulsion of words. [Hence,] he mentioned them for the good to pull their hearts to the will of their Maker and the desire of their Rock. He said that they are beloved to be created in the Divine image to place a teaching in their hearts: That this is 'the law of man'; to do the statutes of God and His laws, from the angle of His commanding them, as per the words of Rambam. As since he was beloved to be created in His image, therefore it is incumbent upon him to do the will of his Maker, as per the commentary of Rashi. And now it comes out well that he took that verse, even though there are several verses before it that state, "Let us make man in Our image;" still this verse is stated concerning the commandments that they were commanded. Therefore, he brought this verse, as God, may He be blessed, stated it as the reason for the commandment that He commanded them: "for in God's image He made man." And the verse was said to the Children of Noah and Rabbi Akiva said these words to the Children of Noah. And it also comes out well that he said, "that he is created in the image" and it is missing the referent [of the word, "image"], which is God, which is stated in the verse. However, with "children," he said that they were "children to the Omnipresent." And the reason is that this too is from the words of rebuke that he is rebuking them [with] and to say that they were created in the image - and in which image; in the image of God, as he says that the creation [of man] was in the image of God - but since they do not fulfill His commandments, and even if they do fulfill them, they do not fulfill them because He commanded them; behold they are lacking the description of [being in] the image of God. And also regarding the matter of the image itself, it is - according to the commentary of Rambam at the beginning of the Guide [for the Perplexed] - the intellectual comprehension with which man was made unique; and his [ability] to strive for the truth of something. And behold, the goal of this intellectual comprehension is the knowledge of God, according to that which is possible within the power of man and his comprehension. And therefore this perfect sage used wisdom in not saying about them, "the image of God," as they are truthfully lacking in the knowledge of God. And the verse that states he was created in the image of God is saying that they were created thus, which is to say that this was the intention of the creation of man - that he should have intellectual comprehension that reaches the knowledge of God. But since, in fact, 'they did not know and did not understand and walked in the darkness' and the intention did not come to fulfillment; it is fitting that he say that they were created in the image, and not in the image of God - since the intention, which is the comprehension of God, was not completed - and there is only the preparation [for this] in them. And that is fitting to call image without the referent, which is God. And this appears to me [to be correct] in the explanation of the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And according to this, the mishnah after this, "Everything is foreseen," is nicely precise, as I will explain there, with the help of Heaven. And also that with this too is there also a deeper love that is made known to Israel: that even though He already made them beloved, like all men, with the image of God with which He made him; nonetheless, He did not deviate from loving them with even more elevation and more might - as they are called children to the Omnipresent, and this is more elevation and eminence; and with a precious instrument which is the Torah that He gave to them, and this is the might, as it is stated (Psalms 29:11), "The Lord will give might to His people" (which they, may their memory be blessed, expounded to be about the Torah in the chapter [entitled] Parat Chatat (Zevachim 116a)).  
 <b>"as it says (Deuteronomy 14:1) 'You are children of the Lord, your God'":</b> And he did not bring the verse (Exodus 4:22), "My son, My first-born, Israel," which is first; as that verse is possible to explain as only about that generation which he wanted to bring out of Egypt; they are the ones that He loved, to bring them out of Egypt, and He called them, "My son." And from where [would] we [know] about the generations that followed? Therefore, he brought this verse, which is stated with commandments in which we were commanded for the many generations forever, '[as a] statute that is not to be transgressed' - "do not cut yourselves, etc.," which are obligations on the individual which are operative in every place and in each and every generation - and He called them "My children." So does it appear to me. And in Midrash Shmuel, he explained in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed, that for this reason did it bring this verse, because with it he informed Israel, themselves, that they are children, as it is written, "You are children, etc." And so [too] above, "in God's image He made man," he informed mankind themselves. And so [too] later with, "For a good lesson I have given to you." To here [are his words]. And this is right according to the explanation of Rambam [on] "with a deeper love - it is revealed." But according to Rabbi Bartenura - who did not make a precise inference [about] "it is revealed to them," but rather [that] "revealed," means known to all - the proof [from the verse] is not coming from the angle that it was told to them, but that it was revealed and publicized to all that come to the world; [and so] what  I explained is more correct. 
<b>"a precious instrument:"</b> It is the Torah which is called precious, as it is written (Psalms 19:8), "The law of the Lord is perfect, etc." and it is written after it (verse 11), "They are more precious than gold and than much fine gold." So did he explain in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yisrael, may his memory be blessed. And to me it appears that it is for this reason that he calls it "a precious instrument" here - because he is speaking about [how] with it He created the world; and with creation of the world, [the word,] "precious" is said, as the sages, may their memory be blessed, ordered in the blessing for Shabbat, "most precious of days did You call it." And its reason is from the Targum Yerushalmi, that translates, "and He completed," as "and He made precious;" and the intention is that the end of creation and the creation generally was precious in His eyes, may He be blessed. And therefore He said about them, "it was good." And that is [the meaning] of that which Rabbi Bartenura explained that "a good lesson" is the creation, about which it said, "it was good." And since good is applicable to physical things and precious is more associated with intellectual things, as what is precious is [felt] in the soul; therefore he did not call it "a good instrument," as was said about the creation, "it was good" - but rather, he called it "a precious instrument." And it is an explicit verse, as it is stated (Genesis 3:6), "as the tree was good to eat, etc. and precious to contemplate" - behold that good is said about physical eating and precious is said about contemplating.    

Mishnah 15

<b>"Everything is foreseen and freewill is given and with goodness the world is judged":</b> He is speaking about the whole world, both Israel and the other nations. And that is [why] he stated, "the world," and that is also [a way of saying] everyone. And for this reason it was not learned in this mishnah at the beginning, "he used to say." As this is the continuation of the statement of the previous mishnah, in which he said, "beloved is man, etc." about the nations of the world. [There he included] all of them to pull them and straighten them to the commandments that they were commanded, as I explained there with the help of Heaven. And now he is adding [this] to give [more] strength to the rebuke, and to call out in the name [of God], "Everything is foreseen, etc., and with goodness, etc.," both [for] Israel and [for] the nations of the world.
<b>"Everything is foreseen and freewill is given":</b>  Rabbi Bartenura wrote in the name of Rambam, that he explained, "'Everything is foreseen': Every action of people - that which he has done and that which he will do in the future - is revealed in front of Him. And do not say, 'Since the Holy One, blessed be He, knows what a person will do - if so, he is compelled in his actions to be righteous or evil.' As 'freewill is given' into his hand, etc." As the knowledge of God, may He be blessed, is not like our knowledge. And even though we call it knowledge like we say about our [own] knowledge, this is only [by way of] a total juxtaposition [of similar ideas under one name]. And just like we do not have the power to know the truth of His existence, may He be blessed, as it is stated (Job 11:7), "Can you find the investigation of God, or find the end of the Almighty;" so [too] do we not have the power to grasp and find His knowledge, as He and His knowledge are one, as the prophet says (Isaiah 55:8), "As my thoughts are not not your thoughts." These are the words of Rambam at the end of the Eight Chapters that he has precede this tractate, and it is repeated in his essay, Mishneh Torah, Repentance 5 and repeated a third time in his book, Guide for the Perplexed 3:20, and there he wrote at length. (And Ravaad critiqued him at the end of Chapter 5 of the Laws of Repentance, and this is his language: This writer did not follow the custom of the sages, that a man not begin with something that he does not know how to finish. And he began with questions and objections and he left the thing with its objection and brought it back to [be a matter of] [faith. And it would have been better] for him to leave the thing with the simplicity of the simple ones and not to arouse their hearts and leave their minds with a doubt. And maybe one day, a [bad] thought will come into their hearts about this. To here are [his words]. And I say that he did follow the custom of the sages, and these are the sages [of the Talmud], may their memory be blessed. (As that which he says) [They said a statement similar to this] without finishing that Raavad said about him - behold, it is a whole mishnah that we learned at the beginning of the second chapter of Mishnah Chagigah 2:1, "Anyone who looks into four things would be better off if he had not come into this world: what is above, what is below, what is before, and what is after." And I see no difference between the words of the sage, [meaning] the teacher of the mishnah, and the words of Rambam. As in that which the teacher said, "[it] would be better off if he had not come into this world," it is found that he forbids [one] to observe and research and investigate these things. And why should he do so, as with this he arouses the hearts of people - it would have been better for the teacher to be quiet, as maybe a [bad] thought will come to their mind. If so, also the words of Rambam are like this, as he informs us that one cannot grasp [it]; therefore they should not think [about it], as they cannot grasp [it]. And I say that our teacher also, when he said, "Everything is foreseen and freewill is given," his intention was to say (be concerned) [it should say, freewill-permission] freewill is in the hand of a person; but there is nothing hidden, but [rather] it is [all] revealed and known to Him, may He be blessed, to punish and reward, as this is a principle upon which the whole Torah is based - and that is freewill. And afterwards follows the knowledge, to punish and to reward. But to first make known that everything is revealed, there is [ostensibly] no reason for the thing. As what is to us to know that that He knows all things if we do not already know that freewill is given. But rather certainly, the intention of the teacher is to point out and to say that even though "Everything is foreseen, it does not contradict freewill - that, nonetheless, freewill is in the hands of man, as "freewill is given." And when he said this, behold, he pointed out the question without answering a thing; and the reason for this is that it is automatically inferred that there is no answer here, as he did not explain the answer. Nonetheless, however, it is [also] shown from his words that are stated as an expression of 'even though;' from which it already points out the matter of the contradiction that is hidden in it. I have also seen this sight and found it in Midrash Rabbah, Bereshit Rabbah 22:9, concerning the killing of Kain and Chevel and this is its language: "Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said, 'The matter is difficult to say and it is impossible for the mouth to explain it. [It is compared] to two athletes (wrestlers) who are are standing and wresting  in front of the king. If the King wanted, he would have separated them, [but] he did not want to separate them. [So] one of them overpowered his fellow and killed him. And [the victim] was yelling out and saying, "who will bring the case in front of the king?" So [too] (Genesis 4:10), "the voice of the blood of your brother is yelling out to me from the earth."'" To here are [his words]. Behold [this is] just like the words of Rambam, as he points out about the king that he could have separated them, as he knew and saw that they were wrestling; and he did not answer to say why he did not separate them. Rather, "the matter is difficult to say and impossible for the mouth to explain" and, nonetheless, the Divine sage, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai did not prevent himself from pointing out about this. And about that which Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai did not say this about the sin of Adam which was earlier, [meaning] that the Holy One, blessed be He, could have separated him; it appears to me that one can say it is because freewill is hinted to with Kain and Chevel; as they hint to the two drives upon which freewill is dependent, the drive to do good and the evil impulse, as is explained in the Guide for the Perplexed 2:30. In the final analysis, Rambam did well when he spoke and folowed the custom of the sages and the perfect ones, the divine teachers of the Mishnah, their memory should be for a blessing for the life in the world to come.) And in Midrash Shmuel, [its author] wrote, that it is not an objection to begin with, as the knowledge of God, may He be blessed, is like [one who] observes and gazes at an action that a man does. And behold, a man's seeing of someone else's action does not force that action. So [too], the observation of human action by God, may He be blessed, does not force it. And it is not relevant to say that [since] He knows what a man will do in the future, if so, the man is forced to do it; since in front of Him, may He be blessed, there is no before and after, since He is not [beholden to] the laws of time. And he wrote that Rabbi M. Almoshnino wrote that this is the opinion of Rambam himself, when he distinguished His knowledge from our knowledge in this way itself that His knowledge is always in the present and there is no future in front of Him, may He be blessed, but rather everything is in the present. And just like in our terms, knowledge of the present does not force [it], so too is His knowledge always in the present and not forcing [anything]. But the question that is [common] among the creatures is because we are not able to imagine how His knowledge can always be in the present, even that which is in the future in our terms. And so Rambam reinforced that His knowledge is not like our knowledge, and that we should not got mixed up about this. And that is also [the meaning of] that which we learned, "Everything is foreseen," in the past tense, as everything is [already] seen by Him, [and so] He does not gaze into the future. To here are his words. (And know that which Midrash Shmuel said, that the knowledge of God, may He be blessed, is like one who observes and gazes at the action that a man does, etc., is [actually] the conclusion of the words of Raavad (ibid.); who says that the knowledge of God, may He be blessed, is like the knowledge of the astrologists. However, he ends, "And all of this is not worth [anything]." And you should also know that even Raavad was preceded in this rationale by Rav Saadiah Gaon in his book, Beliefs, in the fourth essay in it; as there he wrote similarly to this matter. And we should not write at any more length about this.) And in Derekh Chaim, [its author] wrote that for this [reason] do we learn, "foreseen" and not foresee: since the bad things that He does not want are also foreseen. And [had it said] foresee, it would have implied that he is seeking to see; but by bad things, behold, it is written (Habakuk 1:13), "to gaze upon iniquity, You can not." To here [are his words].
<b>"and with goodness the world is judged":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained in the name of Rambam that this is its explanation: And since this is so that "freewill is given, ...with goodness (or properly) the world is judged," etc.  Even though this explanation is good, it is not found to be like his words in the Commentary of Rambam that is in our hands. [But rather] this is his language: "And he says that the judgement of God, may He be blessed, is truly with kindness and with goodness, not according to the judgement that befits them, as He elucidated, may He be blessed, about His ways. And He said, 'Slow to anger to the righteous and to the wicked.' And the prophet [the psalmist] said (Psalms 145:9), 'God is good to all.'" To here [are his words]. 
<b>"all is in accordance to the majority of the deed":</b> In the other explanation written by Rabbi Bartenura, "[that] according to the majority of a person's deeds is he judged," see about this [see there] the end of the first chapter of Kiddushin. And that which he writes that Rambam explains [that it is] "according to what a person repeats and is constant, etc." and that his "textual variant is, 'all is in accordance to the majority of the deed'; and not 'as per the deed,'" I do not know where he gets this, as it is not indicated. And the language of Rambam is like this: "He said that the virtues do not come to a man according to the majority of large deeds but according to the majority of the number of deeds, etc. and so [too] in the Torah, there is not reward, etc. And about such a comparison is it said, 'according to the majority of the deed,' and not 'according to the size of the deed.'" To here [are his words]. It appears that he is making a precise inference from the word, "majority," and that it did not say, "size." And in Midrash Shmuel, [about] that he also wrote that Rambam's variant was such, it is not his testimony, but rather 'a witness of [another] witness' as his words there are taken from the words of Rabbi Bartenura, even though he did not write them in his name. And I saw in Midrash Shmuel that he wrote there in the name of Rabbi Moshe Alshaker that there are some that [follow] the textual variant, "and with goodness the world is judged"; but [do] not [have] "according to the majority of the deed." And he explains that the intention is that the world is judged with goodness, grace, kindness and mercy, but not according to the majority of peoples's deeds. As were He to [consider] the majority of deeds, the world would be lost and gone. To here [are his words]. And you should know that there is, nevertheless, retribution for a man according to his deeds. As "anyone who says that the Holy One, blessed be He, is foregoing, his innards become foregone." (Bava Kamma 50a) It is just that He is slow to anger and He judges the world with goodness, so that it not be lost and gone. And He collects what is His at times that are known to Him, may His perpetual awareness be blessed. And see the end of the first chapter of Kiddushin.

Mishnah 16

<b>He would say, "Everything is given as collateral, etc.":</b> Even though this is also learned about the the whole world and continues form his first words, when he said, "Beloved is man, etc.," which he said about every person in the world, as I explained there with Heaven's help - and for this reason, he taught, "Everything is foreseen, etc.," without [introducing it with] "He would say," since there are not two [different] sayings here, but rather everything follows one from another, as I also wrote there, with Heaven's help -  and behold, this mishnah, is also speaking about all that come to the world; nevertheless, [the introduction] "He would say" is taught on it, since this mishnah is nothing but an additional explanation of the [previous] mishnah, "Everything is foreseen, etc." As he is now only coming to say a parable about "with goodness is the world judged." And so did Rabbi Batenura explain about, "and everyone who wants to borrow, etc."; that "this is [the meaning of] 'freewill is given.'" And it [nevertheless] says about it, "He would say"; which is to say that he, himself, would say the explanation of his words. [Alternatively,] this is what he was saying, "He would say [the same idea] in a different [way]. And in Midrash Shmuel in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed, [he wrote] that "Everything is given as collateral" corresponds to "Everything is foreseen"; which is to say that even though "everything is foreseen" and God, may He  be blessed, knows about those that are doing evil, he does not requite their evil immediately, as "everything is given as collateral - which is to say that he has guarantors that he will not escape from His hand. And so [too] can one explain according to the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura, "The feet of a man, they are his guarantors." 
<b>"and the collectors":</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "Afflictions and bad occurrences." And the language of Rambam - "it is a metaphor for death and other punishments, etc." - is like the language of Rabbi Bartenura on "a net is cast." 
<b>"with his knowledge or without his knowledge":</b> And in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbam, [he writes] that there are some that [follow] the textual variant, "with their knowledge or without their knowledge." And this is the main [text] as [the mishnah] refers to the collectors; and it is like that [which is found] in Chagigah 4b [in the first chapter], [wherein the angel of death is speaking to one of his deputies], "How were you able to get her, etc.?" If so, it is about a group, [and] that is the meaning of "with their knowledge or without their knowledge;" but rather through the command of the Holy One, blessed, be He. To here [are his words].
<b>"and the judgement is true judgement":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "As the Holy One, blessed be He, does not deal despotically with His creatures." (Avodah Zarah 3a) Arukh explained, [despotically means] with force and conspiracy. To here [are his words]. And in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbam, [he wrote] that in the mishnah, it is written, "and the One who judges is a true Judge;" and in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Ephraim, that there are those that [follow] the textual variant, "and the judgement is true judgement," and those that [follow] the variant, "and the One who judges is a true Judge."
<b>"and everything is prepared for the feast":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Both the righteous and the wicked, etc."; except for those learned earlier in Mishnah 11, and in the beginning of the chapter [entitled] Chelek. And see at the end of Chapter 2 of Eduyot. 

Mishnah 17

 <b>"If there is no Torah, there is no worldly occupation,  etc.":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "'his worldly occupation,' his give and take is well, etc., 'and if there is no worldly occupation,' in the end, his Torah will be forgotten from him." And the teacher of the mishnah did not come to speak about precedence or antecedence, that one needs to come before the other. As if you say that, not even one of them will (not) be in existence. As if the one cannot exist except if the other precedes it and each one is required to precede the other, it comes out that it is impossible that the later exist without the earlier and [yet] both of them are later - [hence] it comes out that both of them do not exist. And also it is certain that a worldly occupation has temporal precedence over Torah, and as I wrote in Chapter 2, Mishnah 2. But rather the intention of the teacher is that if he does not study [Torah], even though he gives and takes, he will not be good with the creatures; as he will not know [how] to act properly - like the matter [is expressed by] the sages, may their memory be blessed, in the chapter [entitled] hamaniach (Bava Kamma 30a), "that one that wants to be a pious man, let him study the words of [the Order of] Damages." And so [too], "if there is no worldly occupation," meaning to say, if he does not give and take well, etc.; in the end his Torah will be forgotten from him because of the sin that he committed - that he profaned the name of Heaven. As they will say, "[this man] who learned Torah, ...how rotten  are his deeds, etc." (Yoma 86a)
<b>"If there is no wisdom, there is no fear, etc.":</b> Rabbi Bartenura already explained earlier in Mishnah 9, in the mishnah  of "Anyone whose fear of sin does not precede his wisdom," that he needs to precede [wisdom] with the thought that he is learning in order that he should be one who fears sin. And [so] here one should explain that this is what he is saying, "If there is no wisdom," then even if his thought is to be one that fears sin, his fear will not be [true] fear, as he will not know to continue to be careful, and it is as was taught in Mishnah 5 in Chapter 2, "A boor cannot fear sin." And so [too], "if there is no fear," means [to say] in his thought. <b>"there is no wisdom;"</b> Meaning to say, his wisdom does not endure, as above, Mishnah 9. And now this section is similar to the earlier one: As in the first distinction in the previous one, what it started with - and that is the Torah - was the cause for the existence of the second - and that is a worldly occupation. And in the second distinction, what is started with - and that is a worldly occupation - is the cause for the endurance of the second - and that is the Torah. So also in this section, in the first distinction, it started with wisdom and it is the cause for the existence of the second - and that is fear. And in the second distinction, what it started with - and that is fear - is the cause for the endurance of the second - and that is wisdom. And so [too] understanding is the cause for the existence of knowledge; as if he does not understand, upon what will he place his reasoning and knowledge. And knowledge is the cause for the endurance of understanding; as if he does not know the reason of a thing, that which he understands as if if were not. And so [too] flour is the cause for the existence of Torah; as there is certainly temporal precedence for the preservation of the body before the [development] of the soul. And the Torah is the cause for the preservation of the flour; as if there is no Torah, 'he will surely be punished,' and there will not be flour, and he will be famished and die. So does it appear to me; and [also] that this textual variant is the main one. And there are books that [follow] the variant in this section [that has as] the first distinction, "If there is no fear, etc." And one should explain [that this is] because there is virtue to fear and it is more important than wisdom, since the goal of wisdom is certainly fear. But there is an objection in the fourth section, as it teaches, "If there is not flour, etc.," and it would have been fitting to begin, "If there is no Torah, etc." And in Derekh Chaim, he resolves [this, when he writes that] since it already mentioned Torah in the first section in the first distinction, "If there is no Torah, they did not want to structure it like this again. And this is also the reason why it did not place this last section [immediately] adjacent to the first section. And since [this section] is last, there is another reason that it did not begin it with, "If there is no Torah, etc."; and that is that, if so, it would conclude with Torah, and that is a disgrace to mention it last. To here are his words. And according to his approach, I say that for this reason did it not want to begin, "If there is no Torah, etc.": that, if so, the [concluding words] would be, "there is no Torah." And it is not fitting to conclude like this, because of 'do not stop upon a bad thing,' as was explained by Rabbi Bartenura at the end of Tractate Moed Katan and Tractate Yadayim.
<b>"knowledge":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, it is seeing [the] reason, etc. And, if so, that which is stated in the verse (Psalms 119:66), "Teach me good reasoning and knowledge," [is a case of] synonyms.
<b>"flour":</b> It did not say, wheat or bread, because it did not want to assure him of wheat, the way of which is to store it for many days; and also not of bread that will not suffice, as it is for [one] day or [one] week, about which it is said (Deuteronomy 28:15), "'And your life will be dependent' - this is the one who relies on the baker." (Menachot 103b) But rather [it assured something] in between them; that he should have a bit of flour and water that is ready to make bread from; and also other cooked foods made from flour - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Lev Avot. 
<b>"Anyone whose wisdom exceeds his deeds, etc.":</b> Rabbi Bartenura did not explain anything about it, because [something] similar to this was already taught in Mishnah 9. And this teacher only came to inform us of the matter with this nice metaphor. And so [too] did Rambam write in his commentary: "'whose deeds exceeds his wisdom' - we have already explained and elucidated, etc."
 <b>"but whose roots are few":</b> The deed is similar to roots, because they are the essence, as we say above (at the end of the first chapter), "And the exposition [of Torah] is not what is essential, but the action" - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rashbam.
<b>"as it is said, 'And he shall be like a lonely juniper tree in the wasteland, etc.'":</b> Above it, it is written (Jeremiah 17:5), "cursed is the man, etc." - who does not trust in God to occasion his livelihood, but rather is involved in much theft and trusts in the people who support him. <b>"He shall be like a tree planted by the waters":</b> Above it, it is written (Jeremiah 17:7), "Blessed is the man, etc." - Rashi. And it is written in Midrash Shmuel that the wind and the uprooting are explicit also in the verse. As since it is written, "a lonely juniper tree" in the singular, and "wasteland (<i>arava</i>)," which is an expression [denoting a] plain, [it is] to indicate that there are two things to its disadvantage: as since there are no trees around it and it is also in a plain which has no mountains and hills around it; there is nothing to block the wind that comes upon it, and it will strike it until it moves it from its place. And in the verse, "He shall be like a tree planted by the waters," it is [also] elucidated, as it states, "and to the river will it stretch its roots"; as this is certainly to make known that it is well rooted in the ground and all of the winds in the world will not move it. To here [are his words]. And in the commentary of Rashi, [he writes] that [there is] another version of the text, where neither "And he shall be like a lonely juniper tree" nor "He shall be like a tree planted," is written. And it is probable in my eyes that such was the textual variant of Rabbi Bartenura and Rambam. As were it not so, they should have explained [these] proofs. However, in Derekh Chaim, he writes that [the teacher of the mishnah] did not come to bring proofs from the verses, but rather [to say] that a proper man and an improper man - each of them - is compared to a tree. And he did not seek  to find a proof for the rest of the parable, but rather [this just] came to him, etc.
(<b>"by the waters":</b> So have I edited it, and one should not [follow] the textual variant, "upon the streams of water;" as the verse that our teacher brings is from the Book of Jeremiah 17:8. And the text got muddled to [create] the variant, "the streams of," from the beginning of Psalms 1:3, which is more accustomed to be in the mouth of everyone than the verse in Jeremiah, which is what the teacher of the mishnah brought - and there, the word, "streams," is not written. And the reason that he did not bring the verse in Psalms - even though King David was earlier than Yirmiyah - is [because of] the reason that he wanted to say: that even all of the winds, etc. will not move it from its place. And that is more elucidated in the verse in Jeremiah, in which it is stated, "and to the river will it stretch its roots.")

Mishnah 18

<b>Rabbi Eliezer Chisma:</b> is the textual variant that we [follow], and not like how it is written in the books, Rabbi Eliezer ben Chisma, as he himself is called Chisma. As it is found in Midrash Rabbah, Parshat Achrei Mot (Vayikra Rabbah 23), that since he did not know how to spread (<i>pores</i>) the Shema, they embarrassed him and said to him, "This one is called Rabbi?" And he went in front of Rabbi Akiva and learned, etc. They [then] said, Rabbi Eliezer has been galvanized (<i>itchasem</i>), and they called him Rabbi Eliezer Chisma. (And so is it taught in Mishnah Terumot 3:5, "Rabbi Eliezer Chisma.")
<b>"<i>Kinin</i> (bird offerings) and the beginnings of <i>Niddah</i> (menstruation)":</b> <i>Kinin</i> (bird offerings) is an entire tractate, and the beginnings of <i>Niddah</i> (menstruation) is a mishnah at the beginning of Mishnah Arakhin 2:1. (And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote that, "she is required to immerse ninety-five [times]," are the words of Beit Shammai and is a bereita in the chapter [entitled] Hamapelet, Niddah 29b, but according to Beit Hillel, it is only thirty-five. And maybe it is a scribal error in the words of Rabbi Bartenura and it needs to be thirty five [instead of ninety-five]. However, one can say that he said like the words of Beit Shammai for emphasis, as he is not coming here to make legal decisions - hence the thing was proper in his eyes, to emphasize [the idea]; and even though it is not according to the law, as they are the words of Beit Shammai. And also, behold Tosefot conclude there (Niddah 30a, s.v. shema minah) that the law is according to Rabbi Yose ben Yehuda, who said that her last immersion is sufficient. And, if so, also the words of Beit Hillel are pushed off. Therefore what I am saying that Rabbi Bartenura only intended to emphasize [the idea] is good; as, behold, even if he had taken the words of Beit Hillel, it would also have been not like the law.)
<b>"these are the body of the laws (<i>halakhot</i>)":</b> He is not coming to exclude other laws in the Torah, as behold he only excludes "astronomical calculations and <i>Gematria</i> [numerical calculations]." But rather he mentioned these because they are similar to astronomical calculations and <i>Gematria</i>, since they are [also] calculations (and see later on). So is it written in Derekh Chaim. And he wrote further that [the mishnah] took [these laws] for their novelty; as even though <i>Kinin</i> and the beginnings of <i>Niddah</i> are calculations that come about because of a doubt that arose in them, as opposed to astronomical calculations, and <i>Gematria</i>, [in which] there is no doubt about the calculations, nevertheless, they are preferable [to the other calculations mentioned here]. To here [are his words]. And in Kessef Mishneh on Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 4 at the end, he explains that this is what the misnah means to say: <i> Kinin</i> are something of little value and the subject of the beginnings of <i>Niddah</i> is an ugly thing [and] nevertheless, "these are the body of the laws," in terms of the great reward [for them]. And astronomical calculations and <i>Gematria</i>; even though their subject is something highly elevated (see later in the explanation of <i>Gematria</i> [here]), they are not essential, but rather "condiments to wisdom." And the end of his [words], I will quote later, with Heaven's help.
<b>"these (literally, these, these) are the body of the laws (<i>halakhot</i>)":</b> And similar to this, [it is found] in the end of Mishnah Chagigah 1, "these, these are the body of the Torah." And the gemara from over there explains that it means to say, these and these are the body of the Torah, as Rabbi Bartenura wrote there. And so too is it like that [here]. And since Rabbi Eliezer Chisma was a student of Rabbi Akiva and he was after the destruction [of the Temple] - as Rambam writes in Chapter 4 of the Ten Chapters in the Introduction to the Commentary on the Mishnah - and the laws of <i>Kinin</i> are only applicable at the time when the Temple exists; therefore he needed to make us understand that even they are the body of the law - even at the time when the Temple does not exist, since their study is in place of the [Temple] service, as I wrote in the second mishnah of the first chapter.
<b>"these are the body of the laws (<i>halakhot</i>)":</b> And that which we do not learn, "body of the Torah," as we learned at the end of Mishnah Chagigah 1, [is because] here he is speaking about doubts, and there is nothing about that in the written Torah, but rather in the oral <i>halakha</i> that the sages taught.
<b>"Astronomical calculations (<i>tekufot</i>)":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "the matter of the movement of constellations." And so [too] did Rashi explain. And on account of their circling the world in a circle (<i>hekef</i>), their movement is called <i>tekufah</i>. And in the commentary of Rashi it is found, "A different version: it is the matter of the size of the movement of the sun and its reversal in the square [of its movement]." To here [are his words]. As this is [the meaning] of  <i>tekufah</i> in the usage of those that calculate intercalations - when the sun reverses to go from the quarter of the sphere to another quarter; and as Rabbi Bartenura wrote in Mishnah Sanhedrin 1:2, "We intercalate because of the <i>tekufah</i>." And even though now there is no need, since there is a [calendar] for the leap years, nevertheless, in the days of Rabbi Eliezer Chisma, they were still calculating and setting [the leap years accordingly] - as until the days of Abbaye and Rava, they did not [follow the calendar], as Rambam wrote in Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month 5:3. Therefore, it is necessary to say that the words of Rabbi Eliezer ben Chisma are only about the knowledge of the movements, and not what follows from them, which is the sanctification of the month, and the intercalation of the years; as concerning that matter, certainly these and these are the body of the laws. But his words that he spoke are to people that study this [just] to know them and to be complete in their wisdom, and he said [about this], that they are only "condiments to wisdom." So does it appear to me. 
<b>"and <i>Gematria</i> [numerical calculations]":</b> The calculation of the [numerical value of the] letters. As in (Genesis 42:2), "go down (<i>redu</i>) to there," which Yaakov said, is a hint to the 214 (the numerical equivalent of the letters in the word, <i>redu</i>) years that Israel stayed in Egypt. And so [too] (Leviticus 16:3), "With this (<i>Be-zot</i>) Aharon should come," is a hint to the first Temple, which would stand for 410 (the numerical equivalent of the letters in the word, <i>be-zot</i>) years. Also Rashi explained <i>Gematria</i> [to be] the calculation of the letters and acronyms. And so [too] in Arukh: the explanation of <i>Gematria</i> is [that] in the place of [the number,] one, we write [the letter], <i>alef</i>; in the place of [the number,] one hundred, we write [the letter], <i>kof</i>. To here [are his words]. And it appears to me that it is borrowed from the Greek, which calls the wisdom of measures and mathematics thus. And our sages borrowed the word for all matters of computation. And so wrote the commentator of Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month 18:13. And I saw that this is how Derekh Chaim explained <i>Gematria</i> in our mishnah: that he meant to say, the wisdom of measures and mathematics. To here [are his words]. (As is found [in Rashi] in the chapter [entitled] klal gadol (Shabbat 75).) And if so, the words are fitting the one who said them - since Rabbi Yehoshua testified about this Rabbi Eliezer Chisma that he knew how to approximate how many drops of water there are in the seas, as is found in the third chapter of Horayot 10a. And that is [based] on the wisdom of geometry, which is preceded by measures and mathematics. And since he was complete also in all of these, it was fit that he should say this. And if it were someone else who is not complete in these wisdoms, it would not have been fitting that he should say this, as is exemplified by their statement at the beginning of Ecclesiastes, may their memory be blessed. And therefore this explanation of  <i>Gematria</i> - that it is the wisdom of measures and mathematics - is easy to accept. And see what I will write later in the name of Maggid [Mishneh]. And so [too] does this wisdom temporally precede astronomical calculations; as, without it, a man could not left his finger or his leg in the movement of the constellations of the hosts of the heavens or their tributaries.  And nonetheless, due to the importance of the wisdom of astronomical calculations and its topic, [the mishnah] taught it before <i>Gematria</i>, even though <i>Gematria</i> has temporal precedence. 
<b>"condiments to wisdom":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Just like the condiments, that [people] are accustomed to eat at the end of the meal, etc., honor etc.; so [too] do these wisdoms, etc." And if so, the explanation of "to wisdom (<i>lechochmah</i>)" is like, "of wisdom." And the language of Rashi: "Because they are only matters of wisdom (and not wisdom itself)." And the end of the language of Kessef Mishnah [cited] above: "'To wisdom' - it means to say, to the wisdom of gemara, which is fitting to call wisdom undifferentiatedly, given that its involvement is in the clarification of His commandments, may He be blessed. And [given] the greatness of the reward that is given to those that are involved in it and those that perform commandments [that come out of] it; therefore, these wisdoms are only condiments to it, as they are not essential matters like it." To here [are his words]. And I have an objection: that, if [this is] so, also at the beginning, it should have said, "these are the body of wisdom." And I found in Maggid Misneh on Mishneh Torah, Theft 8, at the beginning of the chapter that he explained, "<i>Tekufot</i> (Astronomical calculations)," which is the wisdom of calculation, as they said, "Astronomical calculations and <i>Gematria</i> are the wisdom of [sizing];" "Condiments of wisdom" - the explanation is to the wisdom of ordering [dates], which is called, 'wisdom and understanding.' To here [are his words]. And also on this explanation do I have an objection, as <i>tekufot</i> implies the movement of the constellations and their timing, and not their calculations. And [as for] his proof from [the phrase,] "calculating <i>tekufot</i>;" just the opposite, from there its a proof that the <i>tekufah</i> is not the calculation. And also one should be precise: what are condiments that come after the meal, as behold, these come before? But rather it appears that certainly according to his words the explanation of condiments is things that are accustomed to come before the meal to give appetite. And also Rabbi Bartenura explains also like this in Mishnah Berachot 6:5.  And now that we come to this [explanation], I will say that <i>tekufot</i> is the ordering itself, which is the movements of the constellations of the hosts of the heavens and their tributaries. And [the teacher of the mishnah] is saying that it, along with <i>Gematria</i>  which comes before it - they are the condiments that give appetite to the wisdom which has no [other] wisdom after it in the human condition. And that is the wisdom of Divinity. As from the knowledge of the spheres of the heavens, he will know and recognize the Creator, may He be blessed, as He is the Rider of the heavens; since from the ridden he will know the Rider. And even according to the explanation of Rashi and Rabbi Bartenura about <i>Gematria</i> - that they are the calculations of the letters - it is possible to explain that he meant that "to the wisdom," [means] to the wisdom of Divinity. And that is [because] in Sefer Yetzirah and those similar to it, they greatly use calculations of the letters and acronyms and [other letter] combinations. And, according to this, it is possible to also say that the teacher intended the two matters together by [saying,] "astronomical calculations and <i>Gematria</i>": as the astronomical calculations are the condiments to the wisdom that is attained by analysis and research; and  <i>Gematria</i> are the condiments to the wisdom of Divinity, which is passed on to us (Kabbalah). All of this is what appears [correct] to me. 

Perek 4



Mishnah 1

<b>"Who is the wise one":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "who is fitting to be lauded by his wisdom." And one can object from that which Yirmiyahu said (Jeremiah 9:24-5), "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, nor let the rich man glory in his riches; But rather let him that glory, glory in this; that he understands and knows Me." And it appears to me that it is not difficult, since our teacher [of this mishnah] reasons that that which is written, "But rather... that he understands and knows Me," is itself included in the wisdom, the might and the wealth that [the prophet] mentioned. And so did [Yirmiyahu] say, "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, etc.; but rather" in the wisdom that "understands and knows Me." And "let not the mighty man glory in his might, etc.; but rather" in the might that "understands and knows Me." And "let not the rich man glory in his riches," etc.; but rather" in the riches that "understand and know Me." And therefore he asked, "who is the wise one, etc." and so with all of them by way of a question; to say that since the verse said in an undifferentiated way, that there is a wise man that can glory, and also a mighty man and also a rich man, one should ask who is it that the verse intended. And he investigated and found that it is a wise man "who learns from all men." And Rabbi Bartenura explained that it is found that [such a one's] intention is for the sake of Heaven - and this is exactly [one that] "understands and knows Me." And the mighty man [intended] is the one "who conquers his impulse" and that is might that is for the sake of Heaven, such that he not sin in front of Him. [And] there is no greater [example] of "understands and knows Me;" as the goal of this knowledge is to [be in] fear in front of Him and keep His commandments. And the rich man [intended] is "He who is happy with his lot" and is not confused by his wealth and so turns all of his days to the service of Heaven, and this is also "understands and knows me." And therefore it is stated, "'You will be happy' in this world, and 'it will be well with you' in the world to come." And they said in the first chapter of Berakhot 8a, "He who benefits from the work of his hands is greater than the fear of Heaven, etc. And this is also from this reason, as if he is one who is God-fearing but does not suffice and is confused by his wealth, he will not be free to do the service of God, may He be blessed.
 <b>"as it says, 'I have acquired understanding from all my teachers'":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "and the end of the verse is, 'since your testimonies are my conversation' - which means to say, 'I would learn Torah from all my teachers.'" [Since the prefix represented by the Hebrew letter <i>mem</i> which has been understood here as 'from' can also be understood as 'than,' it should be understood] that it should not be explained that it means to say, that he became more learned than his teachers, as this is not a novelty. Since after a person has learned from his teacher, he becomes wise and learned in his studies and it is not a novelty that he become more learned than what his teachers taught him - Derekh Chaim. And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "'since your testimonies are my conversation' [...] 'as all of my intentions were for the sake of Heaven alone,'" is since all of my conversation is about Torah.
<b>"He who conquers his impulse":</b> The evil impulse is called 'the impulse' without differentiation on account of its coming first and governing the body by itself [before being joined by the positive impulse] - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Yosef Karo. And he also explained that it is his impulse that is particular to him and has become powerful in him more than the positive impulse has become powerful and particular in him; as the nature of man leans more to the evil impulse. And see what I have written on Mishnah 9 [in the previous chapter] about "whose fear of sin, [etc.]."
<b>"as it says, 'slowness to anger is better than a mighty person'" (but it can also be read as, 'good is slowness to anger from might'):</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that thus is the explanation of the verse, ["Good is] slowness to anger that comes from the angle of the might, etc." Since if it were not like this, but rather that the explanation of the verse was that slowness of anger is better than a mighty person, it would be difficult - why [should it be considered better]; as if it is coming from the angle of [having] a soft nature, it is not good. [So does] it appear to me.
<b>"'You will be happy' in this world":</b> as you will not be in need from [other] creatures; and "in the world to come," as since he benefits from his [own] effort, he does not come to theft, and he inherits both worlds - Rashi.

Mishnah 2

<b>"Like the difficult ones (<i>kebechamurot</i>)":</b> In other versions, [this phrase] is not included. And in versions that include it, it is due to confusion with the beginning of Chapter 2, as there we learn, "be as careful with a easy (light) commandment as with a difficult (weighty) one." And if we do include it, it needs to be "as to a difficult one" (<i>kelechamura</i>). And in a tractate Avot that came to my hands from the Land of Israel, the [phrase], "like the strict ones," is erased.
<b>"from a sin":</b> And we do not learn [here], "an easy [sin]," as we do with a commandment. As that which we learned [concerning a commandment], "easy," means that it is easy for person to do it. And all sins are easy for a  person to do and they are all enjoyable for people. Hence it is not applicable to teach, "from an easy sin" - Derekh Chaim.
<b>"and the reward for one sin is another sin":</b> Since God, may He be blessed, leaves him to his evil nature. But not that he is helped from Heaven [to do more sins], as was written by Rabbi Bartenura concerning "the reward of a commandment." As we say [Yoma 38] (Shabbat 104a), "One who comes to purify himself, he is helped [by God], one who comes to defile himself, [the way] is made open for him." And so [too] did Midrash Shmuel explain in the name of Rabbenu Yonah.

Mishnah 3



Mishnah 4

<b>"Be humble in spirit":</b> Midrash Shmuel has a textual variant [that follows this phrase with] "in front of everyone." And see Mishnah 10.
<b>"for the hope of (<i>tikvat</i>) mortal man is with the worms":</b> Rambam explained that his end is to return to the worms. And I found similar to this in Rashi on Proverbs 11:23, on the verse, "The desire of the righteous is only good, the hope of the evildoers is wrath," where he explains, "They are certain and hope for <i>Geheinnom</i>." To here [are his words]. We infer from this that since he is certain that it will be thus, it is plausible to say about it, "hope." And [the author of] Derekh Chayim wrote, "This is the reason that we do not learn, 'since your hope;' because no man hopes to be worms, but rather this is what he meant to say, 'that every mortal is projected and set to become worms.'" And he said that [the word,] mortal [has the same numerical equivalent] as man-person (<i>adam eesh</i>), from the angle of the connection of earth (<i>adamah</i>) with humanity (<i>eeshiut</i>) - meaning to say that his faculties were [embodied in] flesh - [so that] his end would be with the worms. To here [are his words]. And behold, he was not concerned about the [the fact that the numerical equivalent of] mortal [comes out to be] one more (as this number one indicates the connection between earth and humanity). And in Midrash Shmuel, it is written in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed, "This is the explanation of our mishna, 'be lowly of spirit' in front of all those who insult you, and do not answer him, 'since the hope of mortal man' that is insulting you 'is with the worms' and [so], why should you be concerned with his voice. And his words are based on the words of [the prophet], peace be upon him, Isaiah 51:7-8, 'do not fear the insult of a mortal and from their curses do not be dismayed; Since the moth will consume them like cloth, etc.'" To here [are his words]. Also written in Midrash Shmuel is "that 'the hope of' is as it is [plainly] understood; and its explanation is that the hope of mortal man and his desire and wish is not to be buried like a donkey." To here [are his words]. And I say that even though every man certainly hopes and looks forward to the burial of a man, nonetheless it is not his hope and his wish [to be] with the worms. Rather if he could be buried and not be overcome by worms, [only] then would it be good for him. And all the more so, since we have found several [people] about which they, of blessed memory, testified were not overcome by worms (Bava Batra 17a). And there is a story of significance [testifying to this as well] about Rabbi Elazar bar Shimon in the chapter [entitled] Hasokher et HaPolaim (Bava Metzia 83a). Hence I say that what brought all of the commentators, may their memory be blessed, to hesitate about the meaning of this word (<i>tikvat</i> which is normally translated as the hope of) is that they thought that its root was <i>kuf-vav-hey</i>, and it is not. Rather its root is <i>kuf-vav</i>, as per [its usage] (Isaiah 28), "a command to a command, a line (<i>kav</i>) to a line." And the second <i>tav</i> [in the word <i>tikvat</i>] is not replacing a <i>hay</i> but rather just an addition as in <i>tiferet</i> [and] <i>tilboshet</i>. And so [too] do you find [it in the verse] (Joshua 2), "the line of (<i>tikvat</i>) scarlet thread." And from this [usage], we can explain, "a line to a line" [in Isaiah] as an expression, [denoting] a measuring string (a type of yardstick), meaning to say, "a measure for a measure, with a measuring string." And from this itself, we can explain [the phrase in Proverbs above,] <i>tikvat reshayim evrah</i> - that [evildoers] are judged according to their measuring string [that measures their evil] for wrath, fury and distress. And it is from this that our teacher stated that the <i>tikvat</i> of mortal man is with the  worms, since his measuring string are the worms. So does it appear to me. [And later I saw in Bereishit Rabbah, Parshat Bereishit, "'<i>Yikvu hamayim</i>' - a measure was made for the waters. How is this? As you say (Zachariah 1:16), 'and a [measuring] line was extended over Jerusalem.'"]
<b>"Whoever desecrates the Name of Heaven secretly":</b> And you [may] ask, behold, Rabbi Bartenura explained in Mishnah Yoma 8:8 that desecration of the Name (<i>chillul Hashem</i>) is [committed by] one who sins and causes others to sin; and I wrote there, that this is one who sins and others learn from him, and so [too] did Rabbi Bartenura write in Chapter 5, Mishnah 9 later on; if so, you don't find it "secretly." And one can answer as it is written in Derkh Chaim, that that which it states, "secretly" is not to say that it is [completely] secret; just that not many know about it, etc. He also [gave another explanation]: for example, [in the case of] ten Torah scholars in a group, and one of them stole or went into the house of prostitutes and it is not known which one it was, etc. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote in the name of Rabbenu Yonah that the desecration [of the Name of Heaven] in secret that is mentioned here is when one worships idols, which is a desecration, as he does not concede to [God's] divinity; or if he swears falsely, as it is stated (Leviticus 19:12), "And you shall not swear falsely in My name, and desecrate, etc." And in the name of Rabbenu Ephraim, [he wrote] that our mishnah is about a Torah scholar who sins secretly, since had he transgressed in public, others would learn from him and it would be a desecration of the Name. To here [are his words]. [And in my eyes that is a great stretch, as behold, nonetheless, he did not do it in public and [so] there is no desecration of the Name. And also the language of our mishnah does not imply this. And accordingly it appears to me that certainly there is no desecration by anyone who does a sin secretly, and our teacher taught, "who desecrates the Name of Heaven." And if you ask, how do you find one who desecrates the Name secretly; it appears to me that it is found with a sin that it is impossible [to do] without being joined by another - for example all of the sexual prohibitions and those that are similar to them. As the woman [he is with] is either raped or if she is seduced it is because she decided on her own that there is no prohibition, since he wanted [it], and [this] is a desecration of the Name. And it is also certainly true that one who eats forbidden foods and the like by himself and no one sees him is not (causing) a desecration of the Name at all.]
<b>"There is no differentiation between intentional and unintentional":</b> The language of Rambam: You know from the verse that the one who is unintentional [also] has a sin. And because of that he needs atonement with a sacrifice, and God, may He be blessed, said about it, "and he will be forgiven from his sin which he sinned." But he is not like the one who is intentional - God forbid for the straight paths of God, may He be blessed, to equate the intentional with the unintentional in anything. Rather, the intention [of the mishnah] is that with desecration of the Name, whether it is intentional or unintentional, his punishment is in  public. If it was intentional, the punishment is [for an] intentional [sin]; if it was unintentional, the punishment is [for an] unintentional [sin]; but both of of the punishments are in public. To here [are his words.] And so [too] did Rashi explain, that unintentional and intentional were equated concerning it being in public, not regarding all of [their] punishments. And he brought a proof from that which they [would have been] liable to death for bowing down to the idol of Nevuchadnetsar, and they were not killed, as we say (Megillah 12), "They only did outwardly, etc." And Midrash Shmuel explained in the name of Rabbi Itzchak Abarbanel, that concerning the retribution that is in public it is fitting to equate the unintentional and the intentional, to teach that that which he sinned secretly - according to the level of the sin - was public in front of Him, may He be blessed, as there is nothing secret from in front of His eyes. And that is why [the mishnah] went back to [repeat] "desecration of God's name," to teach that on account of this is the unintentional like the intentional, to get retribution in public; since the desecration of the Name is a sin against Him, may He be blessed, who is always public, etc. To here [are his words]. 

Mishnah 5

<b>"One who studies Torah in order to teach will be given the opportunity, etc":</b> One should not deduce [that the mishnah means], "to teach" but not to observe - 'for to a man who has such things,' 'says the Lord, "What is it to you that you should recount my statutes?"' And see what I have written later in the name of Kessef Mishneh.
<b>"will be given the opportunity both to study and to teach":</b> which is to say that he is afforded [the opportunity] that he will study and that his plan to teach will be successful.  And [about one who] studies [only] in order to study, it is not necessary to let us know, as he will certainly be able to fulfill his good plan - that he wanted to study. But in our case, we are finding out a novelty: that if his plan is in order to teach, he is afforded [the opportunity] to learn - and even his study by himself is successful, and not a thing will be reduced, as 'the Lord gives wisdom.' So is it written in Midrash Shmuel. And in Derekh Chaim, [the author] wrote that one who studies in order to study only for himself - and for this, he does not need very much study - it is also certainly true that he will not be afforded the opportunity to do everything that he planned; rather the study of one law will be enough for him. And Kessef Mishneh on Mishneh Torah, Torah Study 3:1 explains "in order to teach:" meaning to say that the intention of his study is not for its own sake, [but] rather to become honored in his being the head of the academy (<i>rosh yeshiva</i>), as it is written in the chapter [entitled] Hakones (Bava Kamma 62), "'To love the Lord' - that you should not say, I will read [scripture], etc, I will learn [mishnah], etc. so that I will be an elder and sit in the academy." Or that his intention is to study and get payment, as one who studies a certain trade. [In these cases,] "he is afforded the opportunity to study and to teach" according to his intention but no more. But "the one who studies in order to observe" is one who studies for its own sake, etc. And this is what Rabbi Tsadok comes to let us know - [one] who studies only in order to study, it is a sin, and that is what is written, "do not make [the Torah] into a crown, etc."
<b>"to observe (guard), and to practice":</b> As even though his intention was only to practice, he is afforded the opportunity also to guard [himself] from sins, so that he should not be like one who dips [into purifying waters] and has an [impure animal] in his hand. So wrote Midrash Shmuel. And in [a text] of Mishnah Avot from the Land of Israel, [the phrase,] "to observe" is erased. And so does it appear [to be correct], since certainly included in "in order to do" is also "to guard  [oneself] from sins. Since, [God] forbid that the intention of the one who wants to practice but not guard [himself] from sins be good in the eyes of God and that he should satisfy His will, and as I wrote at the beginning of the mishnah. But [rather] the intention of "to practice" is to keep [all of the commandments] of the Torah.
<b>"Do not make [the Torah] into a crown, etc.":</b> meaning to say, not to gain honor through it and to make a livelihood though it. And both of them were necessary to teach (we would not have been able to derive one from the other) - Derekh Chaim.
<b>"and don't use it as a spade with which to dig":</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote that "payment for teaching is forbidden to take, as it is written, (Deuteronomy 4:14), 'And I did the Lord command at that time to teach you, etc.' - just like I [was taught] for free, etc." And it is written (Ibid., 4:5), "like He commanded me," meaning to say that he commanded me to study (teach) for free. For were it not [understood this way], to what is it referring - as one cannot say that it is [referring to teaching] for payment, as how could he say [about that], "like He commanded me;" and did He command him that it is insufficient not to take reward? And one also cannot say that this is what "like He commanded me" means - "'like' He commanded me, and I am not saying [the commandments] on my own,' as surely the Israelites were not doubting this, as behold, it is written (Exodus 19), "they will believe you forever." But [rather] this is certainly its meaning - "like I commanded you" to study (teach) for free - Rabbenu Nissim Nedarim 37a (Chapter 4). And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And so [too] is a judge, etc., his decisions are nullified," is as we learned in Mishnah Bekhorot 4:6. And see what I wrote over there with Heaven's help. And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote that "the Torah permitted the Torah scholar to derive [tangible] benefit, etc. that he may sell his merchandise" and that they can purchase [merchandise] at the opening of  the marketplace is because these two actions are [ones] that some merchants do for each other as a matter of honor, even without [taking] wisdom into consideration. And a Torah scholar is worthy of being [treated as well] as an honored ignoramus - Rambam. And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And also that he should be exempt from all taxes, yokes, etc." is as is found in Ezra 7:24, "[all priests, etc.,] the king's tax, the poll tax and the meal tax, etc." <b>"Like Hillel used to say:"</b> in the first chapter in Mishnah 13.
<b>"one who benefits from the words of the Torah removes his life from the world":</b> Any one who benefits in this world through the honor of the Torah, "removes his life from the world:" the explanation [of this] is, from life in the world to come - Rambam.

Mishnah 6



Mishnah 7

<b>"And a false (literally, vain) oath":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained in the second explanation, "that the teacher [of the mishnah] is calling a false oath, a vain oath, etc. As Said Rav Dimi, "said Rabbi Yochanan" - in the beginning of Chapter 3 of Shevuot 20b - "'[making an oath by saying] "I ate," or "I did not eat" is [a] vain [oath].'" And Rashi explained, "The expression, vain (<i>shav</i>), is an expression [that means] not anything, as in (Isaiah 5:18), 'with vain (birth)pangs,' and (Jeremiah 2:30), 'In vain have I smitten your children.' Here too, it came out of his mouth in vain. And its prohibition is from, 'Do not take [My name in vain].'" To here [are his words].  And I was surprised [by this explanation] as we learned in Mishnah Shevuot 3:8, "Which is a vain oath?" and we did not learn [there] the one of swearing about the past. And one could answer, that which we said over there (Ibid., 21) to the one that argues against Rav Dimi and holds that [making an oath by saying] "I ate," or "I did not eat" is [a] false [oath] (and see the beginning of Mishnah Temurah, s. v. "and absorbs, etc."); saying explicitly, "the Torah included a false oath that is similar to a vain oath: just like a vain oath is about the past" - Rashi explained, "he swore to falsify that which is known to people" - "so too is a false oath about the past included." And so too for Rav Dimi, it can be said that anything [false] in the past is included in swearing to falsify that which is known, [as in] our mishnah. And since the main expression of 'vain' is understood more as that which is known and famous, that is why [the mishna] teaches, "he swears to falsify that which is known," but the same is true of all oaths about the past - that they are included in vain [oaths]. (However, it is found explicitly in the discussion in Chapter 3 of Shevuot 21b, that [one who makes an oath by saying] "I ate," or "I did not eat," is obligated [to bring] a sacrifice. And with a [vain] oath one is exempt, as we learned there; and for this reason, it is written, "this is  a vain oath, to exclude, etc.," as I wrote there. And even though that is according to Ravin, who argues against Rav Dimi; behold we also say over there, at the beginning of page 21, according to Rav Dimi, that [for an oath of] "I ate," or "I did not eat," one is obligated [to bring] a sacrifice.) And in Midrash Shmuel [the author] wrote in the name of Rabbi Y. Ibn Shoshan and these are his words, "He chose [the expression], 'vain oath' and not 'false oath,' since even if he is obligated to make an oath according to law and the one who makes an oath swears truthfully, it is a vain oath concerning the litigant who [makes a false accusation and hence] knows the truth. And one who makes an oath on what is [already] known to a person is [making] a vain oath." Up to here [are his words] And our mishnah comes out like the one that argues against Rav Dimi and holds that an oath of "I ate" or "I did not eat" is [a] false oath, and its prohibition is from, "do not swear in my name falsely." And like him did Rambam decide in the beginning of the Laws of Oaths. And see the Commentary of Rabbi Bartenura in the next chapter, Mishna 9. 
<b>"an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit":</b> An imbecile in that he brings enmity upon himself. And wicked as he is not concerned whether [the litigant] will steal or make a vain (false) oath.  And on top of that, arrogant in spirit, as it is arrogance of spirit that brought him to this - to give legal decisions and to judge [so as] to acquire [fame] like the [fame] of one of the great ones in the land - Midrash Shmuel. 

Mishnah 8

<b>"Don't be a lone judge":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained,"Even though an expert may judge alone," as explained in the beginning of Mishna Sanhedrin 3. (And I do not know the reason for that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "But if they accepted him, etc., he can judge alone even in the way of piety." Since behold, it is nonetheless better for him  to make the judgment in a group; and also if they are three, the convicted will not know who convicted him, as he will think with each one, "Maybe his colleagues outnumbered him." And because of this [in the Yalkutei] Maharil, he explained that it is because of this that Shmuel said in the beginning of Sanhedrin, "Two that judge, their judgment is [binding], but they are called a brazen court" - which is to say that they make their faces brazen and they do not care, even though the convicted is not able to think about any one of them that he exonerated him. But [also note] the language of Tur, Hoshen Mishpat 10 at the beginning, "Since from much give and take, he will reach its depths" - to here [are his words] - and unspecified 'give and take' is not with himself but with someone else. And [so] there does not appear to be a difference between common [judges] and experts concerning this matter.)

Mishnah 9

<b>"Anyone who implements the Torah in poverty":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that he strained, etc. in order to be involved, etc. And that which we did not teach [in this mishnah], "who is involved," is because of the end, that we do not want to teach, "anyone who is not involved." As I would have [then] said [that it is] because of the haughtiness of his heart due to his wealth that he is not involved in Torah [study]. And hence, it is taught, "one who neglects Torah in wealth;" meaning to say, on account of his needing to be involved in his [assets, since] this matter causes his neglect of Torah. And so too, this is what he means to say: "One who implements the Torah in poverty" [such that] his [business] affairs do not negate his study, but [rather] he [still] fulfills his [obligation to] study - Derekh Chaim. And now that you have reached this [conclusion] that the beginning [of the mishnah is worded] in view of the end, so too [the wording of the beginning], "<i>me'oni</i> (literally, from poverty), is in view of the end; as we learn [there, literally] "from wealth; the explanation of which is as a result of wealth. And [this is the case] even though it should have taught, "<i>be'oni</i> (in poverty) with a [letter,] <i>bet</i>. [So does] it appear to me. 
<b>"his end will be to implement it in wealth":</b> and even if experience frequently shows the opposite of this, [as does] the story of Rabbi Elazar ben Padat in Tractate Taanit 25, "If you want, the world can be destroyed, etc." In Derekh Chaim, he writes that our mishnah is [dealing with] someone of average circumstance (<i>mazal</i>). And also, [the reason such a person does not always become wealthy is] so that his wealth will not cause him to neglect [his Torah study]. And so [too] in the midrash (Yalkut Mishlei 934), "Because of what do the children of the poor, etc. So that they will not get involved in other things and forget the words of Torah, as it is written (Ecclesiastes 7), 'As oppression makes the wise, silly.'" To here [are the words of the midrash]. And also, sometimes it is the consequence of sin - and afflictions cleanse. And Shlomo said about this (Proverbs 3:9), "Honor God from your holdings, etc." and he juxtaposed it to (Ibid., verse 11), "The rebuke of the Lord, my son, do not despise;" and Rabbenu Yonah, may his memory be blessed, explained the matter of juxtaposition, [saying], if when you do the good, your success does not grow, do not doubt - and "The rebuke of the Lord, my son, etc." To here [are his words].

Mishnah 10

<b>"Minimize business and engage in Torah":</b> [This is] simple, what can it teach us? And one can explain that it is coming to say that the minimization of business should be for the sake of engagement in Torah [study], and not for the sake of the effort or laziness - Derekh Chaim. And the textual variant of Rabbi Bartenura is without a [letter,] <i>bet</i> and so is it [also] edited in [the text of] Avot which is from the Land of Israel. (With the <i>bet</i>, it would read "in business", as opposed to just "business.")
<b>"before everyone":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "To learn, etc." And this is in agreement with the textual variant of Midrash Shmuel in Mishnah 4, "be lowly of spirit before everyone;" as there it is regarding the issue of pride and here it is regarding the issue of study. But Rambam explains here too as regarding pride, and that is in agreement with the textual variant of the books that do not read like [the variant of Midrash Shmuel] earlier.
<b>"And if you labor in Torah":</b> and you exerted yourself and put effort into it, "there is abundant reward, etc." As the reward is according to the proliferation of labor and effort, and not according to the proliferation of study. And therefore, it did not state, "if you learn," but [rather], "if you labor" - as everything is dependent on the labor, both for the one who expends much and for the one who expends little. [A] support for this is the mishnah (at the end of Chapter 5) that teaches, "According to the pain is the reward" - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Y. Lirma and see the end or Chapter 2.

Mishnah 11

<b>"Defender (<i>praklit</i>)":</b> In Arukh, "my intercessor friends (<i>melitsai rayai</i>" - Job 16:20) is translated (into Aramaic) as <i>praklitai chaverai</i>.
<b>"Repentance and good deeds":</b> The language of Rambam: Repentance after bad deeds or [good deeds] at the beginning of the matter. To here [are his words]. And in Midrash Shmuel, he concludes, "And it lists repentance first because of what the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 34), 'In the place that repentants stand, even the completely righteous cannot stand.'" And he also wrote in the name of the pious one, may his memory be blessed, that Rashbam follows the textual variant, 'Torah and good deeds.' As there is nothing that would not be [included] in good deeds which are the commandments - if he confesses his sin, behold, it is written in the Torah, 'and they shall confess;' and so [too] if he returns the stolen goods and so [too] if he is lashed. But in all the variants, there is 'repentance' [and not 'Torah']. And it appears to me that repentance [here means] regret and submission, as they are the essence of repentance. And confession without submission is nothing; and this is [the meaning of] (Leviticus 26:40-1), 'And they shall confess their (sins) iniquity' without regret. And that is [why] it states, 'in their rebellion, etc. and I will bring, etc.' until, '[then] will their [uncircumcised] heart be humbled and then will their iniquity be atoned;' and their repentance will be complete." To here [are his words]. And see what more I will write later, with the help of Heaven.
<b>"like a <i>tris</i>":</b> A shield. Since the [Aramaic] translation  of (II Kings 19:32) "he shall not advance a shield upon it," is <i>vela yikadmenah bitrisin</i>. And some explain that it is [related to] "<i>trisei chanuiot</i>, the explanation [of which] is a shutter. And both explanations are in Arukh.
<b>"against punishment":</b> And one should not object [to this] from what comes at the last chapter of Yoma 86 - [As Rabbi Bartenura wrote there on Mishna 8,] "Repentance [and Yom Kippur] suspends and afflictions cleanse" - as the intention here in its stating, "like a shield" is [the same] as what they intended when they said 'suspend,' which is that people should not be disposed of and wasted completely, as the afflictions come in a way that their iniquity will be atoned and they will return to their previous virtue, according to the deliberation of the Power of knowledge. And the general principle here is that it will be like a <i>tris</i> and a shield that he should not go to waste - Midrash Shmuel in the name o f Rabbi Y. Abarbanel. And it appears to me that "punishment" here is not [referring to] punishment that comes from sin, but rather 'misfortunes and bad occurrences that rage and come' according to the custom of the world. And know that this is the case. As if you don't say this, "good deeds" that Rambam explained [as being] at the beginning of the matter - meaning to say, that [this person] did not sin - if so, what does he have to shield; since he did not sin and he has no chastisement and punishment [coming to him]. But rather "punishment" [here] is the events and bad occurrences that happen in the world. And Derekh Chaim wrote, "Since we hold that there are afflictions without sins, as is found in the chapter entitled Bemah Behama (Shabbat 55). And even [according to the opinion that holds] that there are no afflictions without sin, it need not be a big sin, but just any sin at all - as is proven in the first chapter of Berakhot 5, that for a small thing, afflictions come. And for this is repentance like a shield." To here [are his words]. (And it was necessary for him to explain, "And even [according to the opinion that holds] that there are no afflictions, etc." Since according to what is found there [regarding] that there {are} (are not) afflictions without sin; one can say that just like there {is} (is not) death without transgression, about which Rav Ami who holds there {is not} (is) death without transgression is refuted and his notion does not exist, so too his notion that there {are not} (are) afflictions without sin does not exist, etc. But according to the truth, it is possible that this is not uncontestable and it could be that the truth is like Rav Ashi [in his position] that there [are] {are not} afflictions, etc., as he was not refuted in this. And this is the language of Tosafot there: And we hear from this that there is death without transgression and there are afflictions without sin - and even though about that which he says there are not afflictions without sin, he is not refuted. To here are his words.)
<b>"its end is to endure":</b> Rashi explained that in the future its counsel will endure and be successful. To here [are his words]. And in Midrash Shmuel [the author] explains it about the gathering itself. And that which we learn, "its end" is to say that even though you will see the poverty of the assembly at the beginning, its end is to endure. And the gathering <b>"that is not for the sake of Heaven;"</b> even though you see they are successful, their end is not to endure. And it is not difficult [on account of] "An association of idols is Ephraim - let him alone" (Hoshea 4:17); as behold, their end was not to endure.
<b>"that is not for the sake of Heaven":</b> Even though the gathering is for a matter of a commandment, so long as there is a disqualifying thought [involved], like arrogance and pride - which is something common with those that deal with the public - it is [considered] not for the sake of Heaven. And that is why it does not teach, "and the one that is for the matter of a sin" - Midrash Shmuel. 

Mishnah 12

<b>"Let the honor of your student be beloved to you as your own":</b> In Midrash Shmuel in the name of the teacher, Rabbi Menachem of the House of Meir (Meiri), [he writes] that we follow the textual variant, "as the honor of your fellow." And so [too] did Rabbi M. Almosnino write in the name of Rashi, may his memory be blessed, that we follow the textual variant, "as of your fellow;" and that it is the correct version. And in Derekh Chaim, he agreed to the version of the [other] books; as [with] the honor of his fellow, it is not known if it is beloved to him, and [so] how can we make [the] honor [of his student] depend on it? And see Mishnah Avot 2:10.
<b>"and the honor of your fellow like the reverence of your teacher":</b> As we say at the end of the chapter [entitled] Elu Metziot (Bava Metzia 33), "The Torah scholars in Babylonia stand up for each other and tear [in mourning] for each other and eulogize one another." And Rashi explained, "It is like the law of a student towards his teacher, as they would sit together in the study hall and ask and answer each other and learn one from the other" - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Y. Abarbanel, may his memory be blessed. Also there in the name of the commentators - not that he equates them completely; as, if so, everything is equal. But rather [only] concerning the matter of love does he equate them; which is to say that he should be beloved to him in  the way he naturally loves - and it is beloved in his eyes to honor or to revere - one who is on a higher level than he. And the word "beloved" relates to all of them.  
<b>"and the honor of your fellow like the reverence of your teacher":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "As Aharon said to Moshe (Numbers 12:11), "my apologies to my master," etc. and he called him, "my master." And so is it found at the end of Chapter 26 in Avot deRabbe Natan and so did Rashi cite in the end of Parshat Beshalach. And behold, that which he did not take the earlier verse (Exodus 32:22), "let not the anger of my master wax" in Parshat Ki Tissa, is since there it is possible to push it off [and say] that he called him, "my master" because he was afraid of the anger and the fury. But "my apologies, my master" he did not say for himself, but rather for his sister - and [so] what is it to him to call him, "my master" [here]. We learn from this that the honor of his fellow should be like the reverence of his teacher.  And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And his brother was older than him in years" - and so is it found there - is meaning to say that even though Moshe was his teacher, behold also to Aharon there is a greater status, as he was his older brother. And we expound in the chapter [entitled] Hanoseh, (Ketuvot 103), "'[Honor your father] and <i>et</i> your mother' - [the word  <i>et</i> comes] to include your big brother." And hence according to the law, they were even and treated like fellows and, nonetheless, he called him, "my master." And it appears to me that all of this is by way of homiletics and just an <i>asmakhta</i> (an idea superimposed on a verse, and not derived from it) and a teaching of the pious. And for this reason it is asked to us in the first chapter of Kiddushin 33, "If it is his son and he is his teacher, who should stand up for who," and it is not resolved. And if [our mishnah were more than homiletical], it should have resolved it from our mishnah here. And all the more so for Rambam - who decides in Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Mamrim 6 that a father does not stand up for his son who is his teacher - you could object from our mishnah here that obligates the big one to show honor and reverence to his little brother who is his teacher. And it is possible that honoring a father is different, as it is written explicitly; which is not the case with a big brother, which comes from an [interpretive] inclusion. And it is also true that Rambam called [the status of this law] "from the words of the scribes (<i>divrei sofrim</i>)." And this is according to his way, that all that is derived through expounding he calls "from the words of the scribes." And it is as I have written in the beginning of Tractate Eruvin.

Mishnah 13

<b>"Be careful in study":</b> In Midrash Shmuel, he writes in the name of Ritva that there are some that have the textual variant, "with his student." And the intention is that he should be careful to teach his student properly, for an error of the student in a legal decision is considered an intentional transgression for the teacher that teaches him. 
(<b>"but the crown of a good name, etc.":</b> And that which Rabbi Bartneura wrote, "we say in Yoma 71b" at the top in the chapter [entitled] Ba Lo, is from a story about a high priest who came out of the Temple and everyone went behind him. And when they saw Shemaya and Avtalyon they left (the high priest) [in the gemara - him] and went after Shemaya and Avtalyon. [In the end],  Shemaya and Avtalyon came to take leave of the high priest and he said to them,  "Let the children of the nations come in peace" - disparagingly, since they were descended from Sancheriv, as was explained by Rabbi Bartenura in the first chapter, Mishna 10. And they answered him, "Let come, etc. who are not doing, etc." And Rashi explained that he abused them with verbal abuse - and the master said, "do not abuse, etc." as we learned in Mishnah Bava Metzia 4:10.)

Mishnah 14

<b>"That your colleagues will make it yours":</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "And do not rely upon your colleagues, etc." And it is all one [sentence] - that you should not depend on your colleagues and say, etc. And there are books that have the textual variant, "and that your colleagues" with a [letter] <i>vav</i> (which means and), as is written in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Y. Abarbanel, may his memory be blessed.

Mishnah 15

<b>"The tranquility of the wicked":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[it] is not known to us, why the way of the wicked is successful and for what reason the righteous, etc." [It is in the format of] teaching, not only this [which is more obvious] but also this [which is less so]: It is not necessary [to mention] the tranquility of the wicked which is not understood to us, as we know that he is wicked and see that it is well for him; but even the afflictions of the righteous, as it is possible that he appears to be righteous but he is not - and that is why it teaches, "or even" - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the commentators. And according to the second explanation that Rabbi Bartenura wrote, the reason that it teaches, "or even" is that it is an obvious thing that we do not have tranquility in our hands, we the tired ones of the exile. And if you will ask, according to the second explanation that Rabbi Bartenura wrote, what is Rabbi Yanai teaching us and why did he say it; Midrash Shmuel wrote in the name of Rabbenu Ephriam and Ramah, may their memories be a blessing, [that] it is to say that we should not despair to think of ourselves as completely wicked and that our hope is lost, God forbid. And also that we are not righteous, that we have already perfected that which is upon us to perfect in Torah [study] and [the performance of] the commandments. 
<b>"and be a tail to lions":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "[meaning] to those greater than you, etc.," as they will benefit him. And so [too] did Rambam explain. And in Midrash Shmuel, he wrote in the name of Rabbi Menachem from the House of Meir (Meiri), that we have the textual variant, "as it is stated (Proverbs 13: 20), 'One who walks with (<i>et</i>) the wise will be wizened and one who befriends (<i>roeh</i>) the fools will be broken (<i>yeroah</i>).'" And even though Rabbenu Yonah does not have this variant of the mishnah, he brings [this verse] as a proof, and explains that the word, "with (<i>et</i>)", is to teach that he is subordinate to [the wise]. And <i>roeh</i> (which can also mean to shepherd) the fools, [meaning] that he is made into the master over them, as the shepherd is the head.     
<b>"and do not be a head to foxes":</b> One should be precise [here]: It is fine [with regards to] lions - he is the most honored and rules over all of the animals and his strength and courage are great - it is justified to make a metaphor to the great ones, men of fame, the ones of great strength that carry the yoke of Torah; but [with regards to] foxes - that certainly have lesser animals than them - why did he choose to make a metaphor with them? And in Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Y. Lirma, [it is written] that one should not be negligent from learning wisdom until [the only way he can win an argument is] with tricks and machinations - for example that you will joke and make fun of your colleague and through this, his claims will be stopped; and similar to this. And you will be similar to foxes that defeat other animals and beasts with tricks [due to] the paucity of their strength. And it appears to me that it means to say that he should "not be like the heads of foxes," when he has not yet reached [the level] to make legal decisions, about whom it is stated (Proverbs 7:26), "she has felled many corpses." And they are compared to foxes, because when these want to sit in the seat of judgment and that the people will accept their decisions, they will [resort] to tricks and machinations to fool the people. And that is why it said, "a head to foxes," meaning to say even if you see that many are giving legal decisions [that are not on a level to do so] and you are the head and more important than them, do not be jealous of these sinners. And about them I interpret that which King Shlomo, peace be upon him, said (Song of Songs 7:15), "Take for us the foxes, the small foxes that destroy the vineyards" that it is the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts - and that is the gathering of sages, as we learned, "the vineyard in Yavneh," as it is written in Mishnah Eduyot 2:4. And then I found in Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Torah Study 5, that when he cited their statement, may their memory be blessed, about "'she has felled many corpses' - this is a student who has not reached [the level] to make legal decisions, but makes such decisions;" he concluded, "About them said Shlomo in his wisdom, "Take for us the foxes, the small foxes that destroy the vineyards" - the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts." And it gave me pleasure that I had the same intention as such a great one as he. 

Mishnah 16



Mishnah 17

<b>"One hour of repentance and good deeds in this world is better than all the time in the world to come":</b> The beginning is not a [contradiction] to the end, as this world is for action and the world to come is for payment and enjoyment - Midrash Shmuel in the name of the teacher, Rabbenu Yonah. 
<b>"of repentance and good deeds":</b> See what I wrote in Mishnah 11.
<b>"the world to come":</b> Rabbi Y. Abarbanel, may his memory be blessed, wrote that one can explain [it] as the world of souls and one can [also] explain [it] as the world of the revival [of the dead]. And "the world to come," that we learned at the beginning of the chapter [entitled] Chelek (Mishnah Sanhedrin 10), Rabbi Bartenura explained as the world of the revival, see there. And so [too] explained Derekh Chaim. See there in the earlier mishnah.
<b>"pleasure (<i>korat ruach</i>, literally, cooling of spirit)":</b> It is an expression [related to the usage], his mind cooled off (<i>nitkarara daato</i>), as his mind cools off and becomes composed due to happiness - Rashi. 

Mishnah 18

<b>When his deceased lies before him":</b> In Midrash Shmuel, he writes in the name of Rashbats that we follow the textual variant, "do not console him at the time of his mourning." And that those who follow the variant, "at the time when his deceased lies before him," changed the text because we find that after the burial of the dead, they would make several rows and console the mourner - as is mentioned in the chapter [entitled], Haya Koreh (Berakhot 16b). But it appears that the text should not be changed because of this, as it does not say "in the days of his mourning" or "at the time that he mourns," but rather "at the time of his mourning;" meaning to say at the time that he is wailing in his grief. To here [are his words]. (And it appears to me that one can still object from that which they make several rows. As if [Midrash Shmuel is correct], if [the mourner] wails then, they should not console him - and we have not found that the rabbis, may their memory be blessed, say this.)

Mishnah 19

<b>Shmuel the Younger (literally the Small):</b> In Midrash Shmuel in the name of the [Talmud] Yerushalmi, [he writes] that it is because he would diminish himself. And also (another explanation is) that he was (slightly) smaller than Shmuel the prophet, as [Shmuel the Younger] also prophesied at the time of his death. And he was fitting that [God's] presence should dwell upon him (Sotah 48b) but the generation was not fit for it. And it comes out that this name is praise and glory for him.
 (<b>"'your enemy (<i>oyivecha</i>)'":</b> The reading [of the text] is thus - the [letter,] <i>yod</i> is with a <i>hirik</i> [vocalization] and the [letter,] <i>bet</i> is with a <i>sheva</i> [vocalization] but the written text is "your enemies (<i>oyeveecha</i>)." 
<b>"'and when he stumbles'":</b> The [letter,] <i>bet</i> is with a <i>hirik</i> [vocalization] that is fitting [in place of] a missing [letter,] hay.)  
<b>"'and He turn from him [the enemy] His anger'":</b> In the words of Rambam, it appears that his textual variant also has, "'burning anger' is not stated, but rather 'anger' - [this] teaches that he is forgiven for all of his sins." This version is also brought in the commentary of Rashi. And Midrash Shmuel explained in the name of Rabbi Matityahu HaYitzhari, "'burning anger' is not stated - which is only the heat of anger - but rather 'anger,' meaning to say, 'all of his anger.'" And this variant appears [correct] in my eyes, since now Shmuel the Younger is adding for us a precise teaching on this verse.

Mishnah 20

<b>"One who learns as a child":</b> The language of Rambam: He said that the study in the days of youth, etc. To here [are his words]. And if so, its explanation is [that] the one who learns when he is a child. And so [too], can it be explained, is the opinion of Rabbi Bartenura. And it comes out well that it doesn't teach, "It is compared to one who writes with ink, etc." And there are those that have the textual variant, "One who teaches a child, etc." as was written in Midrash Shmuel. And he wrote that also the variant without [the letter] <i>lamed</i> ("learns as a child") can be explained like this. And so too is it explained in Derekh Chaim. And he wrote that it is not an objection [as to] why it did not teach, "is compared to one who writes;" because a teacher is not compared to a writer, as he does not inscribe the words into the memory of the student. But [rather] he is like one who shows [someone else] a shape on a wall. Behold, [even though] that picture is engraved [in the latter's] mind, we cannot say that on account of that, that the one that showed it to him engraved it in his memory. To here [are his words]. 
<b>"scraped parchment:"</b> As many calculations from matters of the world are already engraved in his mind. And when he wants to remember words of Torah [that are new to him], he will need to erase those calculations and he cannot do this completely. And that is why we do not learn, "old," which is the opposite of new - Rabbi Y. Abarbanel in Midrash Shmuel. 
<b>"to one who eats unripe grapes and drinks wine from its press:"</b> [With] the eating of grapes that are not ripe, their inferiority will already be felt when they are between his teeth; and this is what Rabbi Bartenura explained, "So [too], the wisdom of the child, etc. and [so] his words are not accepted, etc." But the drinking of wine from the press is good for him while he is drinking it, since it is pleasant to the palate, but [when it reaches] the chambers of his stomach, he will be filled with pains; and this is what Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "So [too], the wisdom of the child has a mixture of questions in it," and the mixture does not appear to be felt at the beginning of the inquiry. So does it appear to me. And most commentators explained that the grapes [correspond to] the literal part of the Torah and that the wine [corresponds to] the hidden part of the Torah; and so [too] did they say (Sanhedrin 38a), [the letters in the word,] wine has the numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of [the word,] secret.

Mishnah 21

<b>"Envy, lust and honor drive a man from the world":</b> This is in the style of the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua in Mishnah 11 of Chapter 2, "The evil eye, the evil impulse and the hate of the creatures drive, etc.," since envy is engendered by the evil eye and lust is engendered by the evil impulse and honor is the cause of hate of the creatures, as there is nothing more hateful to the creatures than the one that runs after honor. As even though they will honor him to his face and they will not rebuke him to his ears - in his presence - behold, inside of them they will place their ambush, and they will whisper together against him and hate him. And in Midrash Shmuel, he writes that from honor is engendered that he will hate the creatures, and he will not want their association when they do not honor him properly, according to [the] honor that he thinks [is coming to him]. 
<b>"drive a man from the world":</b> In part, Rashi explained, the envy that Korach envied Moshe and Aharon and the lust that Gechazi lusted to acquire money from Naaman. And the honor is from Yerovam, as it is stated (I Kings 12:27), "If this people go up to... Jerusalem," because the king [his rival] would [publicly] read <i>Misneh Torah</i> (Deuteronomy).

Mishnah 22

<b>"Those that are born will die":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained [that] they will die in the future, and [this is like] the approach that I wrote in the beginning of Chapter 3 on "to where you are going." <b>"and those that are dead will be revived:"</b> And it does not say, "to live," but rather "to be revived," as they need [it to be done to them] and they are not designed for it. Because nature does not necessitate revival after death like it necessitates death to all that live.
<b>"and the living will be judged":</b> And the textual variant of Rabbi Bartenura is "and the living will judge." And it refers to the living after death.
<b>"He is the Judge, He is the Witness, He is the Litigant":</b> He took [these items] by way of 'not only this, but also that' (going in the order of what is least obvious to what is most obvious). But according to the time order, the litigant comes first to prosecute, and afterwards he brings his witnesses, and afterwards [still] the judge judges. 
<b>"no respect of persons":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "Even for the completely righteous." Just like our teacher, Moshe, peace be upon him, was punished for the sin of anger; and [there was] payment of the evil Esav for honoring his father and mother, and of Nevuchadnetsar for the honor of God, as is explained in the gemara, Sanhedrin 96 - Rambam.
<b>"no taking of bribes":</b> Rambam explained that he does not take the bribe of [the fulfillment of] a commandment for the sin, etc. That if it is [to be understood] as to pervert justice, this is from the foolishness that is distant from God, may He be blessed, which cannot be pictured and not even be imagined; as how can [actual] bribery to Him be pictured and what would be the bribe? To here are his words. And the commentaries asked on him, what is [the explanation given in the mishnah,] "for all is His," as [this is] not a reason [that fits with] the bribe of [the fulfillment of] a commandment [as was understood to be the bribe according to Rambam]. And in Midrash Shmuel, he answered that even with a commandment, it is all His; since one who wants to purify himself is helped [by God] (Yoma 58b, Shabbat 104a), and a commandment is only known by (given credit to) the one who finishes it. To here [are his words.] And see that which I have written at the end of of the first chapter of Kiddushin. And one should not object based on the matter of repentance which He accepts; as it is not an independent commandment, but rather it corresponds to sin to push it away from one. And see also what Rabbi Bartenura wrote on Mishnah Yoma 8:8 (s. v. on a positive commandment). 
<b>"taking (<i>mikach</i>)":</b> Midrash Shmuel wrote in the name of Rabbenu Ephraim that the [letter] <i>mem</i> is with a <i>hirik</i> [vocalization] (<i>mikach</i>) and there are those that have the variant with a <i>patach</i> (<i>makach</i>), and this one and that one are not garbled. As the language of the Torah is [one way] and the language of the sages is [another way]. To here [are his words]. He means to say that it is found with a <i>hirik</i> in the Scriptures - in II Chronicles 19:7, "as with the Lord, there is no iniquity or respect of persons or taking (<i>mikach</i>) of bribes." And I say that it is not necessary to say the language of the sages is [another way], because even though the word <i>makach</i> itself is not found in a verse with a <i>patach</i>, nonetheless there is found similar to it in I Kings 6:7, "a full stone prepared (<i>masa</i>)," and so in Proverbs 18:16, "The gift (<i>matan</i>) of a man makes room for him." But with a <i>segol</i> (<i>mekach</i>), it is not found; not it and not something similar to it. And that is since the <i>mem</i> is [not part of the root] and [the first letter] of the verb is missing, and therefore the second letter [of the word] is emphasized, and hence it is only permitted to read it with a <i>patach</i> and not with a <i>segol</i>. 
<b>"that the netherworld (<i>shaol</i>)":</b> Its explanation - grave.
<b>"and against your will you were born, etc.":</b> And he chose this, since he mentioned natural things about which there is no choice for man, [and] about which they, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 33b), "Everything is in the hands of the Heavens except for the fear of the Heavens." And he did not say, "against your will, you sin or transgress or go or stand, or that which is similar to it;" as all of them are matters that are in man's power and there is no compulsion in them - Rambam. "And against your will you were born" - Rabbi Bartenura explained that "at the time of birth, [the baby] does not want to go out." Because [before then] it looks down from [one] end of the world to the [other] end, as it is written (Job 29:3), "When He shined his candle above my head" - Rashi.

Perek 5



Mishnah 1

<b>With ten utterances the world was created. And what is learned - couldn't it have been created by one utterance? Rather, [it was done this way] in order to punish, etc:</b> And this is its explanation: and what is learned from this that it was created in ten utterances, which is to say, "What lesson comes out from this?" And it is not a question on the creation itself - why was it ten utterances. But rather it means to say that there is a nice ethical teaching that we can learn from the creation being in ten utterances, as could He have not created it in one utterance? And it comes out to us from that which He created it in ten, that it is to punish, etc. But it is not that the intention of creation in ten utterances was for this - to punish, etc. - as this is not from His trait of goodness, may He be blessed, to do an extra act in order to punish, etc. So did he explain in Derekh Chaim.
<b>the world was created, etc. couldn't it have been created, etc.:</b> And we do not learn, "He created the world...and He could have created." And it appears in my eyes that he expressed through this the teaching that the creation was ex nihilo, from total nothingness, and not like the thought of the one that thinks there was primordial matter.  As if we believe in total nothingness, this statement is justified in saying that it could have been created - which is [referring to] that which was created - [in one utterance,] as since it was total nothingness and void, there was nothing preventing it from being  created in one or in ten utterances. But if there had been primordial matter, he would not be justified in simply saying that it could have been created [in one utterance, with reference to] the matter, lest the nature of that matter not [be able to] follow the creation through [only] one utterance.  
<b>and to give reward</b> That which it [uses] an expression of giving with [regards to] reward is explained at the beginning of Chapter 2. 

Mishnah 2

<b>There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, etc.:</b> which is to say that this thing that there were ten generation, it is informing us how patient God is, may He be blessed - Derekh Chaim.
<b>To demonstrate the great extent of [God's] patience, etc.:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "You too should not be surprised, etc." As so [too] was the flood 1,656 years from the creation of the world; and the destruction of the Temple was 3,828 from the creation of the world - go and calculate [it] - wait for him (the messiah), as he will not tarry. And Midrash Shmuel explained in the name of the teacher, Rabbenu Yonah, that he is making known that just like in the end, He paid them their dues - as He brought the flood upon them - so [too], behold, days will still come [when] He will pay them according to their actions and save us and redeem us quickly in our days, amen.
<b>There were ten generations from Noah to Abraham:</b> [This is] not similar to "from Adam to Noah," since Adam and Noah are included in [those] ten. But here, Noah is not included; but rather since it ended with Noah [in the first group], it went back and started [the second group] with him. 
<b>to demonstrate the extent of [God's] patience, etc.:</b> And with this he demonstrates something greater than the previous: that the Holy One, blessed be He, is patient and does not collect what is His with destruction and complete extermination, as [He did] in the generation of the flood. And it appears to me that this is [the reason] that it is written, <i>erekh apayim</i> (patient, literally, of long angers) and not <i>erekh af</i> (of long anger), as there are two angers: one that is actualized and, in the end, destroys everything; and one that is not actualized into rapid and overwhelming extermination, as a righteous one controls [it] with the fear of God.

Mishnah 3

<b>Abraham, our father:</b> Since we merit and receive good in the merit of this one who withstood all of his tests, therefore the teacher [of this mishnah] called him "our father" here. [So does it] appear to me.
<b>and he withstood them all:</b> as he did not [question] His [actions].
<b>in order to show how great his love was, etc.:</b> As with this, we certainly know how great his love was, etc. And it is like Rashi wrote in his Commentary on the Torah, (Genesis 22:12), "Now I will know [how] to answer the Satan and the nations that wonder what My love is towards you. I have, etc."

Mishnah 4

<b>Ten miracles were performed for our ancestors in Egypt:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that "they were spared from the ten plagues." And these are miracles without a doubt. And the language of the Torah in each and every one of the plagues is that the Holy One, blessed be He, brought it on the Egyptians; except for the plague of the lice, where it did not elucidate this, but it is known that He did not punish Israel. Yet they were present among [the Egyptians] and [the plagues] did not trouble them. And so did the sages elucidate - Rambam.
<b>And ten [miracles were performed] at the [Reed] Sea:</b> In the fifth miracle, about which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "that the water that congealed became [many] small pieces, similar to bricks, etc.;" (and thus did Rambam [also] explain;) one should be precise [to know] for what cause and reason did it become like bricks. (And it appears to me that it was for beauty and for the glory of Israel, like the second miracle, when the sea turned into a type of tent. And without a tent it would have also sufficed for them, by it splitting alone. And if it was to cover over them because of the sun or because of the rain, behold the clouds of glory did not move from them even when they walked through the sea, without a doubt. Rather, these two miracles were done for Israel only for their honor.)
<b>Ten plagues, etc.:</b> This is the textual variant [followed] by other books and this is the variant of Rabbi Bartenura. (And that which he wrote,  "<i>Detsakh</i> [the Hebrew initials of the first three plagues], <i>Adash</i> [the Hebrew initials of the second three plagues], <i>Beachav</i> [the Hebrew initials of the last four plagues]," as so was Rabbi Yehuda accustomed to giving [the plagues] mnemonics, as is found in the Pesach Haggadah, Magid, the Ten Plagues. And this year on Shabbat Hagadol (the Shabbat before Peasach), here in Krakow in front of the congreataion, in the sermon that I preached in the synagougue, I objected that there is no meaning to these words. And therefore it appears to me me that they should be read, <i>Ditsakh, Adash, Beachav</i>. And their meaning is as if the Holy One, blessed be He is saying, "It is your joy when I crush [the Egyptians] with the tip of the sword"; as the letters <i>ayin</i> (in the initials of the plague that form <i>Adash</i>) and <i>alef</i> (in the word, "I crush") interchange; as does [the order] of two letters in one word, as in <i>simlah</i>, <i>salmah</i>  (which both mean dress) and <i>keves</i>, <i>kesev</i> (which both mean lamb). And <i>Adash</i> is based on the verse in Habakuk 3:12, "with anger do You crush nations." And <i>Beachav</i> is based on the verse in Ezekiel 21:20, "the tip of (<i>ivchat</i>) the sword"; and Rashi explained that the [final letter,] <i>tav</i> is not part of the root but only comes to connect [it and make it possessive].      
<b>the Holy One, blessed be He, brought, etc.:</b> Since the plagues came by law and justice upon the Egyptians, therefore the teacher of the mishnah designated them to the Holy One, blessed be He, who is the true Judge. But with the miracles that were performed for our forefathers, he did not designate them to the Holy One, blessed be He, because the exact law would not have granted that they were worthy of the miracle; as Rashi wrote on Parshat Beshalach (Rashi on Exodus 14:19, on the verse, "and He went after them"), "these are idol worshipers and these are idol worshipers, etc." - Midrash Shmuel. 
<b>Ten [plagues] at the [Reed] Sea:</b> That which the teacher had the miracles (plagues) at the sea precede [the ones in Egypt], is answered in Midrash Shmuel; that the essence of the plagues was in order that His name would be recounted in the world. And the main knowledge of [God's involvement] was only recognizable when God [visibly] distinguished between Egypt and Israel. Therefore since they were the main ones in terms of the quality of publicity; for that reason, he placed them first, even though they were not first in time. 
<b>[With] ten trials did our ancestors test the Omnipresent, [blessed be He], in the Wilderness:</b> And even though the [golden] calf was a sin, it is called a trial; as the matter of a trial for the Holy One, blessed be He, is [the demonstration of] lack of faith and of their reliance upon Him. And so [too] is the sin of the calf, as they did not believe and they did not  trust Him, that they could walk safely in the wilderness upon which He had taken them from Egypt and until here. And Rabbi Bartenura did not keep the chronological order, but rather took them in groups of two. But there is an objection; as in the coming up from the sea, that Rabbi Bartenura wrote is "And they came to Marah" (Exodus 15:23-24), what 'coming up from the sea' is it - as behold it was three days afterwards? And so [too], Rambam - from whose commentary Rabbi Bartenura quoted, did not connect this [test] at Marah to the coming up from the sea. And in the gemara in the third chapter of Arakhin 15a we say, "One upon the going up from the sea" - and it is explained that it was immediately when they came up from the sea that they said, "In the same way as we are coming up on this side, the Egyptians are coming up on the other side"; and they bring [a source for] it from (Psalms 106:7), "and they rebelled upon the sea, at the Reed Sea." And corresponding to this [addition of another trial], they did not count the grumblers at all [so that there would still be only ten tests]. And it is true that there is objection [that could be raised] against the [Talmud] - why did it not count the grumblers? Therefore it appears to me that the gemara held that the grumblers and the mixed multitude were one matter, and even though the Lord burned some of them with fire, they did not become quiet, [but rather (Numbers 11:4)] "And the mixed multitude that was within them, etc." And that is [the meaning of that] which is written, "and they went back (which can also be understood as they repented) and cried" - that they repented for the beginning of their grumbling. And it is like that in the chapter [entitled] Kol Kitvei (Shabbat 116a), "It was taught, Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says, 'In the future this section (of "and it was when it traveled" - Numbers 10:35 - as it is speaking about that there) will be removed from there and be written in its place.'" And why was it written here [and not in its place]? In order to interrupt between the first calamity and the second calamity. What is the second calamity? "And the people were like grumblers" (Numbers 11:1). The first calamity? "And they traveled from the mountain of the Lord" (Numbers 11:33).' And Rabbi Chama bar Chanina said, "[This means, they turned away from the Lord." And Tosafot objected, as there are still two adjacent calamities. And they forced [it] greatly to answer [this question]. And for me, just the opposite, it is answered just as [you are saying,] that the grumblers and the mixed multitude are [actually only] one punishment. And you should know that since it asked, "what is the second," and it did not first ask on the first; we understand from this that it [already] knew [what it was]. And "The first calamity? 'And they traveled, etc.'" was not placed in the gemara afterwards in the way of a question - "What is the second?" - but rather the redactor of the gemara [is simply] informing us what it is. But the questioner in the study hall only asked about the second, as he held that the grumblers were grumbling [about] the study at the mountain of the Lord, as per later, and there is no interruption (between the calamity of the grumblers and the calamity of "And the mixed multitude") and [the responder in the study hall] answered him, "'And they were like grumblers'"; meaning to say, from there did the second begin, and all of [what follows after it] is one calamity. And [this] is not like the commentary of Rashi who answers that the mixed multitude is [part of] the first, which they began when they turned away from the Lord. And the Tosafot already objected against him and brought [from] Midrash Vayekhelu that the first calamity, that they turned away from the Lord, was that since they learned much Torah at Mount Sinai, they [ran away] like a child who runs away from school. So does it appear to me. (And 'I found me strength' in the Midrash Rabbah, Parshat Metsora, where they said, "From where did Israel become liable for [the afflictions] of abnormal genital emissions and skin disease (<i>tsaraat</i>)?" And several <i>amoraiam</i> (later Talmudic period teachers) disagreed about the reason. And there was one of them, Rabbi Yehuda beRebbe Simon, that said, "[That it was] from the grumblers, as it is stated (Numbers 11:20), 'until it will come out of your noses and it will be for loathing (<i>lezara</i>).'" What is <i>lezara</i>? Rav Huna said, "<i>lezorna</i> and <i>lebisna</i>." And the writer of Matanot Kehunah explained in the name of Arukh [that this means] types of skin disease and bloating. To here [are his words]. And there are many <i>amoraiam</i> that explain <i>lezara</i> [to be] about this matter. And from here, if it were not that the grumblers and the mixed multitude were one thing, how could he say, [the afflictions were] from the grumblers and bring a proof from "and it will be for loathing," which is only said about the mixed multitude? But rather it is all one and it is a complete proof to my words. And I also say that even the simple meaning of the verse proves that it is all one; as behold, it is stated, "And the mixed multide, etc. and they returned (or repented) and cried." And the understanding of "and they returned/repented" can only be about something that already was to [them]. And also, if it is not coming for this, why is "any they returned/repented" written at all. This too is an elucidated proof.) But for Rambam and Rabbi Bartenura who explained that the grumblers and the mixed multitude are two, I could say that it is because of Rabbi (Yehuda Hanassi) who holds in the chapter [entitled] Kol Kitvei that "and it was when it traveled" is in its place, [and] holds that there is no interruption. And our undifferentiated mishnah in Mishnah Yadayim 3:5 at the end of the chapter [follows] Rabbi [about this]. And in any case, it appears to me that we should not count [the sin of the golden] calf at all, as it is not a trial but a sin; and in its place I will insert that which we say in the gemara in Arakhin, "and they rebelled upon the sea, the Reed Sea." And there are seventy faces to the Torah. <b>did our ancestors test the Omnipresent, [blessed be He], in the Wilderness:</b> As because they were in the wilderness - a desolate place with no inhabitants and lacking everything and having nothing - they thought that maybe it was from the lack of His supervision, may He be blessed, of this region, and therefore they tested Him. And that is [the reason] that he was exacting to teach, "in the desert" and actually called the Holy One, blessed be He, "the Omnipresent (literally, the Place)" here; to teach that He is the Place of the world without any [part of the world being] devoid of His supervision. So is it explained in Midrash Shmuel.

Mishnah 5



Mishnah 6

<b>Ten things were created on the eve of the [first] Shabbat at twilight. And these are they: The mouth of the earth, etc.:</b> Rambam wrote and this is his language: "They would not have believed in the change of the [Divine] will at each and every instant. Rather, at the beginning of the making of things, He put into [their] nature that they would do what they would [eventually] do; be the thing something that happens [frequently] and that is a natural thing, or be it a change that happens infrequently and that is a miracle - it is all equal. Therefore they said that on the sixth day, He placed into the nature of the earth that it would sink Korach and his congregation and that the well should produce water and that the donkey would talk and so [too] with the rest... And perhaps you will say, 'since all of the wonders were placed into the nature of those things from the six days of creation, why did [the mishnah] designate these [particular] ten things'; you should know that it did not designate them to say that there is no miracle that was placed into the nature of things besides these. Rather it said that these things were done only at twilight and the other wonders and miracles were placed into the nature of things that they should do this, at the time when they were made at the beginning. And they said, by way of example, that the second day in the splitting of the waters, it was placed into their nature that the Sea of Reeds would split for Moshe and that the Jordan [would split] for Yehoshua; and so [too] for Elisha. And the fourth day when the sun was created, it was placed into its nature that it would stop at a certain time when Yehoshua would speak to it. And so [too] with the other wonders, besides these ten that were placed into the nature of these things at twilight." To here are his [words]. And more than this did he elucidate in the his book, Guide for the Perplexed 2:29. And there he said after he brought their midrash, "A condition he made, etc." and he concluded and said that the sign of a prophet is that God informs him of the time that which he shall say that [the miracle] will be, and He will do this thing as He placed it in its nature, since it is in the root of what is in its nature. To here [are his words.] And there is very much an objection upon this [in the] statement of Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him (Exodus 8:5), "for what time shall I entreat?" And Isaiah [similarly] said (Isaiah 7:11), "Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord, your God, make your question from the deep or from the heights above.' [Likewise,] the question of Gideon for the sign of the fleece with two opposites.  And in Midrash Shmuel [it is written] in the name of Meiri, may his memory be blessed, that the opinion of the sages which these teachers [of the mishnah] were is not that nature is fixed within that which is acted upon but [rather] their intention without a doubt was with regards to the Actor, may He be blessed and His will; to say that there was no change of his Will in front of Him, may He be blessed - God forbid. For at the time that He created the heavens and the earth and everything in it, He implanted and included His knowledge of the things that would be in the future and that there would already come a time that the nature of that object would be changed etc. and on that condition did He create it, etc. And if so, the making of the miracle was not a change in His knowledge and a novelty of His will, etc. To here are his words. Which is to say that all of the signs were created and made for their time and for their moment, but they were not placed into nature that they should be done at that [specific] moment. And even even though He already implanted His knowledge in it, it already preceded in the mishnah, "All is foreseen" - mishnah 11 (15 in the Sefaria edition) of chapter 3, that knowledge does not compel possible things [to be]. And behold all of the miracles are dependent and waiting upon the possible choice that is in the hands of man; as all of them - I mean miracles - were for the sake of people. And I say that just like about the resolution of that question in "All is foreseen and freewill is given," Rambam responded from the verse (Isaiah 55:8), "For My thoughts are not your thoughts," as I wrote there; so [too] 'do I respond [with these] words,' that the end of the verse is itself the answer in the resolution of this huge question that is compelled by the matter of miracles, since there is no change in His will, may He be blessed. And that is that which He says, "and your ways are not my ways." As is ways are his actions, as so did Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - say (Exodus 33:13), "Please inform me of your ways," and these are His conduct and action[s] in the world. He said that "your ways are not My ways," which is to say that you should not compare your ways to my ways, and [then] this huge question will not [arise]. And Rambam himself wrote (in his book, Guide for the Perplexed 3:20 at the end) and this is his language: the matter of perception and the matter of knowledge and the matter of intention that is ascribed to us are not the matters that are ascribed to Him. And when the two perceptions or the two knowledges or the two intentions are taken in order to put them together into one matter, the questions mentioned [arise]. And when it is made known that all of what is ascribed to us is separate from what is ascribed to Him, the truth is elucidated. And He already mentioned the difference between those that are ascribed to Him and those that are ascribed to us when He said, "and your ways are not My ways." To here [are his words]. But it also appears from his language in Guide for the Perplexed 29:2 that that which he explains the words of the sages when they say, "a condition did He make, etc." in the way mentioned, that this is not his own opinion [about what they mean]. And it is enough for us that we have saved Rambam with [the explanation above] regarding his own opinion, even though we cannot rescue him in his opinion about the opinion of the sages. But I say that this is also the opinion of the sages, may their memory be blessed, and it is not [too] wondrous for them, God forbid. All the more so, as it is from an explicit verse - [you can even] go to a schoolhouse and read it. And they only said that they were created on the eve of Shabbat about his knowledge, as in "All is foreseen," and like the words of Meiri. And [regarding] their statement (Bereshit Rabbah 5:5), "The Holy One, blessed be He, made a condition from the six days of creation with the sea that it should split, etc.," it appears in my eyes that its subject is not at all about rejecting change in His will. But rather it is the same as their statement that I wrote on Chapter 2, Mishnah 8 (Tosafot Yom Tov on Mishnah Avot 2:8:2) which they stated on the verse, "The sixth day," that "the Holy One, blessed be He, made a condition with the [acts] of creation, that it be on condition that Israel will accept upon themselves the five books of the Torah"; and that is not a natural thing. But [rather] it teaches about the purpose of the the creation of the world - that it was only created for the acceptance of the Torah by Israel; and if they would not accept it, the world will go back to being chaos and void, as it was only created for this purpose. And so [too] all of these conditions are said from this angle in all [types] of expression of merit and magnification of Israel: that the Holy One, blessed be He, made a condition at [the time of creation] with the sea that it should split for Israel, as because of this He created the sea; and so [too] with the sun that it should stand for Yehoshua, as because of this it was created. And with this, they greatly rooted the faith that everything was only created for the sake of Israel. [And this] agrees with their statement, "'<i>Bereshit</i> (In the beginning)' - for the sake of Israel that is called <i>reshit</i>." And they have many statements that they said to praise and give merit to Israel. And we will not deny that with this statement of theirs, they also intended to say that He, may He be blessed and exalted, '[can] speak the end from the beginning' and 'observes the end of the thing in its beginning.' But this is from the angle that such is His knowledge, my He be blessed, as in the matter of "All is foreseen," but not that they came here with the intention to repudiate change in His will and knowledge. For they were never obligated to do this, since the prophet Yeshayahu already preceded them to remove this enigma when he said (Isaiah 55:8), "For My thoughts are not your (your thoughts) and your ways are not [My ways]" - that they should not be compared together, and [then] we will not come to have a question. And they only intended with the expression of "He made a condition" to [to convey the same] as the language of the midrash "that on the sixth day." And our teacher, Derekh Chaim, 'was wondrous of counsel and magnified understanding' to remove this question: he said that the [divine] knowledge and ability are all from his actions; as it is written (Exodus 2:25), "and God knew' - that is an expression of action. And just like the other actions do not obligate change and do not [obligate] growth in Him, may He be blessed; so [too] do these also [not]. And about this he was supported by the wisdom of the Kabbalah. See there.
<b>were created on the eve of the [first] Shabbat at twilight. And these are they: The mouth of the earth, etc.:</b> These ten things were specifically designated at this time even according to the opinion of Rambam. And many explications of their reasons have been said - you will find them in Midrash Shmuel. [And] I did not see [fit] to quote even one of them, as I did not know which one is is proper. And since I saw in our teacher, Derekh Chaim who wrote in the mishnah before this about the "ten miracles that were done for our forefathers in the Temple" [and] was precise in it that that which they began with a woman, to say that no woman miscarried and ended that "no man said, 'this place is too cramped,'" correspond to the ten spheres (<i>sefirot</i>) of nothingness, and he elucidated them one by one, see there; I thought that just as and even more nice [would be] to expound like that in this place. As behold, with the ten spheres of nothingness was the world created, and without a doubt that so [too] is it with these ten things. And the beginning with the mouth of the earth was like the miracles [that began] with the woman. But in that which is too wondrous for me, I will not expound. And I say according to that which is revealed that these ten things [correspond] to the ten statements with which the world was created. As so does the first statement recount about the matter of the earth, that it was chaos, etc. And the mouth of the well [corresponds] to the statement, "'Let there be light,'" as so was that light hidden, and thus [too] was the well hidden in the Sea of Tiberius. And the mouth of the donkey [corresponds] to the statement, "'Let there be a firmament... and let it divide,'" and the upper waters reversed, which is not natural; so [too] was placing of the mouth of the donkey in crass matter not natural.  And the rainbow is like the statement, "'Let the waters be gathered together... and let the dry land appear'"; as so is the existence of the rainbow from the mist of the damp earth that became wet from rain waters. And the manna [corresponds] to the statement, "'Let the earth put forth, etc. fruit-tree, etc.,'" as they are the bread of man and 'his fruit which is given to him at its time'; and corresponding to them, He brought down grain of the skies, which is the manna. And the staff corresponds to the statement of the luminaries, that it states about them, "'let them be for signs'"; and He sent Moshe, His servant, with the staff with which he would perform signs, and from this extended [the notion that] 'from the signs of the sky do not be afraid.' And the <i>shamir</i> which is a creature like a worm is from the statement, "'Let swarm, etc.'" And the letters and the writing correspond to the two statements - the statement of "'living creatures'" and the statement of "'let us make man'" - as in both [pairs] there is life and something [more] spiritual.  So is it with the letters and the writing as there is in the writing something more spiritual in that which it can be read from all four directions, as per the explanation of Rabbi Bartenura. And so [too], man has an advantage over the living creatures in that he can speak and rule over the four directions of the world. And the tablets correspond to "'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth'" with the seed of men that are made in the image of God; and so [too] are the tablets the work of God. See this which is a proper approach in front of me. 'And give to the wise and he will become even wiser' to think of reasons even more adequate. And [so too here] upon this way, this resolves [why] our teacher [of this mishnah] had no chronological order in all of these. 
(<b>The mouth of the earth:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "to swallow Korach and his congregation." And so [too] did Rambam explain. And there is an objection, as [Moshe] said (Numbers 16:30), "'And if the Lord creates a creation." And behold, [this] was already created and waiting according to the transmission here of the sages, may there memory be blessed. And their transmission was exclusively one man from another, [back] until Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him. And in a homiletic discussion in the [chapter entitled] Chelek (Sanhedrin 110a and Nedarim 39b.), they explained, "If <i>gehinnom</i> is created [already], that is good, etc." [otherwise] let it be created, [is referring] to bring close its opening, as [<i>gehinnom</i> itself] is certainly created, as it is written (Ecclesaistes 1:9), "there is nothing new at all, etc." And according to their words there is a type of question that exists, and this too is forced. And therefore [the below] is what appears [correct] to me with the prefacing of the three other precise observations. 1) [Moshe's] saying (Numbers 16:30), "and the ground will extend its mouth," and at the time of the event it is stated, "and it opened." And even if it were not stated so in the time of the event, it is appropriate to be exact; why did he not use the expression, opening, which is more common than is the expression, extending? 2) That which he said, "and they will descend alive towards the pit": As from that which he didn't say [to] the pit, it is [because] of that which Rashi, may his memory be blessed, mentioned in Psalms 9:18, [about] "May the evildoers return towards to the pit"; "Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said, '[it is to tell us that they will go] to the lowest level of the pit.'" And even though one cannot deny the testimony of scripture; still, when the verse informs of the matter, is it not good and even nice for the elucidator and the researcher to inform how we should publicize and know that they went to the lowest level of the pit? And, if so, an investigation is needed in this verse [to see] where, however, it informs us [that it is] like this. 3) It says (Bemidbar 16:34), "and they fled because of their voices." And it it is not the way of those that hear the voice of those yelling out, "oy, oy" to flee, but rather to approach that voice to listen to the reason for which they are yelling. And behold, Rashi, may his memory be blessed, wrote, "'because of their voices' [means] on account of the voice that went out from their being swallowed." And Rabbi E. Mizrachi explained that this is the voice that went out from the crevice like a type of thunder which confounds people to make them run away; [and] not from the voice of their yelling at the time of their being swallowed - as that voice is not one that makes [others] run away, but rather just the opposite, it gathers the people together to come and hear the cries at that time to see this wonder, of which there was none like it since the six days of creation until that day. To here [are his words]. And from here I say about the voice of the splitting, that even though Rabbi Mizrachi says that it was like a type of thunder, I can [still] say that this voice was projecting and speaking a voice of words that they descended to the pit alive, that is to the lowest level. And it was a great sign that the earth projected a voice of speech that enunciated and said that they went alive to the lowest level - that they were in pain [all the way] until there. And this is what Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him - requested when he said, "and will extend." As about opening for the sake of swallowing, he should have said, "and will open," and like it said in the [actual] event. But he said, "and will extend," as the expression [is used in], "and I extended my mouth to the Lord" of Yiftach in the Book of Judges 11:35, and as the expression [is used in], "my lips have extended" in the Book of Psalms 66:14, the matter of which is speech. And so did he say, "And if the Lord creates a creation and the ground will extend its mouth." And it is lacking [a letter] <i>bet</i> as a preposition for the word creation, as in "six days did God make, etc.," the [meaning] of which is [as if it added <i>bet</i> as a preposition,] "in six days." And so [too], "and we will pay the bulls of our lips", the [meaning] of which is [as if it added <i>bet</i> as a preposition,] with our lips." And [there are other examples] besides them lacking the <i>bet</i>. [Such that Moshe] is saying, "If <i>gehinnom</i> is in the creation from the six days of creation, bringing close its opening should be created, as their statement, may their memory be blessed. And  via the bringing close of the opening to here, "and the earth will extend its mouth" to project the voice of lips, the voice of words, to tell all of what is done within it until the lowest level of the pit. And afterwards at the time of the event, it stated (Numbers 16:32), "And the earth opened its mouth" - opening of the mouth alone, not [with] speech. And the opening was concerning the matter of "and it swallowed them up." And nonetheless it was that every man "fled from their voice," which was the voice that went out about their being swallowed up, a voice of words projecting that they descended alive to the pit, to the lowest chamber of the pit. And there is also a type of proof to that which I have explained, [in] that which the teacher [of the mishnah] taught, concerning the matter of the donkey to say, "the [mouth of the donkey"] (to the mouth), and not that  the donkey was created at twilight. And behold, all mouths are equal and what is it with the donkey that its mouth of needs creation at twilight, if it is not that the matter of the mouth in the donkey is speech, such that this is what was created at twilight. If so, the mouth of the earth is also about speech, that is [what] he is [saying] about the opening of the mouth in general. And a second witness is the mouth of the well, according to "there are those that explain," mentioned by Rabbi Bartenura - that its explanation is that the well uttered song, etc. And all of this appears [correct] to me and in my eyes it appears [to fit like a glove.])  
<b>and the mouth of the well:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "the well of Miriam that went with Israel in the wilderness on all of the journeys." And in Derekh Chaim, [its author] explained that in every place that they would go, the well would rise and spring forth water. And for this well was created a mouth (an opening) that the water would come out from in every place that they would go. And it does not appear that the boulder would go and roll with them as appears prima facie from the words of Rashi in the chapter [entitled] Makom sheNehagu (Pesachim 54a). As, if so, why is the miracle not mentioned, that the boulder gave water unattached [to any spring or well]? But rather the intention of Rashi is also as we have said. To here [are his words].  And that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And some say, that it opened its mouth and uttered song, as it stated (Numbers 21:17), 'rise up, O well; answer it,'" meaning to say that they would answer corresponding to its speech. (And see above. And hence that which it does not say, "the mouth of the boulder" is justified and resolved. As is not the boulder that which brought out the water? And about it is it said, the mouth that brought out [water] was what was created at twilight. But we are required to force [the explanation of] "the mouth of the well," and explain that it means the mouth from which the well came out. But according to the 'some explain,' it is good that the teacher [of the mishnah] taught, "the mouth of the well," as it uttered song, etc.) 
<b>and the mouth of the donkey:</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "it was decreed about it, etc." As it is not probable that it was living for so [long] from the six days of creation until the time of Bilaam. And so [too] is it explained in Derekh Chaim, that all of these ten things that were created at twilight are not [referring to] a literal creation, but rather to a  decree at twilight that decreed the creation. As it does not appear [correct] that the ram of Yitschak was living from the six days of creation until Avraham. To here [are his words]. And so [too] did Rabbi Bartenura explain about the ram that was decreed, etc. (And the explanation of the expression "mouth" [here], I have written at the end of s.v. pi haaretz, etc. (the mouth of the earth).
<b>the writing:</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "that they could be read from all four sides." And what is likely to me is that this was a miracle and that they were the work of God. And many hesitated in explaining this from among the commentators of Talmud Yerushalmi Shekalim 6 - see in Ein Yaakov and Yafeh Mareh. And after the last one do I go - the writer of the Ten Essays, who wrote in his Essay [entitled] Chakor Din, Part II, Chapter 20 about this statement in the Yerushalmi, that it was [so designed because it was] the work of God, which cannot be analysed with our intellects; not like the work of an ordinary one that [others] besides us would describe in front of us in the study hall and 'a youth could write them down.' To here [are his words].
<b>the tablets:</b> Rabbi Bartenura wrote they "were [made] of sapphire... and they were quarried from the ball of the sun;" which is to say that therefore were they soft and not like our sapphire which is hard and not soft. But it was sapphire-like to behold and like the actual sky in purity. And in the commentary of Rashi [it is written] that the tablets [here] are the first tablets, as regarding the second, Moshe chiseled them himself.
<b>And some say, also the destructive spirits, etc. And some say, also the [first human-made] tongs, etc.:</b> In Derekh Chaim, he concludes that they are not coming to disagree, but rather each one adds on those that preceded him (with each addition corresponding to a progressively earlier part of twilight). As there are different times for twilight, as is learned in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Madlikin (Shabbat 34b), "Which is twilight? 'From the time that the sun sets [and] the entire time that the face of the East is reddened...' - [these are] the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Nechemiah says, '[The time it takes] for a man to walk for half a <i>mil</i>, from the time the sun has set.'  Rabbi Yose says, 'Twilight is like the wink of an eye, this comes in and this goes out, and it is impossible to catch it.'" And he wrote that there are various textual variants in the text of these "some say" and that it appears to him that the correct variant is, "[And some say] the ram of Yitschak and the grave of Moshe" [since they belong together] as both of them are needs of great righteous men. "And some say also the destructive spirits; and some say also the tongs." And these three "some say" divide twilight into three times, besides the twilight of Rabbi Yose that has no continuum of time at all. But the rest of twilight they divided into three, as everything measurable has a beginning, a middle and an end. To here are his words. And according to that which the gemara pushes off that [opinion] about the tongs, it comes out that there are only two additions; and the one is in the twilight of Rabbi Nechemiah and the [other] one is in the twilight of Rabbi Yehuda. And so [too] is it according to our textual variant that only has two "some say." And according to the opinion of everyone those ten things [listed] were created at the twilight of Rabbi Yose. And therefore their reasoning [also included them] as we said.

Mishnah 7

<b>An unformed person (<i>golem</i>):</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained,  "This is an expression as per [its usage in the phrase,]  'unformed vessels (<i>golmei kelim</i>) [the work on which has not been completed],'" (Mishnah Kelim 12:6) that are lacking completion and finish. Like a knife or sword when the blacksmith makes their form and they have acquired their shape, before he sands them and sharpens them and polishes them and he removes from them what is his custom to remove and he completes their finish. And so [too, the mishnah] calls a <i>golem</i> a man who has intellectual virtues and virtuous character traits, yet they are not complete and do not flow in proper order. [Rather,] they are mixed up and confused and there are lackings mixed in with them. And this is not an ignorant man (<i>am haarets</i>) who has [knowledge] of the ways of the world (which are only virtuous traits), and all the more so is it not the boor in Mishnah 5 of Chapter 2 - Rambam. And see Mishnah 10 in the commentary of Rabbi Bartenura (s.v. sheli).
<b>and seven in a wise man. A wise man does not speak, etc.:</b> Since the unformed person is first temporally, therefore [the mishnah] first learned, "Seven things [are found] in an unformed person." But nonetheless, it elucidated the traits that are of the wise man, as it is pleasant to bring them to the lips; he will kiss the traits of the wise man and the knowledge of [their] opposites [will come together with it]. Therefore it said, "And their opposites [are the case] with an unformed person."  
<b>does not speak in front of some one who is greater than him, etc.:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "As so have we found with Elazar and Itamar, etc." And this is with regards to [giving] an answer, but with regards to [asking] a question, behold, we learned in Mishnah 5 of Chapter 2, "A person prone to being ashamed cannot learn."
<b>or in number:</b> The language of Rashi: "in years, and [having more] students." To here [are his words]. And see what I have written on Mishnah 5 of the first Chapter of Eduyot (Tosafot Yom Tov on Mishnah Eduyot 1:5, s.v. ouveminyan). And there are books that don't have the textual variant,  "or in number." And, nonetheless, for those that have it in their version, it is teaching, either [wisdom] or [numbers]. And so is it written in Midrash Shmuel.
<b>and is not impulsive in answering:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "so that his answer be as is proper." Which means to say, that it is not enough that which "he does not interrupt the words of his fellow," but he also waits until he knows that he will answer as is proper.
<b>and he asks to the point and answers as is proper:</b> [About] that which Rabbi Bartenura wrote, "And so [too] do you find with the people that were impure. etc., who saw that Moshe was involved, etc.," from the simple meaning of the verses, we do not understand [this] at all. But rather on that day that all of Israel made sacrifices and they were not able to make the Pesach sacrifice on that day, "and they approached in front of Moshe," as it is written in the verse (Leviticus 9:6). And see what I have written on Mishnah 2 of Chapter 6 in Pesachim (Tosafot Yom Tov on Mishnah Pesachim 6:2, s.v. hazaah). And the words of Rabbi Bartenura are quoted in several of these sections in Midrash Shmuel, but "And so do you find [with the people], etc." is not quoted.
<b>and about that which he has not heard [anything], says, "I have not heard [anything]":</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "If he is deciding a legal case from the analysis of his own mind, he should not say, 'So have I heard from my teachers.'" And it made me wonder, as this is the measure of every man - not to lie. All the more so in a legal decision, that he should make himself dependent on a [greater authority]; and perhaps the listeners will depend upon him because they heard that he received this [from a greater authority]. And it will come out that he will make the masses stumble, as it is possible that the law is not like this. And also the proof that the brought from the men of Charan is not [relevant] to this case at all. And Rambam explained, "And he should not glorify himself with that which he did not hear, and that is what it is saying, 'about that which he has not heard [anything], says, "I have not heard [anything]."' To here [are his words]. And about this the proof of the men of Charan is justified, as if it is so with matters of the world, all the more so with matters of wisdom and Torah.

Mishnah 8

<b>Categories (literally, bodies) of sin:</b> Which is to say, differing sins. And so [too] is their language, may their memory be blessed, to call differing sins by the name, "differing bodies," as you can see in the language of Rabbi Bartenura on Mishnah Keritot 3:10:9. And since it said, "kinds of" about punishments, and it did not suffice to [just have] the number, seven, it also said with the sins, "bodies of," and did not suffice with the number, seven. So does it appear to me. 
<b>[When] some of [the people] give tithes, and others do not give tithes:</b> I have already written earlier in the first chapter on Mishnah 16 that in many places they take the word "tithe (<i>maaser</i>)" and it refers to all of the gifts [to the Levites and priests]. And the opinion of Derkh Chaim is that "giving tithes" [here] is specifically [referring to] tithes; and the priestly tithe is not included, as [with it] one [kernel] of wheat exempts the whole threshing floor, which is not the case with the dough [offering], about which it is written, "giving." See there. And it is not implied like that in the gemara [in the] (chapter) [entitled Bemeh Madlikin] (Shabbat 32b). 
<b>A famine from drought comes:</b> In [the chapter entitled] Bemeh Madlikin (Shabbat 32b), [it is stated,] "'Drought and also heat will steal away the waters of the snow, the pit those that sinned (Job 24:19)' - because of the things that I commanded you (about the various tithes) during the days of the summer and you did not do them; the waters of the snow will be stolen from you during the days of winter."
<b>and not to set apart the dough [offering]:</b> Which is to say, "also not set apart the dough [offering]." And that which Midrash Shmuel wrote - that one can say that it is only the dough [offering], and the reason it is more stringent is because that since he could have kneaded less than the [requisite] amount [for the obligation to apply], and he did not do so, behold, it is like he is negating a commandment to cause [God] anger; but a person cannot do this with other various tithes in such a way as to  exempt himself legally. To here [are his words]. - is on a rabbinic level. As were it on a Torah [level], he is able to bring [produce] in through the roof or the storeyards; as the Torah only obligates [the separation of tithes] of that which he brings in to the house, as it is written (Deuteronomy 26:13), "'I have disposed of the holy things from my house,'" and that which he brings in by way of the entrance, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 26:12), "and they will eat in your entrances;" as is decided by Rambam at the beginning of Mishneh Torah, Tithes 4.
(<b>Pestilence comes to the world for the death penalties, etc.:</b> See in the mishnah below, s.v. bearbaah perakim, etc.)
<b>that are not given over to the court [to carry out]:</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "[such] that they did not perform a Torah judgement (<i>din Torah</i>) on them." And since the court and the leaders of the people sinned and did not do [a judgement], pestilence comes to the world, and it does not distinguish (between the good and the bad), 'and it will be to the righteous one like the evil one.' But the expression, "that are not given over to the court" does not imply this, but rather like the commentators explain - for example, death penalties by the hand of the Heavens and excisions (<i>keritot</i>); and also (another explanation is) without warning or witnesses, or that the sinner escaped [such that the court cannot punish him]. 
<b>and for [violation of the laws governing] the produce of the Sabbatical year:</b> The laws of which are to render them ownerless; and also (another explanation is) to completely dispose of them, as I wrote the opinions in Mishnah Sheviit 9:2. And therefore it is poetic justice that pestilence comes to the world, as it causes people to be 'ownerless,' as the destructive angel does not distinguish. But with the sword, it is possible that if his voice supplicates, the enemy will surely hear him and leave him. So did he explain in Derekh Chaim. And these two [sins] are considered one in the count of seven since they are similar in their punishment. And so [too] those below.
<b>[The] sword comes to the world for the delay of justice:</b> As it is written (Leviticus 26:25), "And I will bring upon them a vengeful sword, to avenge the covenant" - and covenant can only be Torah, as it is written (Leviticus 26:43), "because, surely because, you have rejected my statutes" - Gemara - Shabbat 33a.

Mishnah 9

<b>Destructive animals come to the world because of false oaths and because of the desecration of God's name:</b> As it is stated (Leviticus 26:23), "And if you will not be chastised with these (<i>eleh</i>)" - do not read [it as] <i>eleh</i>, but rather as <i>allah</i> (oath, which is spelled with the same letters). (And both a vain and a false [oath] are implied). And it is written (Leviticus 26:23), "And I will send upon you the animals of the field, etc." And it is written about a false oath (Leviticus 19:12), "you shall not swear in My name falsely and desecrate the name of your God." And about the desecration of God's name, it is written (Leviticus 22:32), "And you shall not desecrate My holy name" - Gemara (Shabbat 33a). 
<b>Exile comes to the world because of the worshipers of idols, etc.:</b> [Because of] the spilling of blood, as it is stated (Numbers 35:33-34), "And you shall not corrupt, etc. And you shall not defile that land that you are settled in, within which I dwell"- behold, [if] you defile it , you will not be settled in it and I will not dwell within it. [Because of] sexual immorality, as it is stated (Leviticus 18:27), "As all of these abominations did the people of the land do"; and it is written (Leviticus 18:25), "And the land became defiled and I visited its iniquity upon it"; and it is written (Leviticus 18:28), "And do not have the land vomit you out because of your defiling it." [Because of] idol worship, it is written (Leviticus 26:30), "and I will put your corpses, etc."; and it is written (Leviticus 26:31), "and I will make your holy places desolate and I will scatter you among the nations." [Because of] the Sabbatical and Jubilee years, it is written (Leviticus 26:34), "Then will the land have its Sabbatical years appeased, all of the days of desolation and you will be in the land of your enemies"; and it is written (there), "all the days of desolation will it rest" - Gemara [in the chapter entitled] Bemeh Madlikin (Shabbat 33a). 
<b>At four periods of time does pestilence become more widespread, etc.:</b> As when it happens that there is pestilence in those periods of time, it becomes more widespread then through the sin of these [people]; as [this] sin always happens in these [time periods] with some people. And behold, it is poetic justice; as [such a man] took away from the life of the poor person and also thought that if he would give, it would take away from his [own] bread if his days are lengthened. Hence, his life will be taken from, and his produce will remain for others. And from now, there is no objection at all from the previous mishnah - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Rabbi M. Almoshnino.
<b> after the seventh [year]:</b> Because in the seventh [year] itself there is a sin which the one who caused this thing transgressed, hence it becomes more widespread immediately at the end of the seventh [year]; and we did not learn [for this reason], "the eighth year, because of the produce of the seventh year." So wrote Midrash Shmuel. And with me, this is not an inference; as behold, at the end of Mishnah Sotah 7, we learn "in the eighth [year]" and it is not sufficient for [the mishnah], and [so] it ends also, "at the end of the seventh [year]."  
<b>and after the holiday (Sukkot):</b> As at the holiday, occupation with the earth (agricultural pursuits) is already finished. And the one that gave these obligations, gave them; and the one who did not give them, stole them - Rambam.

Mishnah 10

<b>There are four temperaments among men: the one who says "what is mine is mine, etc.":</b> We are not speaking about givers of charity, as those we teach later [in] Mishnah 13, but rather about benefit in general. 
<b>"what is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine" -- [that's an] <i>am ha'arets</i> (uneducated person, literally the people of the land):</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "and this is [for] the  [advancement of] the inhabitation of the land." And [this is] specifically if he wants to benefit from the possessions of others with their knowledge. As if it is without their knowledge - even though he wants to also benefit them - he is a total thief and you can have no greater evildoer than this. And the sages, may their memory be blessed, only spoke about [normative] temperaments and they did not speak about the robber and the thief, who is an evildoer - Midrash Shmuel in the name of Ramah, may his memory be blessed.
<b>"what is mine is yours, and what is yours is yours" -- [that's a] pious person:</b> Not that he scatters everything that he has, as behold, they said (Ketuvot 50a), "The one that scatters, let him not scatter more than a fifth" - so that he not scatter more than enough and he perforce become dependent on the creatures. But rather we are talking about one who foregoes according to what is fit - Derekh Chaim.  

Mishnah 11



Mishnah 12

<b>That is a bad portion:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "It would not be relevant to learn here, 'pious' or 'evil,' as this is not something that is dependent upon his choice, etc." And even though it is possible with the help of Heaven to raise his study, if his fear of sin precedes his wisdom - as it is written in Mishnah 9 of Chapter 3 - it is not fitting for someone who has not reached inclusion of this trait to be called an evildoer, as the disadvantage in his creation led him to this.

Mishnah 13

<b>There are four temperaments among givers of charity:</b> As the mishnah above was also learned about the sustenance of students, as Rabbi Bartenura explained - Midrash Shmuel. And Derekh Chaim wrote that it was fitting to learn [this mishnah] immediately after "what is mine is mine, etc.," except that the one about "quick to understand" is more similar to it; as in both of them, we learn "his gain is cancelled by his loss, etc."       
<b>he has an evil eye with respect to others:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained, "As it is known that [giving] charity makes one wealthy, etc." And so [too] did Rashi explain. And he concludes, and "he has an evil eye regarding himself," because he has brazenness of the heart. And it is not similar to "he has an evil eye regarding others." To here [are his words]. But rather it is to say, it is like the "evil eye" in Mishnah 19, [of the one] who does not suffice with what is his and covets that which is fitting for the poor person. And there is an objection: If so, he is an evildoer, as he transgresses against (Deuteronomy 15:7) "do not harden your heart." And it is possible that here we are speaking about the [case] that there is no lack to the poor person and it comes out that he does not harden his heart from giving to the poor person what he lacks. And if [the poor person] did not have someone to give to him, he would have given. And his desire is to give when he finds a poor person who has no givers; and nonetheless, this is brazenness of heart. And now it comes out well that "[to] give and [that] others give -- [that's a] pious person"; since [some] object that such is the temperament of every man - that he should give and that others should give. But rather here it is concerning a poor person who has what he needs, if the givers were only the others and not he, or that he was the giver and not the others. But behold, he wants that both of them should give - he and also the others - so as to fill his requirements with plenty. It is fitting that such a person be called a pious person. So does it appear to me.   

Mishnah 14

<b>[One who] goes but does not do:</b> The language of Rabbi Bartenura: "He goes to the House of Study to listen but he does not review and study and does not understand." And one can explain that this is what he said: And also he [goes to] study and does not understand. And one can [also] explain that this is what he said: And he does not review and he does not study and he does not understand. And so does it appear from his language in the end that it is all one one matter, and because he does not study, hence he does not understand. And in Midrash Shmuel, he quotes [it as], "as he does not study and he does not understand."     
<b>[One who] goes and does is a pious person:</b> As he lowers himself and acts as if he needs the ones sitting in the House of Study - Midrash Shmuel. And in the name of Ramah, he explained that anyone who leans from the [mean] towards the good side more than towards the bad side is called a pious person. [This is] not because he is pious only in that trait, but rather because this disposition is the disposition of piety; as anyone who acts with this disposition is ready for the virtues of piety. To here [are his words]. And so [too] are the words of Rambam. 

Mishnah 15

<b>Among those who sit before the sages:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained that here "it is speaking about the topic of proper analysis, etc." And this is [why] here it teaches, "sit before the sages."
<b>the sponge:</b> Sea wool - Rambam. 
<b>The sieve:</b> Rabbi Bartenura explained "After we take out the bran, etc. And so would they do with grain offerings"; as is explained in the end of Chapter 6 of Menachot. 

Mishnah 16

<b>Dependent on something:</b> The textual variant of Rabbi Bartenura is "on a transient thing, when that thing perishes, etc."
<b>the love of Amnon and Tamar:</b> It took it as a general example. And therefore there is no objection from the beginning [of the mishnah] against the end.
