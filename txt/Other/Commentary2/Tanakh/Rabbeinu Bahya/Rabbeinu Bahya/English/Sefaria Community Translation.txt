According to the Midrash "and you shall make a guardrail on your roof for the faller will fall from it", he was apportioned to fall from the time of the six days of creation, but you do not need to cause that his death should be on your hands. The idea of this Midrash is that all the creation in their entirety were creation at their request and desire, and the Holy One B"H informed them in the beginning of the creation all of their [related] matters and all that would befall them in the future. And also informed them of the days of their lives and deaths, and how they would occur. And how they would sustain themselves if with spirit or difficult, if independently or with the aid of others. And so our Rabbis have explained that all of the process of creation was performed with its knowledge and with its characters it was created, as it says "and all his legions", and they accepted and desired all; and accordingly they [the Rabbis] said 'he was apportioned to fall from the time of the six days of creation'. And Nevertheless their is a great punishment for those that [surround?], and so we make a guardrail on our roofs.
