Derech Hashem

Introduction

(When one approaches a subject) there is an advantage  of knowing the categorizes and relationships of the (subject matters) parts over knowledge without such distinction. 

Part One

On the Creator

The Existence of G-d: Every Jew needs to believe and know that a First Being exists. [This Being] is without beginning or end. He brought into existence and [constantly] creates everything that is present in existence. This [Being] is G-d.
 Additionally [every Jew] needs to know that the essential reality of this Being, G-d, cannot be [adequately] grasped by any [created being] at all. The only thing known about Him is that He is totally Perfect, having no deficiencies at all. This information, however, is only know through a tradition received from our ancestors and the prophets [we couldn't conclude it on our own].

On Love and Fear of God

Behold, we have already clarified in the first part, fourth chapter,  concepts of love and awe/fear, that these are what draw one close and cause one to cleave to one's Blessed Creator. This is said about true love and awe/fear, that is, love of the Blessed Name and not the love of reward, and awe of His greatness, and not fear of punishment. And behold this awe/fear purifies the person from darkness of the physical body, and causes the presence of the Divine Shechina to rest upon one; and in accordance with the amount of awe/fear, so is the amount of the taharah/purity and the envelopment [of the Divine Shechina], and one who achieves this awe/fear on a constant basis will [merit] the envelopment consistently. And this phenomenon was found with perfection in Moshe/Moses our teacher, peace be upon him. About him is was stated, "Awe/fear for Moshe/Moses was a small matter" (Brachot 32), and so he merited constant Divine envelopment. It is very difficult for people to achieve true awe/fear as is appropriate, but in accordance with their accomplishment, so is the power of taharah/purity and holiness for them, as we mentioned, especially while engaged in a mitzvah or in learning. It is [in fact] the necessary condition for completing the learning or the mitzvah, as we mentioned.
