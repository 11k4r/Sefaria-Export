Derech Hashem

Introduction

[When one approaches a subject] the most effective way to apprehend it is to break down all its details, categorize them, and discern there interrelationships.

Part One

On the Creator

The Existence of G-d: Every Jew needs to believe and know that a First Being exists. [This Being] is without beginning or end. He brought into existence and [constantly] creates everything that is present in existence. This [Being] is G-d.
 Additionally [every Jew] needs to know that the essential reality of this Being, G-d, cannot be [adequately] grasped by any [created being] at all. The only thing known about Him is that He is totally Perfect, having no deficiencies at all. This information, however, is only known through a tradition received from our ancestors and the prophets [we couldn't conclude it on our own].

On the Purpose of Creation



On Mankind

As we have discussed, humanity is the creature created for the purpose of drawing close to God. They are placed between perfection and deficiency, and it is in their hands to earn perfection. Humanity must earn this perfection, however, through their own desire and choice because if they were forced to choose perfection then they would not actually be its master, and God's purpose would not be fulfilled. It as therefore necessary to create humanity with free will. One's inclinations are therefore balanced between good and evil and they are not compelled toward either. They have the power of choice, able to choose either side knowingly and willingly, as well as to possess whichever one they wish. Humanity was therefore created with both a good urge and an evil urge. They have the power to incline in whichever direction they choose.

On Love and Fear of God

Behold, we have already clarified in the first part, fourth chapter,  concepts of love and awe/fear, that these are what draw one close and cause one to cleave to one's Blessed Creator. This is said about true love and awe/fear, that is, love of the Blessed Name and not the love of reward, and awe of His greatness, and not fear of punishment. And behold this awe/fear purifies the person from darkness of the physical body, and causes the presence of the Divine Shechina to rest upon one; and in accordance with the amount of awe/fear, so is the amount of the taharah/purity and the envelopment [of the Divine Shechina], and one who achieves this awe/fear on a constant basis will [merit] the envelopment consistently. And this phenomenon was found with perfection in Moshe/Moses our teacher, peace be upon him. About him is was stated, "Awe/fear for Moshe/Moses was a small matter" (Brachot 32), and so he merited constant Divine envelopment. It is very difficult for people to achieve true awe/fear as is appropriate, but in accordance with their accomplishment, so is the power of taharah/purity and holiness for them, as we mentioned, especially while engaged in a mitzvah or in learning. It is [in fact] the necessary condition for completing the learning or the mitzvah, as we mentioned.
