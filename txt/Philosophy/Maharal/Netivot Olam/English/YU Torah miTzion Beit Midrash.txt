Chapter 2



‎“Rami Bar Chama said: Great is repentance, since it brings healing to the world, as it says, ‘Return ‎wayward sons, I will heal etc.’(Yirmiyahu 3:22) Rabbi Chama son of Chanina considered an apparent ‎contradiction of verses. It says, ‘Return wayward sons,’ [implying that] they were only wayward ‎initially, and it says, ‘I will heal you from your waywardness’ [implying that they are still wayward ‎after returning]! It is not a contradiction; here it is [referring to] repentance from love, and here it ‎is [referring to] repentance from fear.”(Yoma 86a) …‎ Know that repentance is possible for a person because a person is created initially without sin, and ‎when he returns to G-d the person returns to that initial state. Because of this it is appropriate for ‎repentance to bring healing to the world, because healing is also a return to one’s initial state. ‎When people repent and return to their beginnings, the world also returns to its beginning and ‎‎[this] mends all the ruin that exists in the world.‎ Therefore, he said, ‘Great is repentance, since it brings healing to the world,’ [that is to say] when ‎the world cleaves to its beginnings, understand this. And he also said, ‘It says, ‘Return wayward ‎sons’ implying that they were only wayward initially.’ That is to say that as soon as he returns he is ‎healed, for this it is what is written, ‘Return wayward sons.’ And it is written, ‘I will heal you from ‎your waywardness’ [implying that] they need healing. He answers that this (the first case) is by ‎means of love, because one who returns to G-d out of love is certainly healed immediately upon ‎returning, because by means of the love his repentance is complete. And if he returns because of ‎fear his repentance is incomplete and he requires healing from G-d.‎ This is the difference between one who serves (G-d) out of love and one who serves out of fear. ‎Because the one who serves out of love possesses love and cleaving to G-d which is rooted in ‎himself… But the one who serves out of fear, this fear is rooted in G-d and therefore his final ‎healing comes from G-d and not from himself. These matters must be understood very well.‎
