Lights from Darkness

Land of Israel



Chapter 1

The land of Israel is not an external thing, an external national acquisition, a means to the goal of general unity and strengthening of the physical or even spiritual. The land of Israel is an intrinsic section of the nation, attached to it with a living bond, entwined with its existence in internal uniqueness.
It is therefore impossible to explain the uniqueness of the sanctity of the land of Israel, to actualize the depths of love for her, in any humanly rational way. It is only through the divine spirit which is on the nation as a whole, through the natural spiritual nature which exists in the soul of Israel, which spreads out through 
Contemplating the Land of Israel as an external value which serves only the purpose of uniting the ‎nation, even for the sake of enabling the Jewish idea in exile, guarding its form, strengthening faith ‎and reverence and strengthening practical mitzvot in their proper form, does not produce durable ‎fruit. This foundation is rotten, compared to the sacred strength of the Land of Israel. True ‎strengthening of the Jewish idea in exile will only come via deep embedding in the Land of Israel; ‎via yearning for the Land of Israel, [the Jewish idea] will continually receive all of its independent ‎traits.‎
Anticipating of redemption is the force which maintains Jewry in exile, and the Judaism of the Land ‎of Israel is the redemption itself…‎

Chapter 2



We do not reject any conception or understanding [of our relationship with the Land of Israel] which is founded upon righteousness and intellectual sensitivity and awe of heaven, in any form, but only that aspect which wishes to deny the secrets and their great influence upon the national spirit. This is a disaster against which we must battle, with counsel and understanding, with sanctity and with might.

All the conflicts of opinion amongst people and all the internal contradictions that each individual suffers in his thoughts come only from the mental fog in one's thought of the divine, which is an endless sea and all the thoughts, whether practical or theoretical, arise from and return to.
One must always bear in mind the thought, which will be clear without the dross of false imaginations, of false fears, of bad qualities, of herds and disadvantages. The belief of God affirms human beings only as the same degree that divine greatness is explored and learned from that important part of them, which it deserves. Then the soul shines from the upper light by joining love and a complete view of life, and all feelings, opinions and actions are noted. As this fundamental element grows in the soul's innards, so too will grow the action that will act as a divine adherence to emotion and with the admiration of the heart to conduct the whole course of life in a straightforward manner.
