Kovetz 2



Siman 1

Just as [we] must elevate [our] fallen thoughts and traits (in which evil and ugliness may be discerned) to the source of their root in holiness, where we see that they are really exalted thoughts and good traits, so too must [a person] lift up [his] thoughts that are decent but that stand at the lowest level  – where evil and chaos are united with them, even though they face holiness. [He must lift them up] to the most elevated level of the ideal sublime – [a state of being that] is directed only toward total goodness and absolute straightness – until the uplifting [of these decent thoughts] grows and [reaches] the supernal world, over which pure holiness rules in its might.

Siman 2

The insolence (chutzpah) at the time preceding the messiah comes about because the world has progressed to such an extent that it demands an understanding of how every detail is connected to the whole. A detail that is not connected to the great whole cannot satisfy [a person’s] mind. If the world were engaged in [gaining access to] the light of Torah to such a degree that [a person’s] spiritual soul [would] grow to recognize the proper connection between details and spiritual wholeness, then the teshuvah and rectification of the world would be actualized. However, because [people’s] carelessness has led to [a state in which] the light of the inner Torah – which requires [that a person attain] an exalted state and an inherent holiness – has not appeared in the world correctly, the demand [of people for the structure of a life in which the details are understood within the [framework of the] whole has come at a time when the complete revelation of the light and the clearing of the path [leading] to understanding has not yet arrived. And this has caused terrible destruction. We must employ the supernal remedy, which is [the attainment of] increased strength in [our] spiritual ability. Then the common people will, [with their] feeling, directly understand and access a way of comprehending and appraising that which connects all of [their] Torah-[related] knowledge and deeds to the most supernal wholeness. At that point, the strength of spiritual life will again appear in the world, in deed and in thought, and a universal teshuvah will begin to bear its fruit.

Siman 3

The essence of learning Torah for its own sake can come only after [a person] is capable of [gaining] an understanding – accompanied by feeling – of how all of the details of the Torah are beloved and holy, and of how the universal light, which is filled with life and brings life to the world, courses through all of [these] details.

Siman 4

There are various causes of depression. [A person] must overcome all of them with the joy of [performing] a mitzvah. That is a constant joy that suits [the people of] Israel because of the spiritual light that always rests upon them. One cause [of depression] is a tendency,[expressed in] action, for coarse pleasure. A person’s soul is drawn by that to a place of darkness, and [there] it grieves over its descent.[A person] should transform this great woe to joy, for when [his] soul [will] rise from the yoke of exile that had burdened it, a great stream of joy [will] rise up from below, and the sublime, pure [level of reality will] grow ever richer in its spirituality.

Siman 5

(One needs to distinguish and differentiate two levels of Divine Providence governing the world.) God’s guidance [of the universe, as] connected to the moral dimension – whether [in relationship to] individuals or to nations and [other] groups – is all an extension of the nature of universal morality poured into the essence of being. This [guidance is alluded to] by the name <i>Elokim</i> (“God”). However, higher than this stands [God’s] concealed free will, which does not correspond to a revealed moral state. Instead, [it corresponds] to the supernal ideal, which is in consonance with the supernal gaze, transcending the conditions of present day existence. The illuminations that come from this state are the lights of the inner soul of all being. They include the past, present and future, transcending the structure and form of temporal periods. All of this is encompassed in the name “<i>Hashem</i>” as it is structured and in all of the pathways of its permutations.

The rectification of the political state as a whole and the rectification of [each individual’s] body in particular are part of the highest manifestation of holiness – [a manifestation] so holy that it cannot be illuminated in a revealed fashion by means of a characteristic light that has an obviously holy form. Rather, the light is wrapped within [this manifestation of holiness] and [clings] to it like a garment. The noble strands that emerge from these [rectifications are] practical details directed toward the rectification of the state and [of each individual’s physical] health, in the form of Godly commandments. These may be compared to <i>tzitzit</i>. And the culture as a whole may be compared to the <i>tallit</i>. The <i>tzitzit</i> bring forth a holy revelation of all of the light hidden in the entire <i>tallit</i>, with [the light’s] great revelation and manifestation. [Similarly, the] deeds of Godly commandments and holiness that make [their particular] mark in the totality of human action, [deeds] directed toward rectifying [man’s] life – communal and individual –actualize the light hidden in the depths of all the structures of human culture. They bring the revelations [of that light] to the place fit for [the light] and make visible the light of eternal life that gives life to everything, including temporary life.

Siman 21

The <i>nefesh</i> of the sinners of Israel in the era preceding the coming of the Messiah – of those who connect with love to matters concerning the entirety of the Jewish people, the land of Israel and the renaissance of the nation – is more perfected than the <i>nefesh</i> of those fully faithful Jews who lack this quality of an intrinsic sensitivity to the good of the whole and the building of the nation and the land. But the <i>ruach</i> is much more perfected in those who fear God and who keep the Torah and the commandments, even though an intrinsic sensitivity and impulse to act in matters concerning the whole of Israel are not yet as strong in them as they are in those in whom a spirit of transgression fouls their heart to such a degree that they connect themselves to foreign perspectives and to deeds that pollute their physicality and prevent the light of the <i>ruach</i> from being rectified [in them]. As a result, the <i>nefesh</i> [of these sinners] too suffers from their blemishes. The rectification – which will come about via the light of the Messiah [and] which will be greatly aided by the spreading forth of the teaching of the secrets of the Torah and the revelation of the lights of the wisdom of God in all of its forms that are worthy of being revealed – is that Israel will come together in one bond. And [then] the <i>nefesh</i> of those who are [God-]fearing, who keep the Torah, will be rectified by means of the perfected <i>nefesh</i> of the sinners, who are good in regard to matters of the entire [community] and [in regard to] the hopes, material and spiritual, that can be understood by human awareness and sensitivity. And the <i>ruach</i> of the sinners will be rectified by means of the influence of those who fear God, who keep the Torah and who are great in faith. And thus a great light will come to both [groups]. The manifestation of complete <i>teshuvah</i> will come to the world, and then the people of Israel will be prepared for redemption. The supernal <i>tzadikim</i>, the masters of the <i>neshamah</i>, will be the unifying conduits through which the abundant flow of the light of the <i>nefesh</i> will pass from left to right and the abundant flow of the light of the <i>ruach</i> from right to left. And the joy will be very great. “Your priests will don righteousness and Your pious ones will sing joyfully” (Psalms 132:9). And this will be accomplished through the power of the light of the Messiah, who is David himself, who “lifted up the yoke of <i>teshuvah</i>” (Moed Katan 16b). “For the sake of David Your servant, do not reject the face of your anointed one” (Psalms 132:10).

Siman 22

The more a person loves people, the more that one gazes with an approving eye at those who are immersed with all their might in matters of this world and its construction, the more one’s mind becomes settled. If one is capable of turning to the heights, to a supernal spirituality, to Godly perceptions, one will [then] find oneself more at home in his supernal world. The necessary affairs of the world that are incumbent upon humankind [and] that by their nature interfere with the supernal vision will not disturb that person so much, because he or she will know that these are being attended to on his behalf by all of those people who find satisfaction in this practical work of theirs. Ben Zoma said of this: “Blessed is He Who created all of these to serve Me” (Berakhot 58a).

Siman 26

There is no room to ask about the source of a person’s knowledge of supernal information. When we find within the soul a supernal spirit and a treasury of well-arranged knowledge – so that everything is aligned with everything else – [we may know that] this is the pinnacle of clarified [knowledge]. All knowledge that derives from analysis is merely a means of attaining this supernal knowledge, which the soul pours forth from its deepest depths. The most effective means of attaining this supernal trait is clinging to God with all of one’s might and studying the secrets of the Torah.

Siman 27

The light of Israel shows how it is precisely the yearnings that transcend the entire world that give the world life and happiness. Eternity is necessary not only for the sake of eternity but also for the sake of the moment. And the moment is important because it is one of the revelations of eternity. The world is important because it is one form of the infinite numbers of forms through which the light of the Divine Being is revealed.

Siman 30

At times, when there is a need to disregard words of Torah but there is no one in the generation who can show the way, the matter comes about by means of a disruption. At any rate, it is better for the world that such a matter come about by means of an error. In this inheres the principle, “Better that people [do wrong] in error and not with purposeful intent” (Beitsah 30b). Only when prophecy is present in [the nation of] Israel is it possible to institute such a matter – by means of a temporary injunction. Then it is done openly, with permission and as a Godly command. But in consequence of the sealing of the light of prophecy, this rectification come about by means of a [longlasting] disruption that, although it dismays the heart from the aspect of its outer being, causes it to rejoice from the aspect of its inner being.

Siman 31



Siman 32



Siman 33

Holy people must truly be natural people, for whom all the qualities of the nature of body and spirit partake of the quality of life and health. And then in their ascent they are able to raise the world – and all will rise with them.

The wild man thought, that all that he can chew and swallow is nutritious, until experience taught him to distinguish between the harmful and helpful weeds and roots, the nutritious ones and the non-nutritious ones, the tasteful ones and the non-tasteful ones. And all that is happening in the material values is happening in the spiritual ones, except that this study is late to come. And the spiritual savage thinks, that all that is read and written will feed his soul, until he come to distinguish between holy and profane, between the things that give eternal life, and the things that disrupt the course of the true life.
