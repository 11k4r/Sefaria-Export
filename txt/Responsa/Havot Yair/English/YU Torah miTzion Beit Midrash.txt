Teshuva 124


Since you've made known to me that [your son] spoke beautifully at his Bar Mitzvah, I assume he's ‎already learned matters of aggada such as Midrash Rabbah and Ein Yaakov that, in truth, are good ‎for young men, like appetizers before the main course. They will also be glorious and beautiful in ‎the ears of those who hear[from him] a particular peshat or derash, or when he hears a talk from a ‎great[scholar] he will loudly interject and make known his knowledge and grasp [of the subject], ‎by which he [himself] will become known as a distinguished scholar. After all that, perhaps he will ‎find a wife and find goodness, wealth and riches. However, this would be neither the proper path ‎nor the proper city, nor is it the definition of a true scholar who has acquired wisdom, and grown to ‎the point that we would hope he would be able to render good and just rulings in Israel, who is ‎filled with the meat and wine of the [more] substantial matters of Torah.
Concerning the ‎‎[management of the] stages [of your son's learning], this is a difficult matter for an individual –‎‎ even‏ ‏one who is wealthy and distinguished – To‏ ‏manage for his son. [And this would be‏ ‏the case ‎as well] even if one were to find a‏ ‏distinguished scholar who would teach for‏ ‏the sake of heaven, ‎without deception and‏ ‏for whom personal gain and reward is not‏ ‏all they have in mind. This ‎already is‏ ‏uncommon, and it may not even exist, but‏ ‏even if‏ ‏you were to look and find [you would ‎face another difficulty].‎‏ ‏All who have children who go to‏ ‏school‏ ‏adopt a manner of learning that is ‎not‏ ‏proper – so what could one local [teacher] do, to go against his colleagues and‏ ‏change [this ‎system] and adopt a proper‏ ‏approach against his peers? And even if one's father would hire a ‎teacher for him[alone], is not the greatest need in study‏ ‏the bond with friends, as it is written‏ ‏‎(Taanit 7a) “[I have learned] more from my‎‏ ‏friends than my teachers”? There is no‏ ‏solution for ‎this, unless one were to‏ ‏gather together five or six heads of household and hire a teacher for their‏ ‏sons, on condition that none could be‏ ‏added. They would provide [for the‏ ‏teacher] as befits him, ‎as though he had‏ ‏double the students. Then, Divine counsel will be effective through this system ‎of learning.‎
