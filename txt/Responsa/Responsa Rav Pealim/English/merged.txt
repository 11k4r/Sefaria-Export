 There was a story with the one [person] who was the leader and did not pray the afternoon prayer until close to the end of its time [i.e. the allotted time for the prayer], and he measured in his mind that if he will pray now the afternoon prayer he will not be able to finish it entirely in its time, because certainly when he will reach the middle of his prayer of the Amida its time will be [already be] finished, and he will need to finish the prayer after its time, and the questioner was unsure if it is permitted for him to pray in this situation, even though he knows that he will have to finish the prayer after the time, or maybe since he is not able to pray all of the prayer in its time he should not pray now, but if he was forced [to miss the prayer] he should wait to pray the evening prayer twice after it is certainly dark, and if he was intentional [in missing the prayer]  indeed he would lose the prayer. And this doubt that the questioner asked, behold one time with myself there was an event, that I measured in the middle of the Amida [of the afternoon prayer] that the entire time of bein hashmashot [the time of  which we are unsure whether it is day or night] will certainly pass, and I said to look [in]to this [matter], with the help of Heaven.
