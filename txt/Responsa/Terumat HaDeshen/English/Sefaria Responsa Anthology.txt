Question: Townspeople or officers summoned him, or he went to them on his own, due to a debt he owes non-Jews. They discussed matters of dispute and compromise at length, and he could not excuse himself from them without losing the debt. He had to drink with them, until the time for praying Minha elapsed. In such a case, may he pray Ma’ariv twice or not?
Answer: It seems to me that he may indeed pray Ma’ariv twice, even though the great ones have written: “If one purposefully did not pray one of the prayers in its proper time, there is no make-up prayer (tashlumin), for something that is crooked cannot be fixed.”  It seems to me that the present case would not be considered purposeful (mezid), and is similar to one who is compelled. This is inferred from the beginning of the chapter “Elu Megalhin” (Mo’ed Katan 14a): “What is the law if he lost something? Do we say that since he must seek it out, he is considered compelled (oneis)?” We see from here that whenever one neglects a mitzva to prevent loss of money is considered compelled. It further states in the first chapter of Berakhot: “Beware of a Torah scholar who forgot his learning because he was compelled.” Rashi explains: “He was ill or preoccupied with working because foot is scarce.” Mordechai, in the first chapter of Shabbat, in the name of Rabbeinu Tam regarding the passage that forbids setting sail [before Shabbat], distinguishes someone who is traveling for the sake of a mitzva from one who is traveling a voluntary matter (devar reshut). A voluntary matter refers to one who is traveling for pleasure; if one is traveling for commerce, to earn a living, it is considered traveling for a mitzva. All of this implies that, in the present case, he is not considered to be acting purposefully, even though we can make a distinction: with regard to prayer, which is worship of the Creator, he should not be worried about the loss of his money. It is even said about Torah scholars that they keep the times of study and the times of prayer separate, and it is stated in Avot (2:1): “Calculate the reward of a mitzva against its costs.” So granted, he did not act appropriately; nevertheless, this is not called “purposeful.” It is akin to one who erred or was unwitting about his prayer, who indeed may make it up. It is further stated in the chapter “Tefilat Ha-shahar”: “Shmuel’s father and Levi were walking on the road. They arose early and prayed.” Rashi explains: “They prayed before dawn.” At first glance, it is implied that they were traveling voluntarily, for their own needs, yet they would pray, even ab initio, outside the prescribed time. Even according to Tosafot ad loc., which explains that they prayed after dawn but before sunrise, the primary time for prayers is only after sunrise, and nevertheless they forsook the primary time for prayer for the sake of their business dealings, even ab initio. Thus, we may say that ex post facto one is not called a sinner and purposeful if he misses the entire interval to avoid losing money. Rosh wrote ad loc.: “Rabbeinu Hananel ruled in accordance with Shmuel’s father and Levi.” Even though Halakhot Gedolot ruled against this, that may have been for a different reason, namely, that [the blessing of] redemption should immediately precede prayer (mismakh ge’ula le-tefila). Moreover, Rosh wrote that R. Hananel’s position stands to reason.

R. Eliezer b. Shalom and R. Gershom b. Shalom came before me in a case. R. Eliezer screamed at R. Gershom that he stabbed him and shoved him on the holiday of Sukkot, during the hoshanot circuits, with intent to harm him, as he hated him for a long time. [R. Eliezer] was shoved so much that the bones of his shoulder broke, and he required a doctor to heal him. R. Gershom retorted that he made the circuits like everyone else, and it is normal to push and shove at that time. If he shoved him, it happened without intent to harm him. They continued to fight before me. I also saw all of the testimonies, and after scrutinizing them I found no clear testimony that R. Eliezer was pushed by R. Gershom. I saw only deductions and implications within the testimonies. However, one witness testified that R. Gershom said to him the night before the shoving incident that he had in mind to shove R. Eliezer the next day. He also said to him as they left the synagogue, “Why did you not come to the aid of your landlord when he was shoved?” This testimony was clearer than all the other testimonies. Nevertheless, if we were to exhaust the full depth of Torah law, this testimony would not be sufficient. R. Gershom’s statement to the witness on the previous night, we can say, was because people are prone to boasting without acting, as we see in the chapter “Hezkat Ha-batim” (Bava Batra 33b), in the case of one who went and chopped down another’s date palm.  Even what he said after leaving the synagogue, as above, was an admission outside of the rabbinical court, was autonomously volunteered, and was not in the presence of his accuser, so it is entirely ineffective, as explained by Or Zaru’a [in comments on] the beginning of Bava Metzi’a. R. Gershom cannot be punished or convicted on the basis of deductions and implications, for we accept the ruling of the anonymous first Tanna who disagrees with R. Aha in the chapter “Ha-mokher Peirot” (Bava Batra 93a) in the of an ox that was grazing by the river and a dead ox was found by its side. Even though one was gored and the other was wont to gore, we do not say, “This one gored that one.” This is the ruling of Rif in the chapter “Ha-para” (chapter 5 of Bava Kamma). Certainly in the present case we need stronger indications that there was intention to cause harm, for if he did not intend to cause harm, even if [the victim] was certainly harmed by him, [the perpetrator] is completely exempt from culpability, since the harm came at a time of joy over a mitzva, as Or Zaru’a and Rosh state ad loc., and as Tosafot state at the end of Sukkah. Yet I see, and my heart tells me, that a matter like this needs a major safeguard and protective fence, for if one man can ambush another at such a place, the mitzva of the circuits will be annulled due to each man’s fear of being harmed by someone who hates him. If one bodily injures his fellow at that time, his sin is greater than if he would do so at a different time and place, firstly because he degrades the sanctity of the synagogue, and secondly because he does God’s commandment by means of a transgression. Worse, during this time, on the podium is the Torah scroll, in which it states “do not add” [blows to the prescribed number of lashes], which the Sages interpreted to mean that even if a Jew is wicked, one who strikes him once he has accepted his punishment commits a transgression. One must not conquer the queen while the king is in the house. Since it is apparent and evident that R. Gershom intended to strike and hurt R. Eliezer bodily, and in all such cases, a rabbinical court may punish even in a manner that is not prescribed by law, I hereby impose that R. Gershom express regret and ask forgiveness. He shall do the following: On a day when the Torah is read, while the Torah scroll is on the podium, he should walk from his space to R. Eliezer’s space, passing in front of the ark. The community notables should go with him. He shall say to R. Eliezer: “Eliezer, I have sinned to the God of Israel and then to you, for I have degraded the sanctity of the synagogue and the commandments of the Almighty, and I have violated the Torah’s admonition against striking and hurting another bodily. I therefore ask for pardon and atonement from the God of Israel, and then forgiveness from you, for I regret what I have done. I have estimated the doctor’s fees on average. R. Gershom shall give R. Eliezer two gold coins, and R. Eliezer shall give away those two gold coins, with the knowledge of two trusted men, in honor of the synagogue in Graetz (=Slovenj-Gradec, Slovenia), for a mitzva of his choosing, since they are being given to him as a penalty and to reinforce safeguards, as I explained above. Therefore, I did not impose any charges due to time lost from work, since it is not as clear as the doctor’s fees, for which it is known that R. Eliezer will have to spend money. So says the youngest and most insignificant in all of Israel.
