Rashi on Chagigah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

<b> Mishna - "All are obligated in the appearance"</b> in the command in the appearing of <i>all your males</i> (Shemos 23:16) - that it they need to be seen in the Temple Courtyard on the Festival.
<b>Except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> - that they are not of sound mind and they are exempt from commandments.
<b> The Lame and the Blind </b> - all of these are learned from verses in the Gemara.
<b>And one who is unable to ascend on his legs </b> - from Jerusalem until the Temple Courtyard. And the Gemara explains this (passage).

Line 2

1. <b> Which minor etc. </b> - but from then and on <small>(i.e after he is after to ride on his father's shoulders etc.)</small> even though he is not obligated from the Torah, the Sages placed on his father and his mother to train him in commandments.
2. <b> Three times (regalim) </b> - one who is fit to ascend on his feet (regel) <small>[Translator: Regel means time but also feet in Biblical Hebrew]</small> the verse obligates, and since that an adult is exempt from the Torah (who is unable to walk themselves), (similarly) a minor is not subject to training (in the same scenario).

Line 3



Line 4

[Regarding] the annulment of vows about which the Sages said that a sage may annul a vow, there is [only] a scant hint in Scripture, so it does not have what to be based upon. Rather, such was passed on the Sages in the Oral Law.

Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

From that it states, "in My wrath," it implies that I can ask about [its annulment] - as it was because of My wrath, and I did not swear with a calm mind. We can learn from here that we annul [the vow] for one who finds a hole in his vow, sayin, "I did not make the vow with this in mind - that what I see coming to me because of my vow, would come to me."

Line 8


Since it states, "I shall fulfill it," it implies that if he wanted not to fulfill it, we annul it for him.
