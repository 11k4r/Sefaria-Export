Line 4

[Regarding] the annulment of vows about which the Sages said that a sage may annul a vow, there is [only] a scant hint in Scripture, so it does not have what to be based upon. Rather, such was passed on the Sages in the Oral Law.

Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

From that it states, "in My wrath," it implies that I can ask about [its annulment] - as it was because of My wrath, and I did not swear with a calm mind. We can learn from here that we annul [the vow] for one who finds a hole in his vow, sayin, "I did not make the vow with this in mind - that what I see coming to me because of my vow, would come to me."

Line 8


Since it states, "I shall fulfill it," it implies that if he wanted not to fulfill it, we annul it for him.
