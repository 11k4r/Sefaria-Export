Rashi on Kiddushin



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

To her husband
As we will explain later on, "and these three are in female form." And the Gemara will ask why it's taught in feminine form.
Our printing: And she "acquires" herself in two ways
To be within her rights to marry another 
The Braisa explains in the Gemara (5b), [acquisition with money:] give her money or money-equivalent and say to her, "behold you are betrothed to me." Document: write it for her on paper, even though the paper is not worth a prutah, [say,] "behold you are betrothed to me." Through intercourse: come upon her and say "betroth me with this intercourse." All of this is learned from the [written] Torah. 
Beit Shammai's reasoning is explained in the Gemara (11a)
of copper
of silver and its value is eight prutas. 

Line 2

To the deceased husband's widow [yavam]
To be his wife for all matters, for if he came to divorce her afterward, she does not need from him halitza rather a bill of divorce [get]. But money or a document do not have the effect of betrothing her from the Torah, rather from the Sages as they instituted an order, as they say in Yevamot. But (money or a document) do not finalize the betrothal to allow him to inherit from her or become impure for her and do not exempt from halitza, rather they make her forbidden to the other brothers.

Line 3

1 . And what's the difference there--In the second chapter (41a) where it says "the man betroths himself or with his agent," let it say here: the woman becomes betrothed
2. Because it needs to teach money--that with [money] we aquire, and we said previous (4b) "from where do we know that we can acquire with money," and we explain that we learn "take" "take" from the Field of Efron that we consider it an acquisition. Therefore we learn here that [money] can acquire.

Daf 3b



Line 1

It does not acquire her soul - it is a disgrace to her; therefore the method of chalifin is abolished for her when doing kiddushin. And even with a vessel whose worth is greater than that of a pruta, if you bring it to her with the language of chalifin [it does not acquire her soul] until he brings her according to the laws with the language of acquisition or buying or kiddushin.

He received support for the matter - While he was bent before him, that he understood the study of one Mizmor in the book of Psalms that he had not understood beforehand to explain it. And some interpret that he only expounded one - (Psalm 79) Mizmor L'Asaf, "God, the nations invaded your inheritance," - It should have stated Kinah L'asaf, Lament for Asaf. He expounded such that Asaf says a song on the fact that God consumed His anger on wood and stone that was in His house, and because of this exonerated the survivors in Israel, for were it not for this, Israel [lit. the enemies of Israel] would not have left any survivors. And this is what it says, (Lamentations 4:11) “The Lord has spent His fury, He has poured out His fierce anger, and He has kindled a fire in Zion.”

'The best of doctors is to gehenna' - They do not fear disease. They eat the food of the healthy, and they do not act humbly before God. Sometimes they kill, and sometimes they are able to heal a poor person but do not do so.
