Rashi on Bava Metzia



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

1 Two are grasping the garment - The Mishnah is specifically talking about when the two men are grasping the garment.  Because they both have physical claim to it. And neither have a stronger hold than the other, because if only one person was holding it.  The other person would have to bring a proof that it is his with witnesses, and he wouldn't be allowed to take it after swearing.
2 This one said it is all mine - The gemora will explain why it taught it twice.
3 This one swears - The gemora will explain why he takes oath.
4 That he doesn't have less than half - The gemora will explain what it helps if he swears in this manner. 

Line 2



Line 3

There were 2 riding... To teach that Riding and leading both of them are equal in terms of acquiring an animal out of ownerlessness. 

Line 4



Line 5



Line 6

Before that it was picked up
Like that was learned, Divide it!
With complete control I picked it up first and you came and you grabbed it from my possession and I'm the one who really deserves it. 

Line 7


Find it indicates it come into ones hands.... And even with this, we are refering to a Jew and not an idolater. So that you should not say " When did the Torah exclude Goyim from having their lost items returned to them? When that they are not in the hands of a Jew that is when you don't have to struggle to return the lost object. But when the lost item comes into ones hands your obligated to return it and his lost object is forbidden for you to keep".

Regarding hospitality - If people ask him if his host received him well. Answer them "no." This is a good character trait in order to prevent undesirable guests from inundating him [the host] and exhausting his resources.

Line 1

In the days of Rabi this Mishna was said- ...When the students of Shamai and Hillel that were before him three generations increased, disputes about Torah proliferated and it became like two Torahs. [this was] because of the yoke of bondage of exile and the decrees that were decreed upon them and because of this they were not able to focus on clarifying the disputes until the days of Rabi, who God gave him the ability to charm Antoninus the King of Rome....and they were able to rest from their troubles and he sent for and gathered all of the students of Israel and until his day there were no organized tractates rather every student that heard something from the mouth of someone greater than him taught it to others and made signs for it and said such and such a law I heard from such and such a person. and when they gathered every person said what they learned and they worked on  verifying the reasons for the dispute and understanding who's words are worthy of being kept and they organized the tractates; the words of  Nezikin (damages) on their own...the words of Kodashim (holy things) on their own....

One needs the knowledge of the owners - and if he [the shomer] did not inform them he is obligated to be responsible for them if it died or was stolen, because from when he took it [the sheep or the sela] it enters his ownership and an act of returning it without knowledge of the owners is not [considered] an act of returning.
