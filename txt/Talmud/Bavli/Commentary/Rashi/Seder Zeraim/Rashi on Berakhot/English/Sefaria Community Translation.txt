Rashi on Berakhot



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

From what time do we read the shema at night? From the time that the Kohanim (priests) enter to eat their Trumah (holy food).     Kohanim that became defiled, and then immersed (in the mikvah), and the sun has set [reseting their purity], then they are allowed to eat Trumah.
UNTIL THE END OF THE FIRST WATCH-  A third of the night, as will be explained in the Gemara (p. 3a), and from then on the time has passed for it is not the time of lying down, and is not referred to in the words "Bishachbicha".  Also, before this period is not considered the time for lying down.  Therefore, if one read the Shema before, he does not fulfill his obligation.  If so, why do we read the Shema in the Synagogue?  In order to stand in Tefilah, in connection with words of Torah as is taught in the Briata in the Jerusalem Talmud Berachot.  Therefore one would have to read again after it gets dark.  [In this case] Reading the first section of the Shema at bed time suffices.

Line 2



Line 3

Until dawn - The entire night is called the time of laying down.

Line 4



Line 5

The Burning of the fats and limbs - Of the sacrifices that their blood is sprinkled during the day. 
Their commandment - is to be brought the entire night and they do not become invalidated through "sleeping" until the morning star rises
Fats - of all (types) of sacrifices
Limbs - of a burnt offering
And all (offerings) which must be eaten that same day - for example sin offerings and guilt offerings and the lambs of atzeres and meal offerings and thanksgiving offerings
Their commandment - ie the allotted time for their being eaten 
Until Dawn - And this is what brings them to become Nossar (leftover) as it says with the Todah Sacrifice "A person should not leave anything over until morning" and all of this is learnt from the Todah sacrifice.
If so why did the sages say until midnight - This is regarding Kerias Shema and eating Kodshim.

Line 6

How is this possible - From where does the Tanna conclude the obligation to read Kerias Shema, that he began to ask here the time of reading?

Line 7



Line 8

On the text it is based - And there you can learn the obligation of reading (Shema)

Ke'Hizra - [like] a staff in the hand of a person who strikes the staff downward in one motion (i.e. so the staff parallel to the ground).
Straightens (from the bow) Ke'Hivya - pleasantly, first his head, and the rest of his body afterwards, so his bow does not appear to be a burden upon him.
Ke'Hivya - like a snake that, when he straightens himself, lifts his head first, and then straightens himself gradually.

Line 2

The Holy King - since during these days He shows his kingship to judge the world
The king of the Justice - like "King of Justice". Just as "the carriers of the ark of the covenant" is like "ark of the covenant". Another example is "the insets of the laver stands" which is like "insets of the laver stands". Similarly, "the valley of the corpses" is like "valley of the corpses".

in chapters -- between the breaks, and vita supra it differentiates in our Mishna between [the break between] the first chapter and the second and that between the second and the Sh'ma, etc.
Queries out of respect -- queries in greeting a man of honor, that it is appropriate to anticipate them in greeting [without first being greeted].
And responds -- greeting if he anticipated him, and in the Gemara it explains that if he queries, it is obvious he responds.
And in the middle -- in the middle of the blessing or the paragraph.
Out of fear -- a man who is afraid before them, that they do not kill him, but not on account of honor.

Between "He said" and "true and stalwart" do not break -- in the Gemara is explained their reason.

Line 21

"And it will be that if you listen" our practice is both by day and by night -- for it discusses the teaching of Torah, for it is written: "and you will teach them to your sons."
"he said" our practice is only by day -- for it discusses the tzitzis, which our practice is only by day, for it is written: "And you will see them," to exclude the cover of night.

His characteristics... His Mitzvoth.

And Rav Huna said: What is taught, "He is permitted water and salt, but forbidden any other food and drink," could not be referring to one who says "Food is forbidden to me" because "food " only refers to the five species of grain: wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. Rather it refers to one who says, "Everything nourishing  is forbidden to me," and all things, granted they are not called "food" but they surely "nourish," except for water and salt. Therefore oil nourishes.

When it arrived time to mishrei -- from "shirusa," viz. to "break" the blessing of "The Extractor [of bread from the Land" and to eat.

Line 2

R. Huna, that of Babylonia -- this is R. Huna of the s'tam, and because now R. Zeira is in the Land of Israel in place of R. Abahu. And it is Ullah from Babylonia saying this.

His effects -- lands

Line 7

Until where is the Zimmun blessing? -- that they need to be three, and when they are two they do not say it.

Line 8



Line 9

The Zimmun blessing is two and three -- at times they are two blessings; at times they are three. How so? When they are three is when they are three blessings and when they are two they are two blessings, as it is explained and goes on.
as he holds -- the Zimmun blessing until "The Feeder" and when they are two they do not say except the blessing of "the Land" and "Builder of Jerusalem."
And the one who said "three and four" -- when they are two, hark, they are three: "The Feeder" and the blessing of "the Land" and "Builder of Jerusalem." And when they are three, they add, blessing until "And of his good we live."

Line 10



Line 11

They establish for him -- We do not have this version. And this is our version: "And yet it was taught, "two and three in the blessing of laborers, who say the blessing of "the Land" and "Builder of Jerusalem" in one blessing. There is naught here but one blessing of "The Feeder" and the blessing of "the Land" and when they are three they add, "we bless" -- hark, three.
For Sir said -- supra, in two second chapter.

Line 12



Line 13



Line 14

For hark he opens with "Blessed" -- and if it is Biblical, it is close to its fellow and we do not open with "Blessed."
As it was taught etc. there are of them etc. -- Like the blessings of fruits and commandments one opens and does not close, and the reason is explained in "Arv(ei) Pesahim" [Pesahim 105a] becausee all of them are one appreciation, and there is no break or other matter between, as there is in Kiddush. 

Daf 46b



Line 1

And some of them close but do not open -- like a blessing which is close to its fellow which already opened. In the first blessing and the final blessing of the reading of Sh'ma, "True and stalwart" and "Truth and belief" that even though the reading of the Sh'ma breaks them up the blessings which were before rely on them, are for them "close to their  fellow."
Who is the good and makes good etc. -- which is not close to its fellow, which is not the blessing on victuals but on the grave of those killed at Beitar they mandated it.

Line 2

For hark they were uprooting it in a house of morning -- according to R"A.
