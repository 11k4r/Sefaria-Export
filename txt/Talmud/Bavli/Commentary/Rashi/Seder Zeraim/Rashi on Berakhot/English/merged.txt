Rashi on Berakhot



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

From what time do we read the shema at night? From the time that the Kohanim (priests) enter to eat their Trumah (holy food).     Kohanim that became defiled, and then immersed (in the mikvah), and the sun has set [reseting their purity], then they are allowed to eat Trumah.
UNTIL THE END OF THE FIRST WATCH-  A third of the night, as will be explained in the Gemara (p. 3a), and from then on the time has passed for it is not the time of lying down, and is not referred to in the words "Bishachbicha".  Also, before this period is not considered the time for lying down.  Therefore, if one read the Shema before, he does not fulfill his obligation.  If so, why do we read the Shema in the Synagogue?  In order to stand in Tefilah, in connection with words of Torah as is taught in the Briata in the Jerusalem Talmud Berachot.  Therefore one would have to read again after it gets dark.  [In this case] Reading the first section of the Shema at bed time suffices.

Line 2



Line 3

Until dawn - The entire night is called the time of laying down.

Line 4



Line 5

The Burning of the fats and limbs - Of the sacrifices that their blood is sprinkled during the day. 

Fats - of all (types) of sacrifices
Limbs - of a burnt offering

Line 1

Ke'Hizra - [like] a staff in the hand of a person who strikes the staff downward in one motion (i.e. so the staff parallel to the ground).
Straightens (from the bow) Ke'Hivya - pleasantly, first his head, and the rest of his body afterwards, so his bow does not appear to be a burden upon him.
Ke'Hivya - like a snake that, when he straightens himself, lifts his head first, and then straightens himself gradually.

And Rav Huna said: What is taught, "He is permitted water and salt, but forbidden any other food and drink," could not be referring to one who says "Food is forbidden to me" because "food " only refers to the five species of grain: wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. Rather it refers to one who says, "Everything nourishing  is forbidden to me," and all things, granted they are not called "food" but they surely "nourish," except for water and salt. Therefore oil nourishes.
