People are are required to guard the Pesach flour from the time of harvesting it for the verse states "You will guard the Matzot" and Rava told those who cut the stalks, "when you cut them, cut them for the purpose of matza" which means, be careful that no water should come on them, meaning the bundles of stalks.
