If he did not talk he says one blessing, if he talked he says two - Rashi explains: If he did not talk he says one blessing - for both that of the hand and that of the head. If he talked, he says two blessings - "To lay the Tefillin" for that of the hand, and "concerning the precept of Tefillin" for that of the head. But Rabbeinu Tam explained: If he did not talk, he says one blessing - On that of the head he says (only one blessing) for that of the head: "Concerning the precept of tefillin," because that is its blessing. If he spoke he says two blessings - for that of the head: "to lay" and "concerning the precept of." And it is also written like this in the Shimusha Rabba D'Tfillin. This is the teaching of my teacher and master.
