Line 1

It was taught in a Mishna: They are four days in the year that serve as the new year. In every Mishnaic instance (when things are enumerated and then subsequently listed) it says "they are" (hen) as is found here as well as ( Shevuot 49a) "They are four types of guards" and (Chullin 17b) "They are three types of knicks"
