<b>Mishnah - <i>Elu Metziot Shelo</i>:</b> Bundles in a public area -  It is specifically with bundles that it distinguishes between a public area and a private area: <b>As according</b> to the one that holds (later, on Bava Metzia 22b) that an identifying mark that is prone to be trampled is [considered] an identifying mark, and that a place is an identifying mark - it is speaking here when there is no identifying mark; and the place is also not an identifying mark in a public area, because they roll around. But the place is an identifying mark in a private area - such that one would be obligated to announce [them when they are found there]. And that is speaking about when it is found in the manner of  being placed down (intentionally). But bread of a baker and round cakes of figs do not have an identifying mark, so they are [the finder's] even in a private area. And that is speaking about when he found it in the manner of [something] being dropped - hence the place is not an identifying mark. And if you will say, "Why does it mention bundles, in the manner of being placed down, more than the other [cases] - about which it is speaking in the manner of being dropped" - one can say that because the bundles are expensive, they would not have been dropped without his awareness (he would be more mindful about them). Rather, [the case would be] that when he stopped to rest, he placed them on the ground and forgot them there. However, the bread [from the kitchen] of a homeowner has an identifying mark, for homeowners are accustomed to make an identifying mark on their bread. Hence even [if they were found] in a public area, one is obligated to announce [them] - for an identifying mark that is prone to be trampled is [considered] an identifying mark. And [the reason] that the place is an identifying mark with piles of fruit or piles of money even in a public place - as it says later on - is because rolling around is not applicable to them. And if you will say, "How can [finders] take bundles in a public place when it is speaking about [them being found in] the manner of being placed down - behold, we say later that one may not take [an object when there is] a doubt that it was placed down, and all the more so [when it is] certain" - one can say that those words (that case) is when he finds [it] in a hidden and guarded place, such that he should not take it if there is no identifying mark; and if there is an identifying mark, he takes [it] and announces [it]. <b>And according</b> to the one that holds (later, on Bava Metzia 22b) that an identifying mark that is prone to be trampled is not [considered] an identifying mark, and that a place is also not an identifying mark - it is speaking about bundles that have an identifying mark. And hence one announces it [when it was found] in a private area. But the bread of the baker and the rest of [the cases in] our mishnah do not have an identifying mark. And hence they are his, even [if they were found] in a private area. However, he is obligated to announce the bread [from the kitchen] of a homeowner that has an identifying mark, even [when found] in a public place - as it is not something that is prone to be trampled, since we do not pass by food [without picking it up]. And our entire mishnah is speaking about whether [the object] was [found] in the manner of being dropped or whether it was in the manner of being placed down. And if you will say, "If the bundles were in the manner of being dropped, hence [the one who dropped them] does not know where they are; so why does he need to announce [them] - behold [the owner has abandoned them, since he believes that they fell in the public area" - one can say that even though he is not able to determine the place [where he dropped it], he knows whether it fell in a public area or a private area.

Line 11

And how much? Rabbi Yitzchak says, "One <i>kav</i> in four [by four] cubits" - and it must be said that Rabbi Yitzchak himself inquired, "And how much?" For if the gemara inquired, "And how much," let it establish [the case as being in] the manner of  being dropped, and even more [than a <i>kav</i>] - as the gemara challenges after this. Rather [the question] is from the words of Rabbi Yitzchak. And Rabbi Yitzchak may not establish [the case to be] in the manner of being dropped and even more, because he holds - like Abbaye - that abandonment without intention is not [considered] abandonment. Rather, he establishes it to be in the gathering [of grain] on the threshing floor, such that he left them there intentionally. And likewise in this way is it found in our chapter (Bava Metzia 30b) that when it inquires, "And forever? Rav Yehuda [answers], etc." - it must be said that Rav Yehudah said, "And forever?" And likewise in the chapter [entitled] <i>Lo Yachpor</i> (Bava Batra 22b, and Tosafot there, s.v. and how much) concerning distancing from windows, such that it says, "And how much? Rav Yeiva said, 'The full width of the window.'"

Line 12



Line 13



Line 14

A half-<i>kav</i> in an area of two cubits, what is [the law] - It is a wonder: Is a <i>kav</i> in four cubits not also a half-<i>kav</i> in two cubits (is the ratio not the same); so what is he inquiring? And one can say that since there is only a half-<i>kav</i>, he will take [them] since there is no exertion [beyond this] to finish. But [with] a <i>kav</i> in four cubits, since there is exertion to take all of it, he does not take [them] at all. Or also (another answer), a <i>kav</i> in four by four cubits is [the same as] half a <i>kav</i> in two cubits width by four cubits length, whereas here he is inquiring about two cubits by two cubits.

Because when it fell, he does not despair (abandon it) - And even though, he abandons it now, it is a general coincidence; and he was not prepared to abandon them as first.

Come and hear, one who finds coins, etc. - It is a wonder: Since it already brought a difficulty from our mishnah about scattered coins, why does it also challenge from this baraita? And also why did Rabbi Yitzhak not say his piece about our mishnah? And it can be said that it was stronger for it to raise a difficulty on the baraita, since it implies that it is the [finder's] in all cases - even in the case where there is an identifying mark, since it establishes the reason to be because the multitudes are found there. And it is also implied [that this is the case] even though the owner of the lost object was still in the study hall when [the finder] picked it up, and he didn't know that it had fallen from him. 

Line 11



Line 12



Line 13

And exempt from tithes - In Tractate Peah 4:1, it is shown that it is only when he renders it ownerless before the end of the work [on the produce] that it is exempt from tithes. But if he renders it ownerless after the end of the work, when he was already obligated in tithes, there is nothing in this. And here too is it is speaking about after the end of the work, such that they have not yet dried - as it is shown in Beitzah 34b, the chapter [entitled] Hamevie - that the end of the work of figs that are ready to be spread out in the field and to be made into dried figs, is not until they are dried. And even if the finder claimed them before they dried, they are [still] exempt from tithes, as we say in Bava Kamma 28a, "One who renders his vineyard ownerless and arose early in the morning and harvested it [...] is exempt from tithes." But it is not like this concerning consecrated property (<i>hekdesh</i>). As if he consecrated [it] before the end of the work and it was redeemed before the end of the work, it is [still] obligated in tithes, as it is somewhat shown in the chapter [entitled] HaOmer (Kiddushin 62b). 

Line 14

The fig tree, too, one knows that [the figs] fell - The explantion: Granted, [in the case of] the fig trees, [taking the figs is] permissible - since it is common that they fall, [the owner] abandons them from the beginning. For he thinks that the finder will take them, for [the latter] did not know that it fell from a tree, but rather thinks that it fell from passers-by. But with olives and carobs, it is forbidden, for they are not prone to falling. Even though if [the owner knew that it fell], he would abandon [it] - as passers-by would take [it], since they would assume that it fell from [other] passers-by. [But] now that they did not know, they would think [the olives or carobs] did not fall - [so] it would be forbidden, as it would be abandonment without awareness. But according to Rava, why would it be forbidden? And if you will say, "If it is the law to assume [the fruit came from] passers-by, and not from the tree adjacent to it, why is it forbidden with olives and carobs" - one can say that according to the law, we certainly do not assume [it was] from passers-by, but from the tree; however, the owners will abandon [the fruit nevertheless], as they think that passers-by who are not upstanding will decide upon a dispensation for the fruit that they find, and assume they were from passers-by. And if you will say, "If so, what is the challenge it presents to Rava; let us say that olives and carobs are forbidden because even after the owners know that they fell, they do not abandon [them], since they know that the finder will not take them; as he will assume that they fell from the tree, as is the truth, since one should not assume [they were] from passers-by - one can say, if they do not abandon [them in the case of] the fig tree, why would [the figs] be permitted? However there are books [of the Talmud] that have the variant, "an olive is different, since its olive tree (<i>zaito</i>) proves about it." For with this, that which we raised as a difficulty is answered. That is to say that since they are below the olive tree, the owners will think that the finder will not take them, to assume [them] from passers-by. But "a fig becomes disgusting with its fall" - the explanation is, it gets dirty and is disgusting to him, so he renders it ownerless. But in most books, we have the variant, "since its appearance (<i>chazuto</i>) proves about it; and even though the olives fall, [the finder] knows that the place of a person is that person's" - the explanation is, olives that fell are similar to olives [still] standing on the tree; and therefore even when the owners know they fell, they will not abandon [them], as they know that the ones that find them will not take them. But "a fig dissolves (<i>nimiset</i>) with its fall" - this is the variant in Arukh - <i>nimiset</i> without an aleph - so they are not similar to those on the tree. And also we can follow the variant [that has] <i>nimaeset</i> (becomes disgusting) - and because it becomes dirty, it is not similar to a fig on the tree.

The Gemara uses this particular language because of Bat Sheva was a doubtfully married woman. Rashi interpreted that it is because ever man who went to one of David’s wars signed a Gett, on the condition that if he dies, she will be expelled and she would not require יבום (divorce), and all of the days he is out at war she would be considered doubtfully married. And this is a difficulty for Rabeinu Tam that if this is so, it is not “all men”, it is only if they had brothers and did not have children. However, Rashi is not particular when he says “יבום”, rather she will not be tied down (become an Agunah).

King Shapur -- The correct explanation appears to accord with Rashi (that King Shapur here refers to the actual King Shapur, not the sage Shemuel who is sometimes called King Shapur), for King Shapur was an expert in Jewish law, as it says at the end of Tractate Avodah Zarah (76b), that he stabbed the knife ten times into hard earth when he cut the citron with a knife for Rav Yehudah.
