Verses twice and translation (Targum, i.e. Aramaic translation) once - Some explain that the requirement [of reading a translation] applies to foreigners in their (native) language, as it is like (Aramaic) Targum that sometimes explains the verses. Because, just as the (Aramaic) Targum explains [the verses] to the Amei Ha'aretz (literally, "People of the Land"), so too, foreigners understand [the translation of the verses] through their native tongue. However, this does not appear [to be a correct], since the (Aramaic) Targum explains items that cannot be understood from the Hebrew, as can be found in many places. [For example], Rabbi Yosef said, (Megillah 3a) "If it were not for the (Aramaic) Targum of this verse, I would not know what it is speaking of." Therefore, one should not recite [the translation] in any language the third time (i.e. after the verses are read in Hebrew twice), except for the language of the (Aramaic) Targum.

In the Talmud Yerushalmi the reason is explained: Rabbi Boon said, it says "in order that you may remember [the day when you came out of the land of Egypt] all the days of your life"  - when you are engaged in life and not days when you are engaged with death. There is also a version which says 'exempt from reading the Shema and from prayer and from T'fillin."

Line 13

Line 16



Line 17


According to Rashi, you do not need to bless. And understand from his explanation that if one wants to bless, it is permitted. However, in the Yerushalmi it says, if you want to be stringent, we don't let him. Therefore, it appears to say, one does not bless and one is not permitted to bless, and the Yerushalmi explains why, and says because of Kavod HaMeit (respect for the dead). Alternatively, because he doesn't have anyone who will carry his burden. We ask a question: but isn't it taught in a Braita: exempt from netilat lulav. And should you think we are dealing with Yom Tov, and there he is not too busy to carry the burden, and we teach that it is referring to Chol, meaning Chol HaMoed [because he could potentially bury on Chol]. But isn't it taught in a Braita: 'Exempt from the blowing of the shofar'. It should have said on a weekday and not on Yom Tov. And that's a question. And we answer: Rav Chanina said, since he needs to prepare the casket and the shrouds [which the dead wear], as it is taught in a Mishnah: "you may violate the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds" its as if he is carrying the burden. Consequently, the implication is that on shabbat and yom tov you are not permitted to make blessings and pray since you are busy violating the boundary to bring him a casket and shrouds. But there is a question from the end where it says "on shabbat you make blessings and a mezuman.

Daf 26b



Line 1

If he erred and did not pray mincha on Friday etc.; He erred and did not pray mincha on shabbat he prays at arbit twice.  This is to say, on Saturday night, and he says havdalah in the first, etc.   Rabeinu Yehuda wrote that if he erred and did not mention Rosh Chodesh at mincha he should not pray an extra time in the evening, for what will this accomplish? He already prayed mincha, he just forgot to add [yaaleh ve'yavoh for] Rosh Chodesh. If so, he does not gain anything if he prays an extra time in the evening after Rosh Chodesh has ended, since he will not mention Rosh Chodesh [in the extra prayer], and he has already prayed Amida. And this is different than the case here, where one erred and did not pray mincha on shabbat [at all], where in the evening he prays an extra time using the Amida of a regular evening, since here he did not pray at all so at least he gains the extra amida when he prays after shabbat ends in the evening, even though he is not mentioning shabbat.  And if you will ask, isn't he praying more than required since on shabbat there were only seven blessings and he will pray 18? There is no reason to worry about this, since even on shabbat it would be appropriate to pray all 18, but this was not required because of the extra effort it would require. We find, then, that he gains the full extra prayer. But when he erred and did not mention Rosh Chodesh, he has already prayed, so praying an additional time on Saturday evening will yield nothing.  And similarly, if he prayed a regular weekday amida at mincha on shabbat, and did not mention shabbat, it would seem that he should not pray again Saturday evening since he already said the amida. However, Rav Alfas [the Rif] does not seem to maintain this position, and in this case even though he does not gain anything he requires an extra prayer. To quote him: "With regard to the statement 'make havdalah in the first one and not in the second one, and if you did not say havdalah in the first one but did say havdalah in the second one, the second counts but the first does not count', since he needed to say the second one first; since he did not say havdalah in the first one but said havdalah in the second one, he has shown his intention that the second one should be his normal prayer. Therefore, he must pray again another time for his make-up prayer so that the obligatory prayer precedes the make-up.  And if he said havdalah in both of them, even though he was not required to do so, he does not need to repeat. And if he did not say havdalah in either of them, we do not make him repeat, as we learn in a braita 'if on erred and did not say havdalah in He Who grants us wisdom, we do not make him repeat since he can say havdalah on the cup of wine'".  Therefore, we require him to pray again even though he will not gain anything additional the second time. This is what Rabbi Moshe Malavar concluded from the words of Rabbi Alfas.

Hence it is deduced that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of one engaged in prayer – whether in front of them, behind them or on the side of them.  The Teshuvat Geonim explain that that this is only if one is sitting idly, but if they are engaged in the recitation of Shema or something similar, even if they are sitting it is okay.

<b>We teach him not to bow.</b> And if you say, he'll bow, and what difference does it make? And it should be said, that he should not go and uproot the words of Sages, so the people won't say, everyone is as stringent as he wishes and there is no Rabbinic decree, and [therefore] we worry about <i>yuhara</i> [showing off].

Who hast sanctified us by His commandments, and hast commanded us to lay the Tefillin - since he starts by putting it on his arm, he should bless "to lay," but on that of the head he blesses "concerning the precept" and not "to lay," sind he already started and layed one of them. But in chapter Hakometz it says, "if he did not talk he says one blessing, if he talked he says two blessings." Rashi explained that it says so on both Tefillin, that he says one blessing on both of them if he did not talk in between them, but it is difficult to say that the two blessings of "to lay" and "concerning the precept" were only needed when he talked and did a transgression. Therefore Rabbeinu Tam explained that on that of the head, which is the finishing of the commandment and the main part, because it has four compartments and the letter Shin, he says on it (an additional blessing of) "on the precept," and this is (how it appears) in Shimusha Rabba, authored by the Ge'onim. And according to the explanation of Rabbeinu Tam regarding "if he talked he says two blessings," (it refers to) if he puts on that of the head alone, since they (the two Tefillin) do not hold back each other  (from letting the wearer fulfill a commandment from it), he says two blessings. And this that the Gemara doesn't mention that on that of the head he says two blessings, it is because it is not at all common to place one without placing the other, since Tefillin by one with an obligation is common. And Rabbeinu Tam explained like this in his Responsa, and Rabbeinu Elchanan, in his "Order of the enactment of prayer," wrote like this.
