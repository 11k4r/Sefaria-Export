A concealed gift - a hidden gift, to be explained
We do not collect with it - because perhaps he already gave it to an other, or that he only intended to make the other feel indebted. 
Go and hide - hide yourselves
This is the text: And there are those who say that Rav Yosef said: It is referring to a case in which the giver did not say to witnesses: Sit outdoors in the marketplace. He did not instruct them to write it in the marketplace or streets, but he simply said to them write it. 
In the marketplace and outside - write it for all to see. 
The difference between the two versions is in a case where his instructions were without specification - For he said to them write it, and he did not say go and hide, and he did not instruct them to write it in the marketplace and outside. According to the earlier version of Rav Yosef the deed without specification is valid, and according to the second version it is invalid, for he has to say to them write it in the marketplace, sign it outside. And in the commentary of Rabenu Chanan'el   the text is that he told them not to sit in the marketplace or outside. But this cannot be correct for in that case both versions of Rav Yosef would imply that an unspecified deed is valid. 

Daf 41a



Line 1

What if the deed is unspecified - Because there are two versions of Rav Yosef, and there is a difference in that one implies that an unspecified deed is invalid, and the other that it is valid, we ask here, on which one do we rely in the case the deed is unspecified, he did not tell them to sit in the marketplace and outside, and he did not tell them to go and hide, is this considered a concealed gift or not. And there are commentaries that relate the question to...but I do not agree...
We are not concerned - for it is not concealed and therefore valid.
We are concerned - that it is concealed and therefore we don not collect with it. But if it used to collect the gift is not returned. There was such an instance. And that is the reason that that Rav Ashi does not say that we do not collect, but that we are concerned, since it is a doubt and the land should remain where it is. 
And the Halakha is that we are concerned - We do not collect with it, and therefore he has to write within the deed: and this is what he told us: write it in the marketplace and sign it outside. And even though he did not say this, but they wrote this in the deed, it is as if he said it, for he wanted the deed to be written according to rabbinical regulations.

But Samuel said, The law of the land is the law - All taxes, tariffs, and customs of the lawmakers of kings, who regularly lead their kingdom, it is the law, for all the citizens have accepted the king's statutes and laws of their own free will. Therefore, it is a complete law, and one cannot retain ownership over the money that belongs to his fellow according to the decree of the king, for that is theft.

The time on the deed. For it is written at its beginning such and such day of Shabbat, Ploni asked us to witness and make an act of acquisition from me to Ploni my son, after my death. 
It supports it. That from time the gift started, for if you say otherwise, then the time in the deed was written for naught. But certainly it was written to tells us that it was acquired on that day. And thus the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi, for if he writes that he acquires it after death even though he does not write from today, for Rav says that the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi. And even though it is written in Gittin 85b, Rav made a ruling that divorces take effect when handed over, to exclude Rav Yossi who says it takes effect on the date on the deed. But it was not stated explicitly there in Gittin that Rav changed his mind from that which he stated that the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi.  But because it says that he made a ruling, it means that regarding divorces, since it does not involve an acquisition, for that reason he made a ruling to be more flexible because of the strict nature of sexual restrictions. But with regards to financial matters the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi. For one can say that Rav only said that the Halakha is according to Rav Yossi only for deeds that involve an acquisition. ...
