Daf 7a



Line 1



Line 2



Line 3

Mishna: Lest he engage in sexual intercourse with her on the way - since he has to make her drink in Jerusalem, at the Great Court, as [it says] below.
Trusted with regard to her - that he will not have sexual intercourse [with her].

Line 4

Gemara: They taught only - that which is stated in the mishna in Kiddushin: "but one woman may be secluded with two men".
Perhaps one will need etc. - here too, since she is forbidden to both, having two is insufficient, lest the husband or the emissary of the court need to relieve himself, etc.

Line 5

So that there are two witnesses with regard to her - if [the husband] will have sexual intercourse with her, they will testify against him at the Great Court, and they will not make her drink.


Line 6

They taught only - that a woman may seclude herself with two men.
And ten men carried - a married woman on bier outside the city, giving the impression that she was dead, in order to carry out illicit acts with her.

Line 7

That they know how to warn him - and tell him that according to the Torah, when the man is not clean of sin -- that is, when he has sexual intercourse with her after she is forbidden to him -- the water does not evaluate his wife.

Line 8

Her husband is trusted with regard to her - and it is not necessary to appoint witnesses for him.
A sota, who is by a prohibition - namely, "the first husband shall not," etc. [Deuteronomy 24:4], as we say in the first chapter of Yevamot [11b], "Rather, how do I establish the phrase: “After she was defiled” [Deuteronomy 24:4]? It comes to include a sota who secluded herself with another man.

Line 9

That provides - [namely,] that very hermeneutical technique through which you proved your position, it [itself] implies the rule which we are saying, that he requires witnesses.
A menstruating woman, who is forbidden by penalty of karet - he perceives to be more serious, and he will not have sexual intercourse with her.

Line 10



Line 11



Line 12

Because she has the ability to become permitted - when she becomes purified. Therefore his urges will not overcome him, since he is guaranteed [that she will be permitted to him] after a while.
Who does not have the ability to become permitted - if she is found to be defiled, and therefore his heart will pursue her.
Stolen - that is to say, his heart will pursue that which is forbidden to him.

Line 13



Line 14

And they refuted it - as was said, "because she has the ability to become permitted".

Line 15

[The opinion of Rabbi Yehuda] is the same as that of the first tanna - of the baraita.
"But [the Sages] said" - which Rabbi Yehuda does not agree with.

Daf 18a



Line 1

On two pages - like the pages of a Torah scroll, which are made as columns.

Line 2

If one wrote one letter and erased one letter - onto the water, and then wrote the next letter and erased it, until [in this way] completing [the text] in its entirety, as it is written "all this ritual" [Numbers 5:30] -- that it all be [together] as one.


Line 3

For her sake - in a scroll by itself, as it is written, "and he shall carry out with her" [Numbers 5:30] -- for her sake.
Also the erasure - into a cup be for her sake -- that it be evident that the erasure is for her sake.

Line 4



Line 5



Line 6

Administered to her to drink through fiber - which is hollow, the way babies drink.

Line 7



Line 8



Line 9

That has a curse with it - with one of [the oaths] it is written "with the curse of adjuration" [Numbers 5:21]. Later on it will explain what the circumstances are.

Line 10

 I administer an oath to you - with the name [of God], and he pronounces the name.
That you were not defiled - that you are telling the truth that you were not defiled -- that is an oath that does not have a curse with it.
As, if you were defiled, they will come upon you - [that is,] the water [will come upon you] "causing the belly to distend and the thigh to sag" etc. [Numbers 5:22] -- which is the curse.

Line 11

Rava said: the curse stands by itself etc. - there are an oath and a curse here [separately in Rav's formulation], both regarding the woman. However in the verse it is written "with the curse of adjuration" [Numbers 5:21] -- that the oath have the quality of a curse.
I administer an oath to you that if you were defiled, they will come upon you - so, now we have an oath [which includes] a curse [along with it] -- that he administers an oath which states that the curse will take effect.

Line 12

There is no oath - [administered] to the woman, but the verse states "and [the priest] shall administer the oath to the woman" [cf. Numbers 5:21].
I administer an oath to you that you were not defiled and that if you were defiled [all these curses] will come upon you - I administer an oath to you that what you said before us is truthful, that you were not defiled; and if you were defiled, the water will come upon you. Then the oath that she was not defiled will apply to the woman, as well as to the curse that will occur.


Line 13

Mishna. Amen on the curse etc. - therefore she is required to double it.
Neither betrothed nor married - he extends upon her, through the mechanism of the "extension of an oath", [an oath regarding] adultery from the period of betrothal, even though he had not expressed a warning [then]. This, then, is a reference to "extension of an oath" in the Torah.

Daf 18b



Line 1

Nor as a widow waiting for my yavam, nor when married - and if she was his yevamah and he married her and warned her, and she secluded herself, he can extend an oath onto her that she was not defiled while she was a "shomeret yavam". A "shomeret yavam" is one who is anticipating and waiting for her yavam to marry her through levirate marriage. ["Shomeret" is] in the sense of "and his father kept the matter in mind" [Genesis 37:11] and "You would not keep watch over my sin" [Job 14:16].
Amen that I did not become defiled - that is the acceptance of the oath; and if I did become defiled, let [the waters] come into me -- that is the acceptance of the curse, corresponding to the way that [the priest] administered the oath to her that was described earlier in the Gemara [Sotah 18a:12]: "I administer an oath to you that you were not defiled and that if you were defiled [all these curses] will come upon you". And this is the elaboration of [the clause] "amen on the oath; amen on the curse" that was stated in the beginning of the Mishna.


Line 2

Amen that I will not become defiled - that if she will become defiled after some time, the water will destabilize her after she becomes defiled, as is taught in the Baraita in the Gemara [Sotah 18b:12].

Line 3

Nor with regard to after she becomes divorced etc. - and even according to Rabbi Meir, who says that he does stipulate with her on future events.


Line 4

And became defiled - during the period in which she was divorced, since she is only forbidden to return to [her original husband] if she was married [to someone else] by betrothal -- when it says "Then the first husband who divorced her shall not take her [into his household] to become his wife again" [Deuteronomy 24:4], it is referring to after betrothal and marriage, as it says "and becomes [the wife] of another man, then this latter man rejects her" [Deuteronomy 24:2-3].

Line 5



Line 6

Gemara. Who committed adultery - while she was a widow awaiting her yavam.
She becomes forbidden to her yavam - just as a woman who commits adultery while married to her husband becomes forbidden to her husband.
From the fact that the mishna teaches "nor as a widow waiting for my yavam" - [from the fact that] he administers an oath to her regarding adultery that she may have committed while she was a widow awaiting her yavam.

Line 7

Granted, if you say - that if she committed adultery she is forbidden to him -- that is why he can stipulate through "extension [of an oath]" even regarding that adultery. But if you say that etc. ...

Line 8



Line 9

Betrothal does not take effect - for a woman who is forbidden by negative mitzva [alone] to the one who betroths her. But the Rabbis argue, and say that it is only with those [forbidden unions] punishable by karet where the betrothal does not take effect; but with those forbidden by negative mitzva [alone], [the betrothal] does take effect. Therefore according to Rabbi Akiva, [unions] forbidden by serious negative mitzvot are equated to [unions] punishable by karet with respect to the additional prohibitions devolving thereof, [such as the ruling that] the offspring [of such unions] is a mamzer. Regarding becoming prohibited to her husband, too -- just when one has sexual intercourse with a married woman, which is punishable by karet, the woman becomes forbidden to her husband, so too when one has sexual intercourse with a widow waiting for her yavam, which is forbidden [by the negative mitzva] "the wife of the deceased shall not become that of another party, outside the family" [Deuteronomy 25:5] -- she will become forbidden to her yavam. 
Is considered to be - with respect to unions forbidden by a negative mitzva
Like a woman forbidden to him - for which [the punishment would be] karet.

Line 10

Their first marriage - such as if he divorced her, remarried her, and then warned her and she secluded herself.
Concerning the marriage of his brother, what is the halakha - [do we] extend [the oath to include] adultery while married to his brother? Because that which was taught in the mishna -- "when I was betrothed, married, a widow waiting for my yavam or married [through levirite marriage]"  [Sotah 18a:13] -- was not referring to one woman whom the yavam would make drink and swear about [the period of] betrothal and marriage to [the husband's] brother, but rather was referring to individual cases: if it a husband who is making her drink, he can stipulate with her about [the time when she was] betrothed and married; if it is a yavam who married her who is making her drink, he can stipulate with her about [the time when she was] a widow waiting for her yavam and married [through levirite marriage].


Line 11

Therefore he may indeed stipulate with her concerning any case in which she would become forbidden - and she would have become forbidden to him forever on account of her committing adultery during the first period of marriage. The same applies to adultery committed during the period of her marriage to his brother, as is stated in the first chapter [Sotah 2a:3]: "And if her husband dies she performs ḥalitza and may not enter into levirate marriage"

Line 12

When Rabbi Meir said: Amen that I will not become defiled in the future, it did not - enter his mind that she would be evaluated [by the water] now on [events that might take place in] the future.
Will destabilize her - they will return to her throat, like a person who chokes on a liquid appears to gargle. It is the term [expressed in the verse] "they raise a cry of anguish" [Isaiah 15:5].

Line 13

Concerning a later marriage - according to Rabbi Meir who said that he may stipulate about the future, can he stipulate with her using "extension of an oath" that she will not defile herself, if he will divorce her and remarry her and defile herself?


Line 14

And afterward her husband took her back - the reason [he may not stipulate with her] is because she was defiled during the time she was divorced, which does not cause her to become forbidden to him. But he may indeed stipulate now [as to a case where] she was defiled after he took her back.


Line 15

The law of jealousy - one law for all jealousies -- that for all [incidents] he may act with her according to this law.

Line 16

Rabbi Yehuda says [the word] "this" - is a restrictor: this one, but not another one.
Ditch digger - to bring water into the fields and roads for the pilgrims.
With regard to two men - if her husband who made her drink dies, and she was married to another man, and he warned her and she secluded herself -- we accepted Neḥunya's testimony that the second [husband] makes her drink, because Rabbi Yehuda interprets "this" as a restrictor -- that she does not drink and repeat on account of the first husband warning her again; and he interprets "law of" as an amplifier -- that she drinks a second time on account of her second husband. And because Rabbi Yehuda says that she drinks again on account of the second husband, it implies that the first tanna would hold that even the first husband can make her drink twice. Thus we will ask "but according to the first tanna, isn't it written "this"? What does [the first tanna] consider that to exclude?

They issue halachic rulings from their mishnayot -- it says "they erode the world" with mistaken teaching, since they do not know the reasons of the mishna, which leads them to compare it to a thing to which it is not similar. And further, there are many mishnayot which are said like Ploni, and Ploni is an individual voice and the halacha is not established from such. And further, they do not know about the disagreements (machlokot) of the first/former tannaim, who the halacha is like -- and therefore they teach mistakenly.

Eshkolot- until their days there was never a dispute (machloket) among the sages of Israel. They all would say things [exactly] as they were given to Moses at Sinai and they were the first to dispute...this was the first dispute among Israel on the words of the Torah.

"The honor of the Torah ceased" - that he (Rabbi Akiva) would draw out meaning from every jot and tittle of every letter, and all the more so from superfluous words and letters, like "I derive it [from the fact that the verse could have stated:] “The daughter [of a priest,” but instead states:] “And the daughter [of a priest] (Leviticus 21:9)." (Sanhedrin 51b)

Line 16


"From the time when Rabban Gamliel the Elder died, the honor of the Torah ceased" - In Megillah 21a, it says that until he died, there was health in the world and people would only learn Torah standing. From the time that he died, weakness/illness descended on the world and they needed to learn Torah sitting.
