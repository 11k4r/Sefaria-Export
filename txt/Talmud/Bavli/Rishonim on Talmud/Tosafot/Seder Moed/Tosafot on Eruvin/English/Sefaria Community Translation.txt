Line 1

Or perhaps it is a case where there are enough [people] (this Tosafos is following a version of the text where the 2 alternative questions were said in the opposite order) -- since even if the Halakha is not like Rabbi Eliezer, [perhaps there is a permissible way that] he can go [back] in [when there are enough people to make a wall all the way back inside the Shabbos boundary -- thereby not requiring that the Halakha be like Rabbi Eliezer].   ...
And if you will say that the Rabbanim, [arguing on Rabbi Eliezer] who say that he cannot go back in, even if he is only 1 handbreadth outside the Shabbos boundary, [and] even though the 4 handbreadths of his personal boundary overlap inside his original Shabbos boundary, [that they would say] here too: even if a wall of people could extend [from where Rav Nechemiah is standing] to inside the boundary, he cannot return -- [we can resolve that difficulty] by saying that it is not similar [to the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbanim], because here, when the wall of people disperses, and he has already gone out of the 4 handbreadths the sages gave him [when he went outside the original Shabbos boundary] -- now it would be necessary to give him another 4 handbreadths boundary.  But since he is now back in his original Shabbos boundary, he is not given another 4 handbreadths, rather he returns to his original Shabbos boundary [of 2,000 handbreadths].  But in case where he does not lose his [new boundary of] 4 handbreadths by walking back in [to the original Shabbos boundary] -- he cannot return [to the original boundary].


Line 2

Because if he [Rav Nachman] was speaking of a case where there were not enough people, what question could you have? --  And even though Rabbi Meir invalidates an animal for [use] as a wall for the Sukkah [as the Gemara brings in the] upcoming [section], it was obvious to Rava that the Halakha follows Rabbi Yehuda's opinion [who permits using an animal] (and, a fortiori, Rabbi Yehuda permits using people as well).  
(Therefore Rava does not consider the possibility that Rav Chisda was asking about the Halakhic validity of using people to create an enclosure).  
But we cannot explain [the basis Rava's rationale] that, regarding [using] people [for a wall], even Rabbi Meir agrees that [the basis for prohibiting an animal is due to] its propensity to run away does not apply to people [when used as a wall].  Because [in the final analysis] this [reason of propensity to run away], was not Rabbi Meir's reason [for prohibiting an animal], as the Gemara concludes in the chapter "The One Who Sleeps" (Sukkah 23a).  
And [although] the Gemara investigates in the upcoming section by questioning whether we learned that Rabbi Meir explicitly prohibits using people and implements [to create a valid Sukkah wall], this [question is posed from the point of view] of the one [Amora] who explains in the Gemara Sukkah, that the reason for Rabbi Meir's prohibition is [solely due to the fact that] we are concerned that perhaps the animal will run away.
