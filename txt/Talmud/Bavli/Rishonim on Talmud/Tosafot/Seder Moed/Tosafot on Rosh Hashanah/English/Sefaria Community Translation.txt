Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

It was taught in a Mishna: They are four days in the year that serve as the new year. In every Mishnaic instance (when things are enumerated and then subsequently listed) it says "they are" (hen) as is found here as well as ( Shevuot 49a) "They are four types of guards" and (Chullin 17b) "They are three types of knicks"

Line 17

<b>Rava said, "That is to say one who blows for the music (<i>lashir</i>) has fulfilled [his obligation]":</b> As commandments do not require intent. In the chapter [entitled] Arvei Pesachim (Pesachim 114b), it is implied that it is [the basis of] an argument concerning, "[Vegetables] would be set before him; he dips the lettuce." As [a beraita] is taught in the Gemara, "If one ate [vegetables] of doubtfully tithed produce, he has fulfilled [his obligation]. If he ate them without the intent, he has fulfilled [his obligation]." But in a different baraita [there, it says], "It was taught (in a baraita) [that] Rabbi Yosei says, 'Although one has already dipped the lettuce, it is a commandment to bring before him  (matzah), lettuce and <i>charoset</i>.'" And there it infers that it is perforce not on account of a signal [for the children to ask], since it taught, "it is a commandment." Rather it is on account of commandments not requiring intent [and he did not have intent the first time]. But now that which Rava had to infer from here and did not bring the baraita from there that taught it explicitly is since I would have said that it is [only] with the vegetables [which are] rabbinic; but [with] Torah commandments, intent is required. And that which he asks from baraitot later and does not challenge from Rabbi Yose there is since he could have found to push it off [by saying,] "That it is a commandment on account of [it being] a signal."

Daf 28b



Line 1

<b>But here:</b> One who blows for the music (<i>lashir</i>) is merely acting unawares. And later in the last chapter (Rosh Hashanah 32b), we learn (in a mishnah), "One who [blows] acting unawares has not fulfilled [his obligation]."

Line 5



Line 6

<b>But [a case] where the hearer had intent, but the sounder did not have intent, how is that found?:</b> He could not find to say, such that the sounder did not have intent to have the listener fulfill [his obligation] - as [this baraita] implied to him the same as that which [the Gemara] inferred at the end of the discussion: [The sounder] sounds for himself, like [the hearer] hears for himself. Hence he does not require intention. 

Line 7

<b>Where he sounded bark-like blasts:</b> [Rashi] explained, it is because, "he did not blow like the measure of the blast that is explained in our mishnah (Rosh Hashanah 33b)." But that is difficult. As, if so, even if he had had intent, he also would not fulfill [his obligation]. So it appears to me,  he sounded bark-like blasts, since he did not intend to blow the measure of the blast, but he [nevertheless] blew the measure of the blast. And perhaps this is what [Rashi] means to say. Or also (another answer) is that it is similar to what [Rashi] explained later in the last chapter (Rosh Hashanah 33b) - he was acting unawares, as he [only] blasted the shofar, but it came out for him as a [proper] blow.
