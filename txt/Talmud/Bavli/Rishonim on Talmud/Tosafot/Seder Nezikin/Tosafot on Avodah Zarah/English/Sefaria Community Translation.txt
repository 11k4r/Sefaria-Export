Daf 10b



Line 1



Line 2

<b>He sent him coriander (<i>kusbarta</i>):</b> According to the explanation of Rashi, it is difficult. What arose in the mind of Rabbi at first to say that he should slaughter her? And it is also difficult that at the end, Rabbi reversed himself. Hence what appears [to be correct is] like Rabbenu Chananel and the Arukh - that he sent him <i>gargira</i>, meaning to say, "Gira committed adultery." [As] "the adulterer and the adulteress" (Leviticus 20:10) [is translated in] the Targum Yerushalmi [as] <i>giara vegiarta</i>. He sent him coriander (<i>kusbarta</i>) - "Cover (<i>kassa</i>) her disgrace and rebuke her in secret." But Antoninus did not understand what he sent to him and thought that he said, "Slaugther the daughter." So he sent him leeks (<i>karti</i>) - that is to say, "Are you giving me counsel that my offspring be cut off (<i>yikaret</i>)?" [So] He sent him, lettuce (<i>chasa</i>) - that is to say, "I only sent to you that you should have pity (<i>tachus</i>) on her," meaning, "I told you to cover [up for] her."   

Line 3



Line 4

<b>He would kill one at the entrance of the house of Rabbi:</b> And if you will say (ask): And is not the spilling of blood (murder) one of the seven [universal] commandments? And it is even forbidden to a Jew, for behold it was taught (below, Avodah Zarah 26a), "Idolaters and shepherds of small domesticated animals - we do not raise them [out of a pit], but we don't lower them [into it]." It can be said (answered) that he was afraid lest they would make the thing known to the ministers and they would cause him to be killed; and we say if someone comes to kill you, arise early to kill him. And it can also be said (answered) that he chose the heretics and the denouncers. For even though there are no [disqualifications on account of being from the] heretics among the [other] nations, concerning the acceptance of sacrifices from them; concerning lowering, there are - as it is challenged in the first chapter of Chullin (13b), "Now if one lowers a Jewish [heretic] into a pit, is it necessary [to say that one lowers a gentile one]?"

Line 5

<b>He said to him, "If so, tell that servant who is standing at the entrance, etc.":</b> Rabbi Elchanan explained that we do not teach [the version], "If so." As if he had said it, Rabbi Chanina should have understood that he was dead. As if he was [only] asleep, what power is there in awakening a person from his sleep? We say in a Midrash, "Milk renders impure, milk renders pure: When Rabbi was born, they decreed not to circumcise; but his father and his mother circumcised him. The Caesar sent and brought Rabbi and his mother before him. But his mother exchanged him with Antoninus and nursed him, until she brought him before Caesar. So he found him uncircumcised and dismissed them peacefully. Yet that leader said, 'I saw that they circumcised that one; but the Holy One, blessed be He, does miracles for them at every instant.' So they rescinded the decree." And we say similarly in the Yerushalmi that in the end, Antinonus studied Torah, converted and circumcised himself.

Line 1

Rashi's commentary: The rabbis decreed [that one must not eat "stewed" or cooked foodstuffs of a non-Jew] because of the concern lest they eat impure things. And more [than this concern] it seems that the reason [for this decree] is because of [the concern] of intermarriages [between Jews and non-Jews]. And thus [in] Chapter 5 of the Mishnah, the great Rabbi Abraham son of Rabbi David said certainly lashes [are given because] the sages forbade a non-Jew from cooking in his house [for a Jew], but if he [i.e. the non-Jew] cooks in the house of a Jew, there is no suspicion of either intermarriage or of eating impure things. But Rabbeinu Tam did not agree with him, that certainly when it comes to a non-Jew cooking, the sages did not divide the general principle [of forbidding food cooked by a non-Jew] between the domain of the Jew and the domain of the non-Jew, because there is always a suspicion lest one is not careful also in the home of the Jew in the same manner that one is careful in the home of the non-Jew
