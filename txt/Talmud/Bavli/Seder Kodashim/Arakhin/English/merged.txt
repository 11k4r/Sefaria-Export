Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

[Mishnah]  ALL [PERSONS] ARE FIT TO EVALUATE OR TO BE MADE THE SUBJECTS OF VALUATION, ARE FIT TO VOW [ANOTHER'S WORTH] OR HAVE THEIR WORTH VOWED: — PRIESTS, LEVITES AND [ORDINARY] ISRAELITES, WOMEN AND SLAVES. 
PERSONS OF UNKNOWN SEX AND HERMAPHRODITES ARE FIT TO VOW [ANOTHER'S WORTH], OR TO HAVE THEIR WORTH VOWED, AND ARE FIT TO EVALUATE, BUT THEY ARE NOT FIT TO BE MADE THE SUBJECTS OF VALUATION, FOR THE SUBJECT OF VALUATION MAY BE ONLY A PERSON DEFINITELY EITHER MALE OR FEMALE. 
A DEAF-MUTE, AN IMBECILE, OR A MINOR ARE FIT TO HAVE THEIR WORTH VOWED OR BE MADE THE SUBJECT OF VALUATION, BUT THEY ARE NOT FIT TO MAKE EITHER A VOW [OF ANOTHER'S WORTH] OR TO EVALUATE, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO MIND. 
[Gemarah]  What does ALL [PERSONS] ARE FIT TO EVALUATE mean to include? 
— It is meant to include one close to manhood who must be examined. 
What does [ALL7 ARE] FIT TO BE MADE THE SUBJECTS OF VALUATION mean to include? — 
It is meant to include a person disfigured, or one afflicted with boils. 
For one might have assumed that since Scripture says: 
A vow according to thy valuation, that only such persons as are fit to be made the subjects of a vow [as regards their worth], are fit to be made subjects of a valuation, and that persons who are unfit to be made subjects of a vow [as regards their worth], are also unfit to be made subjects of a valuation, hence Scripture informs us: of persons. i.e., 
no matter who they be. 
What does [ALL PERSONS] ARE FIT TO VOW mean to include? — 
[The phrase ALL] is needed only for [the clause] 
‘are fit to have their worth vowed’ 
— What is to be included [in the phrase ALL] ARE FIT TO HAVE THEIR WORTH VOWED? Is it to include persons of unknown sex or hermaphrodites — but they are expressly stated [in our Mishnah]! Again is it to include a deaf-mute, an imbecile and a minor — they too are expressly stated! And if it is to include a person below the age of one month — that too is expressly mentioned! And again if it is to include an idolater — he too is expressly mentioned! 
— In reality it is meant to include a person below the age of one month; and the Mishnah states it [by implication] and later on expressly mentions it. 
What does ‘All persons are obliged to lay on hands’ mean to include? 
— It is meant to include the heir, and this against the view of R. Judah. 
What does ‘All persons can effect a substitute’ mean to include? — 
That, too, means to include the heir, in contrast to the view of R. Judah. 
For it was taught: 
An heir must lay on hands, an heir can effect a substitute. 
R. Judah says: 
An heir does not lay on hands, and an heir cannot effect a substitute. 
What is the reason of R. Judah's view? 
— [Scripture says:] His offering,(Leviticus 1:3) i.e., but not his father's offering. 
And he infers the rule concerning the commencement of the dedication of the animal from the rule governing its end. 
Just as at the end of the dedication the heir does not lay on hands, thus also at the beginning he cannot effect a substitute. 
And the Rabbis? 
— [Scripture says redundantly:] And if he shall at all change — that included the heir.(Leviticus 27:10) 
And we infer the rule concerning the end of the dedication from the rule governing the commencement of the dedication. 
Just as at the beginning of the dedication the heir has power to effect a substitute, so at the end is he obliged to lay his hands on the animal's head. 
But what do the Rabbis do with 
‘his offering’? [They interpret:] 
‘his offering’, but not the offering of an idolater; ‘his offering’, but not the offering of his neighbour; ‘his offering. i.e., to include all who have a share in the ownership of a sacrifice in the duty to lay on hands. 
And R. Judah? — He does not hold that all who have a share in the ownership share the obligation of laying hands thereon; 
or, indeed, if he should hold so

Daf 10a











































Twelve days of the year the Chalil is played
Why are these [days] different [that the Chalil is played on them]?
Since on these [days] an individual completes the Hallel
As R' Yohanan says in the name of R' Simeon ben Yehotzadak
[On] eighteen days [of the year] and individual completes the Hallel
The eight days of the Chag [Sukkot], the eight days of Chanukah, and the first day of Pesach and the first day of Atzeret [Shavuot]
And in the diaspora, twenty- one days
The nine days of the Chag [Sukkot], the eight days of Chanukah, and the two [first] holy days of Pesach and the two holy days of Atzeret [Shavuot]
Why is the Chag [Sukkot] different, that we say [Hallel] on each day, and why on Pesach do we not say [Hallel]?

Daf 10b

All days
of the Chag [Sukkot] are separate in their sacrifices; [those] of Pesach are not separate in their sacrfices
Shabbat, which has unique sacrifices, [Hallel] should be said
It is not called a 'Moed'
Rosh Chodesh, which is called a 'Moed', it should be said
It is not sanctified with [a prohibition against] doing work, as it is written
"The song shall be for you as [on] the night of the sanctification of the holiday." That [day] which is sanctified as a holiday requires song; that [day] which is not sanctified as a holiday does not require song.
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Hakippurim, which are called 'Moed', and are sanctified with [a prohibtion against] doing work, [Hallel] should be said?
[It is not said] because of [the statement of] R' Abahu, as R' Abahu said, The ministering angels said before Hakadosh Baruch Hu,
Master of the World, why does [the nation of] Israel not sing before you on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Hakippurim?
He [G-d] replied to them,
Is it possible that the King sits on the Throne of Judgment, and the books of the live and the books of the dead are open before Him, and [the nation of] Israel sings before Me?
But [what about] Chanukah, that is not thus [called a Moed] and not thus [sanctified with a prohibition against doing work], and [yet, Hallel] is said?
Because of the miracle [of Chanukah]
Purim, [when] there is a miracle, it should be said?
R' Yitzchak said,
Because we do not sing on a miracle [that occurred] in the diaspora
R' Nachman bar Yitzchak asked:
But there is the exodus from Egypt, which [occurred] in the diaspora, and we say Hallel?
As it was recorded [according to the B'raisa]
Before [the nation of] Israel entered the Land [of Israel], all other lands were appropriate to sing. After they entered the Land [of Israel], other lands were not appropriate to sing.
R' Nachman said:
Its reading [of the Megillah] is its Hallel
Rava said:
Whereas there, [it fits with what is said] "Praise, servants of Hashem" - and not [ie, are no longer] servants of Pa'aroh; here, "Praise, servants of Hashem" - and not [ie, only those who are no longer] the servants of Achashveirosh
[However] we are still servants of Achashveirosh
According to R'Nachman, who said
'Its reading [of the Megillah] is its Hallel', isn't it recorded [in the B'raisa]
'After they entered the Land [of Israel], other lands were not appropriate to sing.'
Once they were exiled, [all other lands] were now appropriate as originally [before the nation of Israel entered the Land of Israel].

Reish Lakish quotes, 
"This is the ritual (lit. Torah) for a leper..."
this is in reference to the law (lit. Torah) for one who speaks Lashon Harah
And Reish Lakish asks, "Where do we learn this?"
"If the serpent bites before it is charmed, the charmer has no advantage."

Daf 17a

..



"This is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah" (Psalms 24:16). R. Yehudah HaNasi and the Rabbis disagreed on how to interpret this verse. One says:
'A generation parallels that of its leader.' And one says:
'A leader parallels that of his generation'
