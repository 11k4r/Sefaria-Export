Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

[Mishnah]  [IF] AN EGG IS LAID ON A FESTIVAL-DAY, BETH SHAMMAI SAY: 
IT MAY BE EATEN [ON THE SAME DAY], BUT BETH HILLEL MAINTAIN: 
IT MAY NOT BE EATEN [UNTIL THE DAY IS OVER]. 
BETH SHAMMAI SAY: 
[THE QUANTITY OF] LEAVEN IS OF THE SIZE OF AN OLIVE AND LEAVENED BREAD IS OF THE SIZE OF A DATE, BUT BETH HILLEL MAINTAIN: 
BOTH ARE OF THE SIZE OF AN OLIVE. 
HE WHO SLAUGHTERS GAME ON POULTRY ON A FESTIVAL-DAY, BETH SHAMMAI SAY: 
HE MAY DIG UP [EARTH] WITH A SHOVEL AND COVER [THE BLOOD], BUT BETH HILLEL MAINTAIN: 
ONE MAY NOT SLAUGHTER UNLESS HE HAS [LOOSE] EARTH PREPARED FROM THE DAY BEFORE [THE FESTIVAL]; 
BUT THEY AGREE THAT IF HE HAS [ALREADY] SLAUGHTERED, HE MAY DIG UP [EARTH] WITH A SHOVEL AND COVER [THE BLOOD], BECAUSE THE ASHES OF THE HEARTH ARE MUKAN [CONSIDERED AS HAVING BEEN PREPARED].
[Gemarah]  What are we discussing? 
If one should say about a hen kept for food, what is the reason of Beth Hillel, 
[seeing that] it is food which has been separated; 
and [if] about a hen kept for laying eggs, what is the reason of Beth Shammai, 
[seeing that] it is mukzeh? 
— But what objection is this? 
Perhaps Beth Shammai do not accept [the prohibition of] Mukzeh? 
(We are of the opinion that 
even he who permits mukzeh forbids nolad; what then is the reason of Beth Shammai?) 
— R. Nahman replied: 
In tale [we are debating] about a hen kept for laying eggs; but he who accepts [the prohibition of] mukzeh accepts [the prohibition of] nolad, and he who rejects [the prohibition of] mukzeh rejects [the prohibition of] nolad: Beth Shammai is [of the same opinion] as R. Simeon and Beth Hillel is [of the same opinion] as R. Judah. 
But did R. Nahman say thus? 
Surely we have learnt: 
Beth Shammai say: 
One may remove [on the Sabbath] from the table [with the hand] bones and nutshells; but Beth Hillel maintain: 
One lifts off the whole table-top and shakes it. 
And R. Nahman said: 
As for us, we only hold that Beth Shammai [follow the view] of R. Simeon! 
— R. Nahman can reply to you: 
With reference to the Sabbath where the Tanna teaches anonymously according to [the opinion of] R. Simeon as we have learnt: 
You may cut up gourds for cattle and a carcass for dogs Beth Hillel is made to represent the opinion of R. Simeon; 
but
