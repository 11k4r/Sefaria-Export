Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival</span> (<span class="it-text">Eduyyot</span> 4:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: It may be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> even on that day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not be eaten, </span>as the Gemara will explain at length. Apropos this exceptional case, in which Beit Shammai are lenient and Beit Hillel are strict, the mishna cites additional <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the Festivals in which this unusual phenomenon occurs (<span class="it-text">Yoma</span> 79b). <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: Leaven, </span>i.e., dough that has leavened to such an extent that it is no longer used as food but as a leavening agent for other dough, is prohibited on Passover in the measure <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">olive-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, the measure for edible <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread </span>is greater, that <span class="gemarra-regular">of a large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">date-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>For both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that, </span>the measure is that <span class="gemarra-regular">of an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">olive-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
Furthermore, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters an undomesticated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> animal or a bird on a Festival </span>(<span class="it-text">Eduyyot</span> 4:2), in which case there is a mitzva from the Torah to cover the blood after slaughtering (Leviticus 17:13), <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: He digs </span>earth <span class="gemarra-regular">with a shovel and covers </span>the blood with that earth <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He may not slaughter </span><span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he had earth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prepared </span>for that purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">concede that if one </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the animal or the bird, <span class="gemarra-regular">then he should dig with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a shovel and cover </span>the blood. Additionally, they agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that the ashes of a stove are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>for the use of covering blood, as will be explained by the Gemara.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing </span>in this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a chicken </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is designated for eating, </span>i.e., one planned to slaughter and eat a chicken that laid an egg, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason that Beit Hillel </span>prohibit eating the egg? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is food that has been separated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">de’ifrat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The entire chicken is considered food, as it is designated for eating, and this egg is simply a part that became detached. Just as one may partake of the chicken itself on a Festival, its egg should likewise be fit for consumption.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna must be referring to the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a chicken designated for laying eggs. </span>Since the owner of this chicken decided not to eat it on the Festival, it is classified as set-aside [<span class="it-text">muktze</span>], and <span class="it-text">muktze</span> items may not even be moved, let alone eaten. Since the chicken itself is <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, its egg is <span class="it-text">muktze</span> as well.
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason of Beit Shammai </span>for permitting one to eat the egg? After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the difficulty? Perhaps Beit Shammai do not hold </span>that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> There are different opinions with regard to the scope of the prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. It is possible that Beit Shammai, like other <span class="it-text">tanna</span><span class="it-text">’im</span>, maintain that there is no prohibition of this type of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. Perhaps this is the subject of their dispute with Beit Hillel. 
Before stating its proposed solutions for this difficulty, the Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enters our mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">even one who permits</span> moving an item that was <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span>by its owners on a Festival or Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span>the owners from doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>an object that <span class="gemarra-regular">came into being [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nolad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> on a Festival. One may not move an object that came into being on a Festival or Shabbat, since the owner never entertained the notion that he would be able to use it. This egg is certainly an object that came into being on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason of Beit Shammai?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Actually, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a chicken designated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for laying eggs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, our previous assumption was mistaken, as the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who holds </span>that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> in general also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that there is a prohibition of objects that <span class="gemarra-regular">came into being</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while one <span class="gemarra-regular">who does not hold </span>that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">does not hold </span>that there is a prohibition of objects that <span class="gemarra-regular">came into being </span>(<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 45b). Consequently, the dispute can be summed up as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span> hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who maintains that there is no prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel </span>hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda, </span>who rules that there is a prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>.
The Gemara is puzzled by this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did Rav Naḥman </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>Beit Hillel hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 143a) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">remove bone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and shell</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> left from the meal <span class="gemarra-regular">from the table, </span>despite the fact that they are inedible and are <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>It is prohibited to do so; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the entire board [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tavla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that is the table surface, which is a vessel that may be carried, <span class="gemarra-regular">and shake </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>all at once. By moving the table, which is not <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, one is able to shake off the bones and shells, but he may not move the items themselves. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman said:</span> That version of the mishna is not in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>; rather, the opinions should be reversed, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span> have <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing othe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> than the following version of this dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span>hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who maintains that the prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span> applies, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel </span>hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who maintains that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="it-text">muktze</span> does not apply. Why, then, does Rav Naḥman explain that the ruling of Beit Hillel in the case of the egg in the mishna is based on the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that there actually is a prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>?
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to Shabbat, </span>this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught us an unattributed </span>mishna, which is generally accepted as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 156b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">cut pumpkin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before an animal </span>to facilitate their consumption, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise one may cut up <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal carcas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before dogs, </span>even if the animal died on Shabbat, to enable them to consume it. Although that carcass is classified as <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, it may be moved on Shabbat. 
The Gemara concludes: That unattributed mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. For this reason, Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes </span>that the dispute between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai should be understood to mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that Beit Hillel</span> hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>whom the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> apparently follows, as there is a principle that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>

Daf 2b

<span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a Festival, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught us an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unattributed </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>(<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 156b), <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna in this tractate: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not chop woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">from beams </span>prepared for use in construction work, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>may one chop kindling wood <span class="gemarra-regular">from a beam that broke on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival. </span>As the beams were not prepared for this use when the Festival began, they are classified as <span class="it-text">muktze</span>; this demonstrates that an unattributed mishna prohibits <span class="it-text">muktze</span> on a Festival. Consequently, Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Beit Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who prohibits <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. He does so by asserting that the mishna is referring to the case of a chicken designated for laying eggs, which is <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. This concludes the Gemara’s explanation of Rav Naḥman’s rendering of the tannaitic dispute.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now since, </span>i.e., consider the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>wrote and edited the Mishna, and arranged <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unattributed </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mishnayot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. Since the same Sage formulated the statements in both tractates, the question arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the unattributed opinio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">for us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, and what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the unattributed opinion </span>and ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">for us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They </span>answer and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, which is stringen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> with regard to its punishments (see 35b), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore people <span class="gemarra-regular">will not come to treat it with contempt, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us the unattributed </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who rules leniently. </span>Conversely, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, which is lenient, </span>as certain labors may be performed on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore people <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>be more likely to <span class="gemarra-regular">come to treat it with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contempt, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">stated the unattributed opinion for us in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who rules stringently.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">did you </span>ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>the mishna? It was established as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a chicken designated for laying eggs, and </span>the prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. If so, rather than disputing with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to an egg </span>laid on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them dispute </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">chicken </span>itself. Instead of considering the secondary detail of an egg, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel could discuss whether or not the chicken itself may be slaughtered on a Festival. 
The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel also disagree with regard to the chicken, but the dispute was phrased in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">convey the far-reaching natur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai. </span>The formulation of the mishna emphasizes the extent of Beit Shammai’s lenient opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in the case</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>an egg, which is not a regular <span class="it-text">muktze</span> item but an item that <span class="gemarra-regular">came into being, </span>an especially stringent type of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, Beit Shammai nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">permit </span>it. By stating the dispute with regard to an egg, the mishna stresses Beit Shammai’s lenient opinion.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let them disagree with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to a chicken, </span>rather than an egg, <span class="gemarra-regular">to convey </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the far-reaching nature of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who prohibit </span>its use <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the more lenient case <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And if you say </span>it is better to present the dispute as in the mishna, so as to clarify the more lenient opinion, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the strength of leniency</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is preferable </span>(<span class="it-text">Berakhot</span> 60a), there is another option: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let them disagree with regard to both of </span>these cases.
The mishna could have said: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a chicken designated for laying eggs, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it and its eggs, Beit Shammai say: It may be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eaten, and Beit Hillel say: It may not be eaten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In this manner, the mishna could have referred to all aspects of the dispute, without the need for any lengthy addition. Consequently, Rav Naḥman’s explanation of the mishna is inadequate. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba said: Actually, </span>the above explanation should be rejected. <span class="gemarra-regular">We are dealing with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chicken designated for food and we are dealing with </span>an egg that was laid <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that occurs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">after Shabbat, </span>i.e., on a Sunday. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the relevant issue is not the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>; rather, one may not eat the egg <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation</span> from Shabbat to a Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any eg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laid now was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">fully develope</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yesterday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and merely emerged from the chicken today. Consequently, an egg laid on a Festival that occurred on a Sunday may not be eaten, as it was prepared on Shabbat, despite the fact that it was prepared naturally, by Heaven, rather than by man.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba, </span>who prohibits one to derive benefit even from something that was not prepared by man, conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his</span> standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning. As Rabba said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is writte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> with regard to the manna: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And it shall come to pass on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 16:5)? According to Rabba, it can be inferred from this verse that on an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">weekday,</span> “the sixth day,” <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>what is needed <span class="gemarra-regular">for Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>similarly, on an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">weekday one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>what is needed <span class="gemarra-regular">for a Festival. </span>However, on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not prepare for Shabbat, and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not prepare for a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to</span> Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>and the concern is only due to preparation, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>an egg laid on <span class="gemarra-regular">a regular Festival, </span>one that does not occur on a Sunday, <span class="gemarra-regular">be permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabba responded: That egg is not prohibited by Torah law, but by rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, due to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival </span>that occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">after Shabbat. </span>Abaye asked: On <span class="gemarra-regular">a regular Shabbat, </span>one that does not occur after a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">be permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to eat an egg that was laid on that day, provided that one does not cook it. Rabba similarly answered: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to a Shabbat </span>that occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">after a Festival. </span>
Abaye further asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> issue a decree </span>of this kind? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (see 6b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters a chicken </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> finds inside it fully developed eggs </span>with their shells, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted to eat them on the Festival. And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is so, </span>that that the aforementioned decree is in effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him issue a decree </span>and prohibit these eggs found inside the chicken, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to those that are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">laid on that day. </span>
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This is not difficult, as the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">fully developed egg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> found <span class="gemarra-regular">inside their mother is an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> uncommon matter, and </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncommon matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages did not issue a decree </span>as a preventive measure (<span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> 63b). The Sages issued their decrees only for usual situations, in which people might err, but they did not apply them to rare cases. This concludes the Gemara’s discussion of Rabba’s explanation.
The Gemara proceeds to explain other interpretations of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>An egg laid by a chicken designated for food is prohibited for a different reason: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree due to fruits that fal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> from a tree (<span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> 39b). Fruits that fall from a tree on Shabbat or a Festival may not be eaten, and the same applies to eggs that emerge from a chicken.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fruits that fall, what </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that the Sages prohibited them? 

Daf 3a

It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">climb </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and pic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> the fruit, as this would constitute the prohibited labor of harvesting. If so, the prohibition against eating fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">is itself </span>due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree. And will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we arise and issue a decree to </span>prevent violation of another <span class="gemarra-regular">decree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rav Yosef responded: That is not so; rather, when the Sages issued the initial decree, they enacted the prohibitions against both fruit that fall and a laid egg, as <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the prohibitions <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>components of <span class="gemarra-regular">one decree. </span>In other words, the similar cases of the fruit and the egg were both included in the original decree.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said </span>a different reason: An egg that was laid on a Festival is prohibited as <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree due to liquids that seepe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from the fruit (<span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> 39b), which is prohibited on that day. The legal status of an egg that was laid on a Festival is like that of liquids that seeped from a fruit on a Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">liquid that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seeped </span>from fruit, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that the Sages prohibited it? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest one </span>purposely <span class="gemarra-regular">squeeze </span>the fruit, and thereby perform the prohibited labor of threshing. However, the prohibition against consuming this juice <span class="gemarra-regular">is itself </span>a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree. And will we arise and issue a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decree to </span>prevent violation of another <span class="gemarra-regular">decree? </span>Rabbi Yitzḥak replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>the prohibitions <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>components of <span class="gemarra-regular">one decree. </span>When the Sages prohibited this juice, they banned the eating of an egg laid on a Festival for the same reason, as the actions are similar. 
As various explanations have been offered for this mishna, the Gemara seeks to clarify why each Sage was dissatisfied with the other explanations and suggested an alternative. The Gemara says: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>Rabba, Rav Yosef, and Rabbi Yitzḥak, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not state </span>their explanations <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">our </span>previously stated <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>to Rav Naḥman’s explanation. The other Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">also did not state </span>their explanations <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>as they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span>accept that there is a Torah prohibition of using items whose <span class="gemarra-regular">preparatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> was from Shabbat to a Festival or from a Festival to Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the following question arises: Since <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>provides an explanation that is similar to that of Rabbi Yitzḥak, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not state </span>his explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak? </span>The Gemara answers that Rav Yosef could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">An egg is food, and fruit is food, </span>i.e., an egg is comparable to fruits that fall. This observation would serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude juice, which is not food </span>but drink. Consequently, an egg is not comparable to juice and would not be included in the same decree.
The Gemara asks the reverse question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yitzḥak, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not state </span>his explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef? </span>The Gemara answers: He could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that the case of an egg is more similar to juices that seep from fruit. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">An egg is enclosed </span>inside a chicken before it is laid, and likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">juice is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enclosed </span>inside the fruit. This observation serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude fruits</span> that fall from a tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are standing exposed </span>on the tree. Therefore, the comparison between fruits that fall and an egg is weaker than the comparison between liquid that seeped from fruit and an egg. 
§ The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds </span>that the prohibition against eating an egg laid on a Festival is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to liquid that seeped </span>from fruit. What proof can be cited for this? It is proven <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan raised a contradiction </span>between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda </span>and a different statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda, and he resolved </span>the apparent contradiction in a manner that indicates his own opinion. 
The Gemara elaborates on the previous statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 143b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not squeeze fruit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to extract</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liquids from them </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>the liquids <span class="gemarra-regular">seeped</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out on their own, it is prohibited </span>to use them on Shabbat, lest he come to squeeze fruits intentionally. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: If </span>the fruit is designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for eating, </span>e.g., apples, the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that seeps from them is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>Since there is no concern that one might squeeze the fruit, there is no reason to prohibit its liquid. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the fruit was originally designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for liquids, </span>such as grapes for wine, there are grounds for concern that one might squeeze them, and therefore the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that seeps</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from them is prohibited.</span>
From the fact that Rabbi Yehuda said that liquid from fruit intended for eating is permitted, one can infer that, <span class="gemarra-regular">apparently, all food </span>that comes out of another food <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">food that was separated, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>Food that was separated is not considered a new food, but part of the food that previously existed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>against this from a different source: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda said further, </span>concerning untithed fruit, which may not be rendered fit to be eaten on a Festival by separating <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes from it (<span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> 39a): <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may stipulate a condition with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>untithed <span class="gemarra-regular">frui</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the first day </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a Festival, </span>and say: If today is the true Festival day, the second Festival day is actually a weekday. Therefore, this fruit is permitted, once I separate tithes from it, as on any other weekday. And vice versa: If today is, in fact, a weekday, and tomorrow is the Festival, I hereby separate its tithes today. 
Likewise, on the following day, he should again stipulate: If today is a weekday and yesterday was holy, I hereby separate tithes from the fruit now; if today is holy and yesterday was a weekday, separating the tithes yesterday was sufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span>may then <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>Festival day, as in either case no prohibition is involved. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, an eg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laid on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>Festival day may <span class="gemarra-regular">be eaten on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">secon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> day, regardless of which day is the actual Festival. 
Rabbi Yehuda’s statement indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> second </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>it is permitted to partake of the egg; but if the egg was laid <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first</span> day, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>one may not eat it. If so, Rabbi Yehuda apparently contradicts himself, as he said previously that liquid from food prepared for eating has the same status as the food itself, and that its emergence is considered to be nothing more than the separation of two foods from each other. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan resolves </span>the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span> attribution of the <span class="gemarra-regular">opinions </span>with regard to the second day of the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">is reversed </span>(<span class="it-text">Berakhot</span> 17b), so that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion corresponds with his ruling above.
The significance of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement for the issue at hand is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction between </span>the cases of an egg and liquid that oozed, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this that it is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> same reason </span>in both cases, i.e., an egg is prohibited on a Festival due to the rabbinic decree against liquid that oozed from fruit. 

Daf 3b

With regard to the contradiction presented by Rabbi Yoḥanan, which led him to suggest that the opinions should be reversed, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>that this is not the only possible resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, do not revers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the opinions. Rather, in the case of the two Festival days, one could claim that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda spoke to them in accordance with the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, </span>rather than presenting his own opinion. 
If so, Rabbi Yehuda’s statement should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In my </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">even on the first </span>Festival day, the egg is <span class="gemarra-regular">also permitted, as it is food that was separated. However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, according to your </span>opinion, which is that you prohibit liquid that comes from food, <span class="gemarra-regular">at least agree with me that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is permitted on the second </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two sanctities. </span>The first and second days of Rosh HaShana are not one unit, but two separate entities. Therefore, it is possible that the first day is sacred, while the second is a weekday. Consequently, an item prohibited on the first day might be permitted on the second. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis said to him: No, </span>the two days <span class="gemarra-regular">are one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctity, </span>i.e., they are viewed as a single continuous unit. The uncertainty applies equally to both of them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rav Ulla, said: </span>There is an alternative resolution to the contradiction raised by Rabbi Yoḥanan. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of the egg laid on a Festival, Rabbi Yehuda prohibited eating the egg since it is not from a chicken designated for food, whose legal status is that of food. Rather, the case refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to a chicken designated for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laying eggs, and Rabbi Yehuda </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he holds </span>that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the egg is produced by something <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, it is certainly <span class="it-text">muktze</span> itself, which means that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of food that was separated is inapplicable to this case.
§ The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which clarifies the issue differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both an egg that was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laid on Shabbat and an egg that was laid on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival </span>are considered to be <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, and therefore in both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not move </span>the egg, neither for the sake of food nor for any other purpose: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not to cover a vessel with it, nor to support </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the legs of a bed with it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if one wishes, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">cover </span>the egg <span class="gemarra-regular">with a vessel, </span>without handling the egg itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that it does not break </span>from being accidentally trodden upon. Although it is prohibited to move the egg itself, it is nevertheless permitted to move a vessel for its sake. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>with regard to whether this egg was laid on a Festival, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to move it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it became intermingled with a thousand </span>permitted eggs, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">all prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, who said </span>that an egg is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the lack of <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation, </span>this case involves <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is stringent. </span>Therefore, the egg is prohibited even if there is uncertainty whether it was laid on a Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to</span> the opinions of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yitzḥak, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that an egg is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a decree, </span>this case involves <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>with regard to the legal status of an item prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is lenient. </span>
The Gemara answers: In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived at </span>a different case. The case does not involve the prohibition of an egg laid on a Festival; the case involves an egg laid by a chicken with regard to which there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal with a condition that will cause it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>which is prohibited by Torah law. The uncertainty with regard to the legal status of the chicken is relevant to the egg. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this response: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the latter clause </span>of that same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If it <span class="gemarra-regular">became intermingled with a thousand </span>other eggs, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">all prohibited. Granted, if you say </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether the egg was laid on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether it was laid on <span class="gemarra-regular">a weekday, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is an object whose prohibition is temporary, </span>as the egg will be permitted on the following day, and the principle is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any object whose prohibition is temporary is not nullified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even by a thousand </span>permitted items. Since its prohibition will lapse on its own, there is no need to make use of the option of nullification.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say </span>that the egg referred to in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is an object whose prohibition is not temporary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as there is no way to permit the prohibition of <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it should </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">be nullified by </span>a simple <span class="gemarra-regular">majority.</span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg is significant and is not nullified, </span>as nullification applies only to items that have no intrinsic significance, while a significant object cannot be nullified, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned: Any </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">whose manner is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">to be counted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that is sometimes sold by unit, rather than by weight or volume, is considered significant. An egg falls into that category, as it is sometimes sold by unit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned: That </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">whose manner is </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be counted, </span>i.e., that is always sold by unit, is considered significant, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>Although eggs are often sold by unit, they are also often sold by weight or volume.
The Gemara cites the mishna where the dispute cited above appears. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>(<span class="it-text">Orla</span> 3:6–7): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who had bundles of clover, </span>a type of legume, that were <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>of food crops that grew <span class="gemarra-regular">in a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, those bundles <span class="gemarra-regular">must be burned. </span>If the bundles <span class="gemarra-regular">were intermingled with others, and </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">others </span>were intermingled <span class="gemarra-regular">with others, they must all be burned. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They may be nullified by one </span>part in <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> similar parts. When the prohibited portion is less than one-half of one percent of the permitted portion, the prohibition is nullified. 
The mishna continues: Rabbi Meir says that they must all be burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would say: That whose manner is </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be counted, </span>is considered significant and cannot be nullified. Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>the entire mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, </span>and it must be burned. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Only six items </span>are sufficiently significant to <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>the entire mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">seven. And they are: </span>High-quality <span class="gemarra-regular">nuts </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">Perekh, and pomegranates </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">Badan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sealed barrels </span>of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and branches of spinach</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cabbage stalks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Greek pumpkin. Rabbi Akiva adds: Even loaves of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> homeowner.</span>
Different prohibitions apply to these seven items. <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is fit </span>to be forbidden due <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> fruit that grows during the first three years after a tree is planted, is forbidden due to <span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. That which is fit </span>to be forbidden due <span class="gemarra-regular">to diverse kinds </span>of food crops that grew <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard </span>is forbidden due to <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard </span>(<span class="it-text">Avoda</span> <span class="it-text">Zara</span> 74a). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was stated about </span>the wording of this mishna that there is an amoraic dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned: </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">that whose manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">to be counted </span>is significant and cannot be nullified, and it is therefore prohibited by Rabbi Meir. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned: Any </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">whose manner is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">to be counted, </span>is significant and cannot be nullified.
Returning to the matter of the egg, the Gemara reprises its question: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, but according to Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan, what can be said? </span>Since an egg is not sold exclusively by unit, it is not significant. Therefore, the egg of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> should be nullified by a simple majority.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who said that an egg cannot be nullified, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litr</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dried figs, who, </span>based on his statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Any item </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is counted, even </span>if it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span><span class="gemarra-regular">law, cannot be nullified, and all the more so </span>items prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>e.g., the egg of a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learned </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">dried figs, </span>whose stems were removed, and were dried and pressed in different vessels and shaped into circles, the obligation to tithe fruits is by rabbinic law. If one forgot to tithe the figs, and later remembered that he placed the figs into a barrel, and during the process of producing a circle <span class="gemarra-regular">he pressed </span>the figs <span class="gemarra-regular">onto the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mouth </span>of one of the <span class="gemarra-regular">circular </span>vessels in which the circles are formed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not know into which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">circular </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">he pressed it; </span>or, if he recalls that he pressed it <span class="gemarra-regular">on the mouth of a barrel, but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not know in which barrel he pressed it, </span>or if he recalls that he pressed it <span class="gemarra-regular">on the mouth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span>straw <span class="gemarra-regular">receptacle, but does not know in which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">receptacle he pressed it, Rabbi Meir says </span>that in all these cases there is a dispute between the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the previous generation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>

Daf 4a

<span class="gemarra-regular">says: One considers the upper </span>circles of dried figs <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though they are separate </span>pieces, rather than one unit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the lower ones, </span>which were there beforehand and have certainly been tithed, <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify the upper ones, </span>as there are enough circles of figs in the entire barrel to nullify the upper <span class="it-text">litra</span>. 
In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua says: If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are one hundred mouths </span>of different barrels or circular vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the prohibited <span class="it-text">litra</span> of untithed figs on the mouth of one of the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">is nullified </span>by a ratio of one part of prohibited figs to one hundred parts of similar, permitted figs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if not, </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>circles of figs at the <span class="gemarra-regular">mouths </span>of the barrels or circular vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited, </span>as one of them clearly contains a prohibited <span class="it-text">litra</span> that has not been nullified. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span>figs on the <span class="gemarra-regular">insides </span>of the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted, </span>as the prohibited figs certainly did not reach there.This is Rabbi Meir’s version of the dispute.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>a different version of the dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: If there are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one hundred mouths </span>of vessels with permitted figs present <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in addition to the prohibited one, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is nullified </span>by the one hundred permitted mouths. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if not, the </span>figs at the <span class="gemarra-regular">mouths are prohibited and </span>those at <span class="gemarra-regular">the bottom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are permitted. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there are three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hundred mouths </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">there, they are not nullified, </span>as this <span class="it-text">litra</span> cannot be nullified in any manner. Rav Pappa was referring to this opinion when he said that there is a <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, meaning Rabbi Yehoshua in Rabbi Yehuda’s version, who maintains that even an item occasionally sold by unit, e.g., a circle of dried figs, can never be nullified. 
The same mishna further states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one pressed </span>the <span class="it-text">litra</span> of figs <span class="gemarra-regular">into a circular </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">but he does not know into which circular </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pressed it, everyone agrees </span>that the prohibited fig cakes <span class="gemarra-regular">are nullified. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agrees? This is </span>the very matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">their dispute, </span>whether or not the <span class="it-text">litra</span> is nullified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: This is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said, </span>i.e., he meant the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">One pressed it onto a circular </span>vessel but <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">know onto which place, </span>which side of the <span class="gemarra-regular">circular </span>vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">he pressed it, whether on its north or on its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> south </span>side. In this case, as the prohibited <span class="it-text">litra</span> is not located in a specific place and it cannot be distinguished from the others, it certainly cannot be considered an object of significance, and <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nullified. </span>
The Gemara explained why the egg mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, an egg laid by a chicken that is a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>, cannot be nullified even if it is mingled with a thousand permitted eggs. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Actually</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be explained as referring to a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival or a weekday. </span>While it is true that according to most opinions this is a rabbinic prohibition, and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is generally lenient with regard to uncertainties involving rabbinic law, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an object </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose prohibition is temporary. And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any object</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose prohibition is temporary, even </span>if it involves a <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic</span> prohibition, it <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be nullified.</span>
§ It <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say in the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg </span>laid on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">it and its mother may be eaten. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing? If we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a chicken designated for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obviou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it and its mother are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted. Rather, </span>say that this is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a chicken</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designated for laying eggs, </span>but in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">it and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its mother are </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. Rabbi Zeira said </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be understood as follows: The egg may <span class="gemarra-regular">be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eaten on account of its mother; </span>if it is permitted to eat the chicken, the egg may also be eaten. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span>In which case is it necessary to apply this ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">bought </span>this chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">specifying </span>whether he intended to eat it or use it for its eggs. In that case, if the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">it has been </span>retroactively <span class="gemarra-regular">clarified that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">intended for food, </span>and the eggs it lays are, therefore, permitted. If it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not slaughtered, it has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">been </span>retroactively <span class="gemarra-regular">clarified that it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">intended for laying eggs, </span>and the eggs it lays are prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari said </span>that the phrase: It and its mother may be eaten, should not be taken literally. Rather, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teachin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an exaggeration [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">guzma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for extra emphasis, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-italic">A</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: An egg</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">be eaten, it and its mother, and a chick</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and its shell. </span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of this addition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Its shell? If we say </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> actual shell, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a shell edible? Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be referring to the consumption of <span class="gemarra-regular">a chick </span>that is still <span class="gemarra-regular">in its shell. </span>This explanation is problematic, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov only </span>in permitting the eating of a chick immediately after it hatches, <span class="gemarra-regular">when it has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">entered the world. However, when it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">entered the world, </span>i.e., if the chick is still in its shell, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Even the Rabbis accept that this chick has the status of a creeping animal and may not be eaten. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>evidently the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">A chick and its shell, </span>should not be understood literally, as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an exaggeration</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here, too, </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">It and its mother may be eaten, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exaggeration. </span>It does not mean literally that the chick and its mother may be eaten, but is merely a statement of emphasis that the egg is undoubtedly permitted.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disputed the following issue (<span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> 38b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat and a Festival</span> occur on consecutive days, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>An egg <span class="gemarra-regular">laid on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this one is prohibited on that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: </span>An egg <span class="gemarra-regular">laid on this one is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on that one. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav holds </span>that when Shabbat and a Festival occur on consecutive days, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a single, indivisible day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav say: The</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">four elders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who said: </span>When a Shabbat and a Festival occur consecutively, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are two sanctities </span>rather than one long day; therefore, a joining of Shabbat boundaries need not be placed on a weekday, but may be placed on the first of the holy days to allow going beyond the Shabbat boundary on the second. Evidently, this issue cannot be the basis of their dispute. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree with regard to Rabba’s preparation, </span>i.e., an item that was prepared on its own from one day to the other, whose use Rabba prohibits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav holds</span> that items prepared by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba’s preparation </span>are prohibited, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold </span>that items prepared by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba’s preparation </span>are prohibited.
The Gemara comments: This dispute is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>An egg <span class="gemarra-regular">laid on Shabbat may be eaten on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival; </span>if it was laid <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may be eaten on Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name of Rabbi Eliezer: </span>This opinion is not unanimous; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is still a </span>matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute, as Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say it may be eaten, and Beit Hillel say it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not be eaten, </span>just as they disagreed about whether an egg is permitted on the day on which it was laid.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ahava’s host [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ushpizikhnei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had these eggs </span>that were laid on a Festival that occurred on a Friday, and the host was unsure whether eggs laid on the Festival were permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival for </span>use on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He came before </span>his guest, Rav Adda, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to roasting </span>these eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">now, </span>on the Festival, although eating them today is prohibited due to <span class="it-text">nolad</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and let us eat them tomorrow, </span>as they will be no longer be prohibited due to <span class="it-text">nolad</span>?
Rav Adda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your opinio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that led you to pose this question? You evidently assume that in the dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>and therefore an egg laid on one day will be permitted on the following day. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">even Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan permitted </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">to swallow it only </span>raw, <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the next day, </span>when it is no longer prohibited; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the same day </span>that it was laid, he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit one even to move it, and certainly not to roast it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>likewise in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both an egg </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that was laid on Shabbat and an egg that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">laid on a Festival, one may not move it, neither </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to cover a vessel with it nor to support the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">legs of a bed with it.</span>
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa’s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">host, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who came before Rav Pappa, had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these eggs </span>that were laid on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Shabbat that </span>occurred before <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival. He came before him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat </span>these eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow, </span>on the Festival? Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go </span>away from me <span class="gemarra-regular">now, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and come </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow. </span>He said this because <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not place a disseminato</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before him </span>to explain his lectures, <span class="gemarra-regular">from one Festival </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the end of the <span class="gemarra-regular">other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the second Festival day, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to drunkenness. </span>Since it was customary in those times to drink a great deal of wine during Festival meals, Rav was concerned that his mind would not be sufficiently clear to issue a public ruling. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>that man <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the following day, </span>Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 4b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>I issued a ruling for you <span class="gemarra-regular">then</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I would have forgotten </span>the correct response, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would have said to you, </span>based on the accepted principle that in the case of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>that the eggs are permitted. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav with regard to these three </span>issues, in connection to the sanctity of Festivals and Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>his ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient, or whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent. </span>This is one of those three cases in which the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">branches that fell from a palm tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to kindle them on a Festival </span>that occurs the next day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And do not reply to me </span>by asking why I permit <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg </span>to be eaten on the following day. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the distinction between the two cases? In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">egg, because on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">itself it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also fit to be swallowed </span>raw <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">only the following day, one knows </span>that an egg <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited on the day </span>it was laid. In contrast, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">branches, which are not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>for kindling <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>of Shabbat, as kindling a fire is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you permit them </span>to kindle the wood on the Festival that occurs on <span class="gemarra-regular">the following day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they will </span>mistakenly <span class="gemarra-regular">come to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">day</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>fell off the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">they are also permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>as for the reason the branches were not kindled <span class="gemarra-regular">yesterday </span>when they fell from the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was due</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat, as they were not fit for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kindling </span>then.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">branches that fell from a palm tree </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">into an oven on a Festival, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">add to </span>those branches <span class="gemarra-regular">wood prepare</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from the previous day, which may be used for kindling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and kindle them </span>all together. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t he turn over </span>and move <span class="gemarra-regular">the prohibited </span>wood in the course of the cooking process? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since most </span>of the wood <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, when he turns </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">over, he turns over permitted </span>wood, as the prohibited part is nullified by the majority. 
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t he </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a prohibited</span> item <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>by adding permitted wood to the pieces of wood that fell into the oven, which are prohibited? <span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>in a mishna (see <span class="it-text">Terumot</span> 4:9): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not nullify a prohibited </span>item <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only to </span>items prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law; however with regard to </span>items prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rabbinic law, </span>as in this case involving the prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the prohibition <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said: Any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">object whose prohibition is temporary, even </span>if the prohibition applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be nullified, what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there to say? </span>Doesn’t Rav Ashi agree that it is permitted to kindle the wood after the Festival? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only where the prohibited </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">remains intact; here, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">the prohibited </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">is burned, </span>as the wood is turned over when it has already become charcoal. Therefore, one does not perform any action with prohibited items. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that there is a dispute between <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for the <span class="gemarra-regular">two Festival days </span>observed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Diaspora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>An egg that <span class="gemarra-regular">was laid on this </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted on that </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Asi said: </span>An egg that <span class="gemarra-regular">was laid on this </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that Rav Asi holds </span>that the two days <span class="gemarra-regular">are one sanctity. But didn’t Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Asi </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">recite </span><span class="gemarra-italic">havdala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the prayer of distinction at the end of a holy day, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>day of the Diaspora <span class="gemarra-regular">to the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> This shows that, in his opinion, the first day is the true Festival, while the second day is considered a weekday. In earlier generations, they observed the second day of the Diaspora because they were unaware when the court sanctified the New Moon to mark the beginning of the month. Today, that determination is accomplished by means of calculations known to all, and the second day is observed as the custom of our fathers, not due to any uncertainty.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi was uncertain</span> whether the Sages’ ordinance that the second day is to be observed as a Festival was a fixed ordinance that applies even when the calculations determining the New Moon are known to all; or whether the ordinance was based strictly on the uncertainty stemming from their lack of awareness. Today, when everyone is aware of the beginning of the month, the second day is a weekday. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he acted stringently</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>and prohibited eating an egg on the second day that had been laid on the first day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he also acted <span class="gemarra-regular">stringently here, </span>and recited <span class="it-text">havdala</span> between the two days.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi </span>that the Sages considered the two days as one and it is not a practice instituted due to uncertainty, <span class="gemarra-regular">as today we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">know the determination of the </span>first day of the new <span class="gemarra-regular">mont</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> based on a fixed calendar and the precise dates of the Festivals are known by all, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> observe </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>of the Diaspora. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>On the contrary, It is <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>that the second day is observed as a Festival due to uncertainty, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Rosh</span> <span class="it-text">HaShana</span> 22b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, </span>after the court sanctified the new month, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would light torches </span>on the mountain tops, from one peak to another, to signal that the New Moon had been sanctified. <span class="gemarra-regular">After the Samaritans </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">Kutim</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">disrupted </span>this method by lighting torches at the wrong times, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that messengers should depart </span>to inform the people of the start of the month. Since the messengers could not reach all Diaspora communities before the beginning of the Festival, the Sages instituted that an additional Festival day should be observed there, due to the resultant uncertainty with regard to which day was the actual Festival day. 
Abaye continues his argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Samaritans had desiste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from their interference, the Sages would have restored the earlier custom and <span class="gemarra-regular">we would observe </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one day. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>similarly, in a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">messengers arrived </span>from Jerusalem on time, <span class="gemarra-regular">we observe </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">day.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now that we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know the determination of the </span>first day of the new <span class="gemarra-regular">month, what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we observe two </span>Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>in the Diaspora? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because they sent </span>a warning <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>from Eretz Yisrael: Although now there is a fixed calendar and there is no uncertainty, <span class="gemarra-regular">be careful to</span> observe <span class="gemarra-regular">the custom of your fathers </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you received, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">at times the monarchy </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">issue decrees </span>of persecution restricting Torah study and the fixed calendar may be forgotten. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the people will <span class="gemarra-regular">come to </span>have their proper observance of the Festivals <span class="gemarra-regular">be disrupted </span>again. However, the fundamental <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the observance of two Festival days is based on uncertainty.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> discussed a similar problem, with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">two Festival days of Rosh HaShana. Rav and Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">both said: </span>An egg <span class="gemarra-regular">laid on this </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on that one, </span>as the two days of Rosh HaShana have a special status. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Rosh</span> <span class="it-text">HaShana</span> 30b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">would accept testimony</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>witnesses who saw the new moon to establish the first day of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">month. </span>This system would also be used for the first of Tishrei, which is Rosh HaShana, and the court would accept this testimony on <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>thirtieth <span class="gemarra-regular">da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of the month of Elul. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the witnesses tarried </span>and managed <span class="gemarra-regular">to arrive </span>only when the hour was late, 

Daf 5a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and the Levites </span><span class="gemarra-regular">erred in the song</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They were unsure whether to sing the weekday song or that of Rosh HaShana during the sacrifice of the afternoon daily offering, as it was unclear whether or not witnesses would arrive that day. From that point on, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted that they would accept </span><span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>who came to testify that that day was Rosh HaShana <span class="gemarra-regular">only up to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">minḥa</span> time, i.e., when the daily afternoon offering was sacrificed. If witnesses had not arrived by then, they would declare Elul a thirty-day month and calculate the dates of the Festivals accordingly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if witnesses came from </span><span class="gemarra-italic">minḥa</span> time <span class="gemarra-regular">onward, </span>although the calculations for the dates of the Festivals began only from the following day, the people would nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">observe </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that day </span>on which the witnesses arrived as <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred, and </span>they would also observe <span class="gemarra-regular">the following day </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred. </span>On the second day, they observed Rosh HaShana in full, both by sacrificing its offerings as well as calculating the upcoming Festivals from that date. It is evident that the observance of two days of Rosh HaShana did not stem from uncertainty in the Diaspora as to when the Festival began. Rather, the Sages instituted that the two days of Rosh HaShana are one unit due to the inherent difficulty in determining the date of a Festival that is celebrated on the first of the month.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: From </span>the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> onward, an egg</span> laid on one day of Rosh HaShana <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>on the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Rosh</span> <span class="it-text">HaShana</span> 30b): <span class="gemarra-regular">After the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> instituted that </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">accept testimony </span>to determine the start of <span class="gemarra-regular">the month all day. </span>Since the concern about errors was no longer relevant, they reverted to the original custom. As the court was aware of the exact date based on the testimony of the witnesses, those in proximity to the court kept only one day of Rosh HaShana. Those who lived far from the court observed two days merely due to uncertainty, and as one of those days was certainly a weekday, an egg laid on the first day was permitted on the second.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: But didn’t Rav and Shmuel both say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg is prohibited? </span>Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Your question is out of place; <span class="gemarra-regular">I say to you </span>a statement in the name of the distinguished <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Yoḥanan ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zakkai, and you say to me </span>a ruling of the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel? </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel, </span>isn’t it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is difficult, </span>as it indicates that the special status of Rosh HaShana has been revoked? The Gemara answers that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is for us, </span>those who live outside of Eretz Yisrael, who have kept the ancient custom of observing two Festival days, and therefore Rosh HaShana is still considered one long day and constitute a single sanctity. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ruling of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is for them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael. Since Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai instituted that the court should once again accept testimony all day concerning the new moon, then even if circumstances dictate that Rosh HaShana would be observed for two days, each day is considered an independent sanctity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even from the </span>time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Zakkai onward, an egg </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion of Rav Yosef? It is that the decree prohibiting an egg laid on the first day of Rosh HaShana on the second day of Rosh HaShana <span class="gemarra-regular">is a matter that </span>was established <span class="gemarra-regular">by a vot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the Sanhedrin, after that occasion on which the witnesses failed to arrive on time, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">any matter that </span>was established <span class="gemarra-regular">by a vote requires another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vote to permit it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A new vote must be taken to render the prohibited item permitted, as the prohibition does not lapse even if the reason for the decree no longer applies. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: From where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do I say </span>my opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written, </span>after the Jews received the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go, say to them: Return</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to your tents</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Deuteronomy 5:26), where “your tents” is referring to your wives. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says, </span>before the revelation at Sinai: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">When the ram’s horn sounds long, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may come up to the mount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 19:13). And it is stated: “Be ready for the third day, do not come near a woman” (Exodus 19:15). In other words, although the original prohibition served a particular purpose, in this case the giving of the Torah, it was nevertheless necessary to explicitly render the prohibition permitted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this idea <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The fruit of a <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth-year grapevine</span> have the status of second-tithe fruits, and therefore their owner <span class="gemarra-regular">would ascend to Jerusalem </span>and eat them there. If he was unable to do so, due to the distance involved or the weight of the load, he could redeem the fruits with money where he was, and later redeem that money for other fruits in Jerusalem. However, the Sages decreed that fruit from the environs of Jerusalem should not be redeemed, but that the owners should bring the fruit itself to Jerusalem. The environs of Jerusalem for this purpose were defined as <span class="gemarra-regular">a day’s walk in each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">direction. And this is its boundary: Eilat to the north; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akrabat to the south; Lod to the west; and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jordan to the east</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla said, and some say Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar bar Ḥana </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>did the Sages institute this ordinance, that someone who lived near Jerusalem must bring his fruit there? <span class="gemarra-regular">In order </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to adorn the markets of Jerusale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with fruit, </span>as this decree ensured that there was always an abundance of fruit in Jerusalem for people to eat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was</span> further <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>ben Hyrcanus, a student of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, <span class="gemarra-regular">had a fourth-year</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grapevine </span>located between Lod and Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Lod alongside the village of Tavi. </span>The grapevine was within the environs of Jerusalem for the purpose of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. Rabbi Eliezer could not bring the fruit to the Temple, as it had been destroyed, 

Daf 5b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he sought to render </span>the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless </span>in favor <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the poor, </span>for whom it would be worth the effort to bring the fruit to Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">His students said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Rabbi, </span>there is no need to do so, as <span class="gemarra-regular">your colleagues have already voted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">you and permitted it.</span> The members of the Sanhedrin have already taken a vote and permitted the redemption of the fruit of a fourth-year grapevine even near Jerusalem. The reason is that after the destruction of the Temple there is no need to adorn the markets of Jerusalem. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who are</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Your colleagues? </span>This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara infers from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason is that they </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">voted </span>to annul the decree, which indicates that if <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had not voted, </span>the ordinance would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have lapsed on its own, despite the fact that its justification was no longer applicable. Similarly, the prohibition of a laid egg is not nullified, as it was never explicitly permitted.
The Gemara to seeks to clarify why Rav Yosef cited two verses as proof. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the reason for: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why does Rav Yosef find it necessary to quote a second verse? The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what he <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying. Now since it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Be ready for the third day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not come near a woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 19:15), <span class="gemarra-regular">why do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>need the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go, say to them: Return to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your tents</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Deuteronomy 5:26)? After three days the prohibition would lapse in any case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>established by <span class="gemarra-regular">a vote requires another vote to permit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>an alternative explanation, that the instruction to “return to your tents” was not given to permit the men to return home to their wives, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">it came </span>as a special command <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva of conjugal rights, </span>i.e., the obligation of a man to engage in periodic marital relations with his wife, then it was to refute this possibility that Rav Yosef continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a different proof from another verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">When the ram’s horn sounds long, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they may come up to the mount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 19:13).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Now since it is written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neither shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the flock</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor the herds feed before that mount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 34:3), this indicates that the prohibition applies only when the Divine Presence is revealed on the mountain, and it is permitted immediately afterward. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">When the ram’s horn sounds long”? </span>Why is a special signal required? <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any matter </span>established by <span class="gemarra-regular">a vote requires another vote to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permit it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: That </span>statement, that a specific vote is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> matters prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, but </span>in the case of a matter prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, no, </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> does not apply, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fourth-year grapevine. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the fruit of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fourth-year grapevine </span>must be brought to Jerusalem and may not be redeemed is <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, and they </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to Rabbi Eliezer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your colleagues have already voted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">you and permitted it. </span>This indicates that without a vote, the prohibition would not be abrogated.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you say: </span>In the case of the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg also, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai took a vote</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on it and permitted it; </span>the Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> took a vote, </span>it was with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to testimony </span>to determine the start of the month; <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not take</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a vote to </span>annul the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg was </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by a vote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Did the court take a special vote to render prohibited an egg laid on Rosh HaShana? Isn’t the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">egg dependent on </span>the matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony? </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony </span>in the late afternoon <span class="gemarra-regular">was prohibited, </span>the eating of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg </span>laid on Rosh HaShana <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>as well, and when this <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony was permitted, </span>the eating of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was </span>automatically <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>Rav Yosef’s observation is therefore incorrect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda and Rav Shalman, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>came <span class="gemarra-regular">from Bei Keloḥit, said: Even from the </span>time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">onward, an egg </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. What is the reason? May</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Temple speedily be built, </span>and the ordinance that testimony is accepted only until <span class="it-text">minḥa</span> time will be restored, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> people <span class="gemarra-regular">will say: Last year, didn’t we eat an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> egg </span>laid on the first day of Rosh HaShana <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> the following day, <span class="gemarra-regular">the second Festival </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>Rosh HaShana? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, too, we will eat </span>it, like last year. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they will not know </span>the significant difference in <span class="it-text">halakha</span> between the two cases, as <span class="gemarra-regular">last year </span>the two days of Rosh HaShana were <span class="gemarra-regular">two sanctities, and now they are one</span> long <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity.</span>
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that this is the concern, <span class="gemarra-regular">we also should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not accept testimony </span>nowadays. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? May the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Temple speedily be built, and </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">will say: Last</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year, didn’t we accept testimony </span>to determine the start of <span class="gemarra-regular">the month all day? Now, too, we will accept</span> the testimony of witnesses even after <span class="it-text">minḥa</span> time.
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> compared? There, </span>with regard to witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">testimony is entrusted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the court, </span>and the court is capable of distinguishing between the reasons for decrees. <span class="gemarra-regular">An egg, </span>however, is <span class="gemarra-regular">entrusted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to all, </span>and as not all people will consult a Sage about the status of their eggs, there is a legitimate concern about error. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Even from the </span>time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and onward, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an egg </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>Rava explained his reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai conced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that if witnesses came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span><span class="gemarra-italic">minḥa</span> time <span class="gemarra-regular">and onward, </span>even after the destruction of the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">then one observes that day </span>as a <span class="gemarra-regular">holy </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">the following day </span>as a <span class="gemarra-regular">holy</span> day? The only difference is that during the time of the Temple any testimony delivered on the first day was not taken into account at all, which meant the second day was considered the first of the new year, whereas during the time of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai the new year was counted from the first day. 
As far as the sanctity of the Festival is concerned, however, the second day was also treated as sacred, which proves that when two days were observed in Eretz Yisrael, they were considered a single sanctity rather than two. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said </span>in summary: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav in these three </span>cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or whether </span>the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent. </span>

Daf 6a

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">died on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first day of a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentiles should attend to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>burial. If he <span class="gemarra-regular">died on the second day of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jews should attend to his </span>burial. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the legal status of the two days is like that of the two days of the Festivals; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not so with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an egg </span>that was laid on the first day of Rosh HaShana, as it remains prohibited on the second day.
The Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even with regard to an egg, </span>Rosh HaShana is no different from other Festivals, as an egg laid on the first day is permitted on the second. <span class="gemarra-regular">As what do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you think</span> i.e., what is your concern; <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>witnesses will fail to arrive, and the court <span class="gemarra-regular">will proclaim </span>the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Elul full, </span>i.e., thirty days long, and begin counting the year only from the following day? In that case, both days are kept as sacred <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t Rav Ḥinnana bar Kahana say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> in this regard: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the days of Ezra and onward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we have not found </span>that the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Elul </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">full</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the Sages employed various methods to ensure that there would be no need to add a thirtieth day. Consequently, Rosh HaShana would always occur on the thirtieth day after the beginning of Elul.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: We said </span>that Jews should attend to the dead on the second day of Rosh HaShana <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>the burial of the corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been delaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and for some reason the burial was not on the day that he died. In that case, the body might begin to decay, and the dignity of the dead is at stake. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if the burial <span class="gemarra-regular">has not been delayed, </span>and there is no concern for the dignity of the corpse, its burial may not be attended to on the Festival; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">we delay it </span>until the Festival has ended. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">though </span>the burial <span class="gemarra-regular">was not delayed, </span>but it is the day that he died, <span class="gemarra-regular">we still do not delay </span>the burial. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the dead, the Sages equated </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second Festival day with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a weekday. </span>This is true to such an extent that on a Festival it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">even to cut </span>material to fashion <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cloak for </span>the deceased. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to cut myrtles for </span>the deceased, to be placed on the bier in their honor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: And nowadays, when there are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥabarei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this practice must be adjusted. The <span class="it-text">ḥabarei</span> were Persian priests who made false accusations against Jews in Babylonia. They cited the fact that Jews were burying their dead on the second Festival day as proof that the day was not holy, and they forced them to work on that day. Since <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned </span>about this possibility, we do not bury the dead on the second day.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sat before Rav Ashi on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two Festival days of Rosh HaShana, </span>which occurred that year on Thursday and Friday. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">observed that </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">was sad. He said to him: Why is the Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sad? He said to him: </span>Because <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not prepare </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a joining of cooked foods, </span>and therefore I cannot prepare food or light a candle on Rosh HaShana for the upcoming Shabbat. When a Festival immediately precedes Shabbat, a joining of cooked foods is prepared before the Festival with ready-to-eat food. It is kept until Shabbat, symbolically indicating that any food prepared on the Festival for Shabbat is merely a continuation of that initial preparation.
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And let the Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prepare a joining of cooked foods now, </span>on the first day of Rosh HaShana, a Thursday. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rava say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A person may prepare a joining of cooked foods from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival day </span>of the Diaspora <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, by stipulatin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the following condition: If today is a weekday and tomorrow is holy, this shall be my joining of cooked foods, by means of which I may prepare food tomorrow for Shabbat; if today is holy and tomorrow a weekday, it is permitted to prepare food tomorrow as it is on any regular weekday, and a joining of cooked foods in not needed. 
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: </span>You can <span class="gemarra-regular">say that Rava stated </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the regular <span class="gemarra-regular">two Festival days of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Diaspora; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">did he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say so with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana? </span>The two days of Rosh HaShana are considered one long day, and they are both equally holy.
Ravina replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t </span>the Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even an egg </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>on the two days of Rosh HaShana, which are treated exactly the same as other Festival days in the Diaspora? The same ruling should apply to a joining of cooked foods. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mordekhai said to </span>Ravina: This does not resolve Rav Ashi’s difficulty, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master, </span>Rav Ashi, <span class="gemarra-regular">explicitly said to me that he does not hold </span>in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with this </span>opinion of the Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rather, he maintains that Rosh HaShana differs from other Festivals, and in this case there is no way to make up for failure to prepare a joining of cooked foods.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disputed the following case: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a chick that hatched on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, Rav said: It is prohibited. And Shmuel, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some say Rabbi Yoḥanan, said: It is permitted. </span>The Gemara explains the reasoning for their respective opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Shmuel, and some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is permitted, since it itself </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is rendered permitted through slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The slaughter of the chicken, which renders it fit to be eaten, is made possible by its hatching. Consequently, hatching likewise removes the prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kahana and Rav As</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Rav: And what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the difference between this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a calf</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> born on a Festival, </span>since you agree that a calf may be slaughtered on that day? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>There is a difference. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>a calf inside its mother is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared on account of its mother, by slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: If a cow is slaughtered, the calf inside its womb is also permitted. Therefore, that calf never had the status of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, whereas the chick was considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> before it hatched.
Rav Kahana and Rav Ashi further challenged Rav: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difference between this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>If the mother has a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months, neither it nor the calf inside it may be eaten. Nevertheless, after it is born the calf may be slaughtered on a Festival and it is permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">silent </span>and did not offer an answer, as though he did not know how to respond to the question.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef: What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav was silent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Let him say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them: </span>Even a calf born to a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> mother is not considered fully <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is prepared on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> account of its mother </span>to be fed <span class="gemarra-regular">to dogs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> On a Festival, it is permitted to slaughter a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> and give it to dogs as food, and therefore the calf is not fully <span class="it-text">muktze</span> even before it is born. By contrast, a chick in its shell is not intended as food for dogs, and therefore a chick that hatched on a Festival was unfit for use when the Festival began. Consequently, it was considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> and it is now <span class="it-text">nolad</span>, an object that came into being on Shabbat or a Festival, and it is therefore prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>

Daf 6b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>we know that food <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared, </span>i.e., fit, <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> human </span>consumption that became spoiled <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>automatically considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for dogs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as we learned </span>in a mishna (see 2a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One may cut pumpkins before an animal </span>to facilitate their consumption, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise one may cut up an <span class="gemarra-regular">animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carcass, </span>even of an animal that died on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dogs. Rabbi Yehuda says: If </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was not </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">a carcass, </span>i.e., it was not dead and fit for dogs, <span class="gemarra-regular">prior to Shabbat, it is prohibited, because it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in the </span>category of items considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>for use on Shabbat. This shows that although this animal was fit for human consumption while alive, it does not automatically become prepared for dogs once it dies. If so, can food <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared for dogs </span>be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared for humans?</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Yes. </span>It is not surprising that something <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>and fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for humans is not </span>considered fit and <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared for dogs, as that which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit for a person, one does not throw it to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dogs, </span>and he has therefore removed that animal from his mind. However, something <span class="gemarra-regular">that is prepared for dogs </span>is also considered fit and <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared for humans, as a person’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind is on anything fit to </span>be eaten by <span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>One does not completely remove from his mind even food meant for dogs, if it is kosher and edible. Consequently, one has in mind the possibility that he might eat the calf of a cow that is a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> once it is born, since at that point it will be kosher and edible.
With regard to the dispute itself, the Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav; and it is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, and some say </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan. </span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A calf born on a Festival is permitted; a chick</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> born on a Festival is prohibited. And what is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difference between this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one? This one, </span>the calf, <span class="gemarra-regular">is prepared on account of its mother by slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and that one, </span>the chick, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not prepared on account</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of its mother. </span>
The Gemara further explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and some say </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: A calf born on a Festiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a chick born on a Festival is </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason? This one, </span>the calf, <span class="gemarra-regular">is prepared on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">account of its mother; and that one, </span>the chick, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">itself rendered permitted through slaughter. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A chick born on a Festiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Even on a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> weekday, </span>the chick <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>on the day it hatched <span class="gemarra-regular">because its eyes have not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">opened</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A small chick of this kind is not yet considered a bird fit for consumption; rather, it is similar to a creeping animal.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose</span> opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is that which is taught: </span>The verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even all creeping animals that creep upon the earth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>you shall not eat them, for they are a detestable thing” (Leviticus 11:42) comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>in the list of prohibited creeping animals even <span class="gemarra-regular">chicks that have not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">opened</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their eyes. In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Ya’akov.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: An egg is fully </span>formed <span class="gemarra-regular">upon its emergence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> i.e., it is not considered an egg until it is laid. The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the statement: An egg <span class="gemarra-regular">is fully formed upon its emergence? </span>To which issue is Rava referring? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>he meant an egg <span class="gemarra-regular">is fully formed </span>and called an egg only <span class="gemarra-regular">upon its emergence, and </span>at this stage <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted to eat it with milk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this indicates that while an egg is still <span class="gemarra-regular">inside its mother, </span>even if it is fully formed, it is considered meat and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to eat it with milk. But isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughters a chicken and finds fully </span>formed <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs inside it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is permitted to eat them with milk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav’s statement should be explained as follows: An egg <span class="gemarra-regular">is fully formed upon its emergence </span>in that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to eat it on a Festival </span>only if the entire egg emerged on a weekday. The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: This indicates that if an egg is found <span class="gemarra-regular">inside its mother, it is prohibited to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat it on a Festival. But isn’t it taught:</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters a chicken and finds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fully </span>formed <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs inside it, it is permitted to eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them on a Festival?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that which the mishna did not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us, </span>and Rav stated the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> accordingly; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the mishna here, as it says in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg laid on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, Beit Shammai say it may be eaten, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel say it may not be eaten. And Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree only with regard to </span>an egg that was already <span class="gemarra-regular">laid, but </span>concerning eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">inside their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mothers, all agree </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that the mishna should be explained in the opposite manner, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel also prohibit </span>eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">inside their mothers, and </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: Laid, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to convey the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">far-reaching nature of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they permit even </span>an egg that <span class="gemarra-regular">was laid. However, </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters a chicken and finds inside it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fully formed eggs, it is permitted to eat them on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival. </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? It is the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai nor </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav certainly did not prohibit an egg that has not yet been laid. Instead, his statement should be explained as follows: An egg <span class="gemarra-regular">is fully formed upon its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> emergence, and it produces chicks, </span>i.e., an egg laid in the regular manner can be incubated and a chick will hatch from it. By contrast, an egg that remained <span class="gemarra-regular">inside its mother cannot produce chicks. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the practical </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>of this observation? The Gemara answers: It is relevant <span class="gemarra-regular">for buying and selling. </span>In other words, the difference between the types of eggs has ramifications for terms of commerce. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that incident involving <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the general public: <span class="gemarra-regular">Eggs </span>

Daf 7a

<span class="gemarra-regular">of a live </span>chicken, <span class="gemarra-regular">who has? </span>He sought to purchase eggs of this kind. <span class="gemarra-regular">They gave him eggs of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a slaughtered </span>chicken. <span class="gemarra-regular">He came before Rabbi Ami, </span>claiming he had been cheated. Rabbi Ami <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the sellers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is a mistaken transaction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it is rescinded; </span>the sale is void. 
The Gemara asks: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obviou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that the transaction is void, as he specified exactly what he wanted. The Gemara answers: The ruling is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">wants them for food </span>rather than for chicks, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that which he said, </span>that he is looking for eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">of a live </span>chicken, he said only <span class="gemarra-regular">because they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are hard-shelled, </span>mature eggs. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the practical </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difference, </span>i.e., what is this man claiming from the seller according to this rejected interpretation? He is merely demanding <span class="gemarra-regular">to refund him the difference </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> types of eggs. Rabbi Ami therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the sale involved a fundamental error, as the eggs of a slaughtered chicken are unfit for incubation. The transaction is therefore void. 
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person said to </span>vendors: Does <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs of </span>a chicken that has had relations with <span class="gemarra-regular">a rooster? </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone</span> have <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs of a rooster? They gave him eggs </span>that a hen had <span class="gemarra-regular">absorbed from the ground, </span>i.e., which had not been fertilized by a rooster. <span class="gemarra-regular">He came </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Ami </span>claiming that he had been cheated. Rabbi Ami <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">is a mistaken transaction, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is rescinded.</span>
The Gemara again asks: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the case. The Gemara explains: The ruling is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">wants </span>the eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">for food, and that which he said, </span>that he wants eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">of a rooster, </span>he said only <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are fatter. What is the practical difference; </span>i.e., what is this man claiming from the seller according to this rejected interpretation? He is merely demanding <span class="gemarra-regular">that they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should refund him the difference </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">between the two</span> types. Rav Ami therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not the case; rather, the sale is void.
The Gemara suggests another explanation of Rav’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the meaning of the claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">An egg is fully </span><span class="gemarra-regular">formed upon its emergence? </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fully </span><span class="gemarra-regular">formed with the emergence of most of it, in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan. As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>It is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg, most of which emerged </span>from the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival eve, and </span>the egg <span class="gemarra-regular">returne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> inside the mother and was finally laid on the Festival itself, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to eat </span>this egg <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival. </span>Since most of the egg had emerged before the Festival began, it is considered to have been laid the day before.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>the following explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the meaning of the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fully formed upon its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> emergence? </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fully formed upon the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> emergence of all of it. </span>The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the emergence of all of it, yes, </span>it is fully formed at this stage; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>if only <span class="gemarra-regular">most of it</span> came out the day before, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>it is not considered fully formed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this reading serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan. </span>In any case, Rav’s statement can correspond to this statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
§ Apropos the halakhic status of eggs found inside a slaughtered chicken, the Gemara discusses <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who slaughters a chicken and finds inside it fully formed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eggs, it is permitted to eat </span>these eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">with milk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Ya’akov says: If </span>the eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">attached</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by sinews, it is prohibited </span>to eat them with milk, as they are considered meat.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who eats</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">from a cluster of eggs </span>that are still attached to it by sinews, or <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">bones, or from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sinews, or from meat that has been detached from a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> live </span>animal, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure </span>because none of these are considered part of the meat of the bird, and therefore they do not impart the ritual impurity of an animal carcass. 
However, if one ate <span class="gemarra-regular">from the ovary of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which contains very small eggs that do not possess any of the regular characteristics of eggs, or if he took a piece <span class="gemarra-regular">of the craw or the intestines</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or if he melted the fat </span>of a dead bird <span class="gemarra-regular">and swallowed it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>from the impurity imparted by the unslaughtered carcass of a bird.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that if one ate <span class="gemarra-regular">from a cluster</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of eggs he is pure, </span>which indicates that eggs still attached by sinews to the chicken are not considered part of the meat of the bird? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>This ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov. For if </span>you say it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov, didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he say: If </span>the eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">were attached by sinews </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to eat them with milk, indicating that he considers these eggs meat of the chicken. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you draw this conclusion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Rabbi Ya’akov stated </span>that these eggs are part of the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>against eating the eggs with milk; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to ritual impurity </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say that these eggs are considered part of the chicken. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity let us also issue a decree</span> and be stringent in a case of uncertainty and therefore rule that these attached eggs should be considered part of the chicken, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>would serve to <span class="gemarra-regular">proliferate impurity, and we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not proliferate impurity </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One does not declare an item ritually impure by rabbinic law merely because uncertainty has arisen with regard to its status. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>a different version of this discussion, according to which the question is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that if one eats <span class="gemarra-regular">from the ovary of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs he is ritually impure?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Ya’akov, who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If </span>the eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">were attached by sinews, they are prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Abaye said to him: From where </span>do you know <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> the term <span class="gemarra-regular">ovary </span>means: <span class="gemarra-regular">From these </span>eggs <span class="gemarra-regular">that are hanging</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the ovary; perhaps </span>it is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">ovary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself, </span>the part of the flesh of the bird where the eggs develop?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you say: </span>If it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the ovary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">itself, what </span>is the purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">of stating </span>this? It is obvious that the ovary itself is meat. One can answer as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as it is in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the craw and the intestines, that even though they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meat </span>according to all opinions, <span class="gemarra-regular">since there are people who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not eat </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary to teach us </span>that they have the status of meat; <span class="gemarra-regular">here, too, </span>with regard to an ovary, <span class="gemarra-regular">since there are people who do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not eat </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary to teach us </span>that it may not be eaten with milk. Therefore, this argument does not prove that this version of the discussion is incorrect.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>species <span class="gemarra-regular">whose intercourse </span>occurs only <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>hours of the <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">born </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">by day; any </span>species <span class="gemarra-regular">whose intercourse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">occurs </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at night is born </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">by night; any </span>species <span class="gemarra-regular">whose intercourse occurs either by day or by night </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is born either by day or by night. </span>The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>species <span class="gemarra-regular">whose intercourse occurs by day is born </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by day, this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a chicken</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Any </span>species <span class="gemarra-regular">whose intercourse occurs by night is born by night, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this is a bat. Any </span>species <span class="gemarra-regular">whose intercourse occurs either </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by day or by night, </span>this means <span class="gemarra-regular">a human </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">and all that are similar to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: Any </span>species <span class="gemarra-regular">whose intercourse occurs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by day is born by day, this is a chicken. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">practical </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>of this statement? The Gemara answers: The halakhic difference is with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to that which Rav Mari</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kahana </span>said, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">examined a chicken’s nest on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eve and did not find an egg in it, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the following day, </span>on the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">he rose early </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and found an egg in it, </span>the egg is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as it can be assumed it was not laid that night.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t he examine </span>the nest before the Festival and fail to find an egg there? If so, the egg must have been laid on the Festival. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">examine very carefully. And even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did examine carefully, </span>you can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">most of </span>the egg <span class="gemarra-regular">emerge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on the eve of the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">and returned </span>inside its mother, and this ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> shows that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> does not take into account the possibility that a chicken could lay an egg at night.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Shaul say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one examined a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chicken’s nest on a Festival eve and did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> find an egg in it, and the following day he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rose early and found an egg in it, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited? </span>This indicates that a chicken might indeed lay an egg at night. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an egg <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">absorbed from the earth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., one that was not formed by male fertilization. An egg that is not produced by intercourse can be laid at night as well.
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari’s</span> case <span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>you can <span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">absorbed from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the earth </span>and laid the egg during the night of the Festival. How, then, could Rav Mari permit the egg? The Gemara answers: There it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a male with it. </span>The Gemara asks: Even <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a male with it, </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">also say that it absorbed from the earth </span>rather than from the male. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>as a tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">male is present, </span>a chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">does not absorb from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">earth.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until where </span>exactly is it considered to have a male with it; How near must a rooster be for this principle to come into effect? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Gamda said in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of Rav: </span>The male must be <span class="gemarra-regular">any place </span>

Daf 7b

<span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the hen can <span class="gemarra-regular">hear its voice by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>when sounds cannot be heard as easily as at night. If the chicken is close enough to hear the rooster’s call by day, the rooster is considered close enough to the chicken that the latter will produce eggs only through fertilization by the male. 
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mari took action </span>in accordance with this opinion, when he found an egg on a Festival morning after he had looked in the nest the day before and failed to find an egg there. He examined <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty houses </span>from the chicken, and although he did not find a rooster within this area, he assumed there was one further away and permitted the egg.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a river </span>between the rooster and the chicken, the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cross </span>the river; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if there is a bridge, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">crosses </span>the river. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a rope</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bridge </span>suspended across the river, the chicken will <span class="gemarra-regular">not cross</span> on the rope. The Gemara comments: Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>occurred in which a chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">crossed over on a rope bridge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>However, one may not rely on this possibility.
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">did you establish </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul, who prohibits eating an egg discovered in a nest on a Festival morning after the previous day’s examination revealed nothing? You said that it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>which the chicken <span class="gemarra-regular">absorbed from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> earth. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>a situation in which <span class="gemarra-regular">one examined </span>the nest the evening before? The same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should apply <span class="gemarra-regular">even when one did not examine </span>the nest beforehand. 
The Gemara answers: In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not examine </span>the nest, one could <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the egg <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>laid <span class="gemarra-regular">yesterday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and there is no reason to prohibit its use. Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul therefore specified that he checked the day before and is certain that the egg was not laid prior to the Festival. The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, when he examined </span>the nest <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, say: </span>Perhaps this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">most of </span>the egg <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged and returned, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan? </span>The Gemara answers: The case discussed <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>where most of the egg emerged from the chicken and returned, <span class="gemarra-regular">is uncommon, </span>and therefore it is assumed not to have occurred. 
Apropos one statement of Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul in the name of Rav, the Gemara cites another ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This crushed garlic </span>poses the <span class="gemarra-regular">danger of exposure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If mashed garlic is not properly covered, there is concern that a snake might have tasted from it and thereby injected its venom into the food. This garlic is consequently prohibited as a health risk.
§ The mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>The measure that determines liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, the measure for leavened bread is greater, a large date-bulk. According to Beit Hillel, the measure in both cases is an olive-bulk.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Beit Shammai? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that the measures are equal, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> write </span>only the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread, and it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would not be necessary </span>to write <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven, and I would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the measure that determines liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread, whose leavening is not </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">extensive, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven, whose leavening is extensive, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all the more s</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> should the measure that determines liability be an olive-bulk. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the explicit reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven that the Merciful One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>in the verse: “Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19)? It must be <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the measure of this, </span>leavened bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not equal to the measure of that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> leaven. Rather, the measure that determines liability for leaven is smaller. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel </span>maintain that both the mention of both leaven and leavened bread <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary. As if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Merciful One had written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven, I would have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>its measure that determines liability is an olive-bulk <span class="gemarra-regular">because its leavening is extensive. However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread, </span>whose <span class="gemarra-regular">leavening is not extensive, say no, </span>that is not the measure. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to mention leavened bread as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One had written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread, </span>I would have said that the measure that determines liability for leavened bread is an olive-bulk, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is fit for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consumption </span>on its own; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, leaven, which is not fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for consumption </span>on its own but only when used as a leavening agent for dough, <span class="gemarra-regular">say no, </span>its measure is not like that of leavened bread. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to mention both cases.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, don’t they hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zeira’s </span>opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Zeira said, </span>the verse states: “Seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel” (Exodus 12:19). <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse begins with leaven and ends with leavened </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bread to say to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven is equivalent to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread. </span>How, then, can Beit Shammai maintain that the two are prohibited by different measures?
The Gemara answers: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the measure that determines liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">eating, everyone agrees </span>that the same measure applies to leavened bread and leaven. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>of leavened bread from one’s house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">removal from </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">eating. </span>Rather, with regard to the obligation of removal, different measures apply to leavened bread and leaven. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">removal from </span>the measure that determines liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">eating.</span>
The Gemara comments: This idea <span class="gemarra-regular">was also stated </span>explicitly by <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>of leavened bread; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the measure that determines liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">eating, everyone agrees </span>that the measure for both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And no leavened bread shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be seen with you, and no leaven shall be found </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in all your borders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 13:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>obligation to remove leavened bread <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>subject to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute between Beit Shammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Beit Hillel, as Beit Shammai say: </span>The measure that determines liability for removal of <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the measure for leavened bread is <span class="gemarra-regular">a large date</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-bulk, and Beit Hillel say: </span>The measure for <span class="gemarra-regular">both this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel is with regard to the obligation to remove leavened bread, not liability for eating it.
§ The mishna states that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel also dispute whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bird on a Festival, </span>without having prepared earth the day before with which to cover the blood after the slaughter, may dig out earth on the Festival itself to cover the blood. 
The Gemara analyzes the wording of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who slaughters </span>an animal; this indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the fact</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yes, </span>one may dig out dirt, but <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, no, </span>even Beit Shammai agree that one may not slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird if there is no prepared dirt. Otherwise, the mishna would have said: One may slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not slaughter </span>it. This proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Beit Shammai, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may slaughter </span>it even <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>and meant the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughter </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and cover </span>the blood. They are emphasizing that one may not cover the blood even if he slaughtered an animal, whereas Beit Shammai maintain that if one slaughtered he may cover the blood <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">concede</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that if he </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered, then he may dig with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a shove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cover </span>the blood, which indicates that Beit Hillel were not emphasizing the covering of the blood. This proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>referring to one’s action <span class="gemarra-regular">after the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fact</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying. </span>The phrase: One who slaughters an animal, is not a broad directive on how to act, but rather it means: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">comes to consult </span>a Sage on how to proceed, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>should the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him? Beit Shammai say </span>that the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: Slaughter </span>it <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">dig, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and cover </span>the blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: He may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughter </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">only if he had earth </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared while it was still day. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>provided a slightly different explanation of the mishna and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughters animals who comes to consult, what does </span>the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him? Beit Shammai say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: Go dig, slaughter </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and cover </span>the blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: He may slaughter </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">only if he had earth </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared while</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was still day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Let us say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master, </span>i.e., Rav Yosef, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>the following statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Zeira </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said, as Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters </span>an undomesticated animal or bird is obligated to perform the mitzva of covering the blood, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he must </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place earth beneath </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">and earth above </span>it,<span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall pour out its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood and cover it in earth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 17:13). It <span class="gemarra-regular">is not stated: </span>Cover it with <span class="gemarra-regular">earth, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">in earth,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>indicating that the blood must be concealed inside the earth. The verse thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that one who slaughters </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">must</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place earth beneath and earth above </span>the blood.
Abaye is suggesting <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Master is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Zeira, </span>and therefore he requires one to dig first and only afterward slaughter the animal and have the blood flow onto that earth and then cover it with additional earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Zeira.</span>
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: This is not so; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to me and </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabba we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>of the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Zeira, and here we disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>prepared <span class="gemarra-regular">earth beneath, yes, </span>in that case one may slaughter an animal, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is no </span>earth prepared beneath, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he may not slaughter it at all. Why not? Rabba says: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are concerned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps one will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reconsider and not slaughter </span>it at all, and he will have dug a hole on a Festival unnecessarily. <span class="gemarra-regular">And according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to my </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the contrary: This </span>situation, in which he is permitted to dig first, <span class="gemarra-regular">is preferable, since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you do not permit him </span>to dig in all cases for the purpose of slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will </span>be unable to eat meat and will <span class="gemarra-regular">refrain from rejoicing on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival. </span>
§ That mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">concede that if one </span>transgressed and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered an </span>animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">then he digs with a shove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and covers </span>the blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zerika said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: And that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">when one has a shovel </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">embedde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>before the onset of the Festival. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what purpose does an embedded shovel serve; <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t he </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>the act of <span class="gemarra-regular">crushing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as one must crush the lumps of earth to make the soil fit for covering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>

Daf 8a

Here it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> loose earth </span>that does not require further crushing. 
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even in the case of loose earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">one makes a hol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> by the very act of removing the earth or the shovel from that place. The Gemara answers: This ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba, as Rabbi Abba said: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who digs a hole on Shabbat, </span>but he <span class="gemarra-regular">needs only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its eart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> and has no interest in forming a pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt for </span>that act. Since he has no interest in the hole, he is considered to have performed a destructive act, and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that one who commits a destructive act is not liable for the performance of prohibited labor on Shabbat and Festivals. 
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">That the ashes of a stove are prepared. </span>The Gemara express puzzlement at this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">The ashes of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a stove, who mentioned anything about it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why does the mishna suddenly speak about the ashes of a stove when it had not previously discussed or even mentioned them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: This is what </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said: And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ashe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a stove are prepared</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, everyone agrees that in addition to prepared earth, the ashes of a stove are also considered prepared, and one may cover the blood with them. It is not necessary to prepare these ashes especially for this purpose the day before. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: They only taught </span>that the ashes of a stove are considered prepared if the stove <span class="gemarra-regular">was ignited on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival eve, </span>so that the ashes had already formed at the start of the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ignited on the Festival </span>itself, the ashes are <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the ashes are still hot and <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roast an egg in them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> they are not considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, and therefore it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to use them for covering as well. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When they said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the ashes of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stove are prepared, they said </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">only when it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ignited on the Festival eve; however, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it was ignited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the Festival, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. And if </span>the ashes are still hot and <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to roast an egg in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>
The Gemara further states: If before the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">one brought earth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into his garde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or his ruin </span>to use for various needs, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to cover </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">said: A person may bring in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a basketfu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of eart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> the day before the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">and use </span>both the basket and the earth it contains <span class="gemarra-regular">for all his needs </span>on the Festival.
With regard to this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zutra </span>added and <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in public <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra the Great </span>that the application of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is limited: <span class="gemarra-regular">And that is </span>the case only <span class="gemarra-regular">if one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designated a corner for this </span>earth, thereby demonstrating that he intends to use it for all his requirements, rather than merely bringing earth in to scatter over the floor of the house. In that case, the dirt is nullified. It is considered part of the floor, which means that it is once again classified as <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against this from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bikkurim</span> 4:9): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a kosher animal with characteristics of both domesticated and non-domesticated animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not slaughter it on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival, </span>as it is uncertain whether or not its blood requires covering. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if one did slaughter it, he may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not cover its blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so,</span> that one may use his basket of earth as he wishes, as claimed by Rav Yehuda, even if a <span class="it-text">koy</span> is definitely a domesticated animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him cover it, in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara expresses surprise at this objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to your reasoning, </span>one could equally suggest: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cover </span>the blood of the <span class="it-text">koy</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with ashes of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stove or with </span>earth dug up with <span class="gemarra-regular">an embedded shovel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>this mishna must be referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where one does not have </span>prepared earth to use for covering the blood; <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>one can say <span class="gemarra-regular">that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have </span>a basket of earth ready for all his needs.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if the mishna is referring to a situation where one does not have prepared earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>the case of a <span class="it-text">koy</span>, where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty</span> whether there is a mitzva to cover its blood? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even</span> in the case of an undomesticated animal, whose blood must <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly </span>be covered, slaughter should <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>be permitted, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel that one may not slaughter if he does not have prepared earth.
The Gemara explains that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking</span> utilizing the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary </span>to state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">definite </span>undomesticated animals and birds, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to slaughter </span>them; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Due to the joy of the Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let one slaughter </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and not cover </span>its blood, as there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether there is a mitzva to cover its blood, and therefore it is overridden by the mitzva to rejoice on a Festival. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span> that one should not slaughter it <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span> if he does not have something prepared with which to cover the blood. 

Daf 8b

The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause teaches: And if he slaughtered it one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not cover its blood, it may be inferred that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the first clause we are dealing with </span>a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does have </span>something with which to cover the blood. If he does not have anything he can use, why is it necessary to state that one may not cover it? And consequently, if he does in fact have material with which to cover the blood, why may he not do so, either with his basket of earth, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, or with the ashes of a stove? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the ashes of a stove, </span>which the mishna stated are prepared, are <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>covering the blood in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a definite </span>obligation, but they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared for </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although his intention was to use these ashes to cover the blood of any animal he slaughters, whether in a definite or an uncertain case, they are nevertheless not considered prepared for an uncertain case.
The Gemara inquires: In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of uncertainty, what is the reason </span>that the ashes are not considered prepared? If the reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that one makes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a hole </span>in the mound of ashes when he removes part of it for covering, in <span class="gemarra-regular">a definite </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also makes a hole. </span>If it is prohibited to make a hole, that prohibition applies in all cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must say, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abba, </span>that the making of this hole is not considered prohibited labor, as he is merely performing a destructive act. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>in a case of uncertainty, there should be no cause for concern, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara retracts from the previous suggestion and offers an alternative: With regard to a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, what is the reason</span> that it is prohibited? The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps one</span> will forget and <span class="gemarra-regular">perform crushing </span>with this earth, to ready it for covering. However, the same problem arises as before: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we should also decree </span>against covering the blood in <span class="gemarra-regular">a definite </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he might <span class="gemarra-regular">crush </span>the earth. The Gemara answers: This presents no difficulty, as when one fulfills the mitzva of covering the blood in <span class="gemarra-regular">a definite</span> case, even <span class="gemarra-regular">if he performs crushing, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">positive </span>mitzva of covering the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and overrides </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>concerning the desecration of a Festival.
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that we said </span>the following principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">A positive </span>mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">comes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and overrides a prohibition </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">such as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision of </span>a child who has <span class="gemarra-regular">leprosy. </span>Cutting off a leprous blemish is a violation of a prohibition. However, if a baby’s foreskin is leprous, it is permitted to cut it off by circumcision. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the principle applies to a case of a linen <span class="gemarra-regular">cloak on </span>which woolen <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fringes </span>are placed, despite the prohibition against wearing diverse kinds, i.e., a mixture of wool and linen. 
The Gemara explains the difference between those <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> and the issue at hand. In those cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one uproots </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfills </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">positive </span>mitzva with the same act. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of covering blood, two separate actions are involved, as <span class="gemarra-regular">at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time that one uproots </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition, </span>when he crushes the earth, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not fulfill </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">positive </span>mitzva of covering the blood. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as it is possible to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that when one crushes </span>the earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">he covers </span>the blood with it; he fulfills the positive mitzva by means of the same action through which he uproots the prohibition.
The Gemara challenges this explanation from a different perspective: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, a Festival is </span>a mitzva that includes both the <span class="gemarra-regular">positive </span>mitzva of rest <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> against performing prohibited labor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">a positive </span>mitzva by itself <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not override a prohibition and a positive </span>mitzva together. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects the previous explanation, in favor of the following. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> One’s initial <span class="gemarra-regular">intention </span>is to use <span class="gemarra-regular">the ashes of a stove</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>a mitzva that is <span class="gemarra-regular">definite, and he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">intention for </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty. </span>One may not use an article on a Festival for a purpose which he did not have in mind beforehand. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava follows his </span>regular line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>in this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in earth </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to cover </span>a baby’s <span class="gemarra-regular">excrement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with it </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cover with it the blood of </span>a slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">bird. </span>Since he prepared this earth for a case of uncertainty, as it is possible that the baby will not soil the house, he certainly intended to use it for covering the blood of a bird prepared before the Festival for slaughter. If, however, one prepared the earth at the outset to cover <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of a bird</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to cover excrement with it, </span>as he did not know in advance that he would require the earth for this purpose. He had only definite uses in mind, not possible ones such as covering excrement.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharbel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Even</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">one brought in earth to cover the blood of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bird with it, it is permitted to cover excrement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with it, </span>as it cannot be said that he did not intend this usage. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They say in the West</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Eretz Yisrael, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥama and Rabbi Zeira disagree with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some say </span>it was disputed by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, son of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama, </span>commonly mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud as Rava, without the patronymic, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira. </span>The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is similar to excrement </span>in this regard. Just as one may cover the blood of a bird with earth brought in for the purpose of covering excrement, he may likewise use it for covering the blood of a <span class="it-text">koy</span>, as both the case of excrement and the case of the <span class="it-text">koy</span> are cases of uncertainty. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not similar to excrement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the covering of excrement is common, it is regarded as a definite purpose in comparison to a <span class="it-text">koy</span>, which is by definition an uncertain case. It is therefore prohibited to cover the blood of a <span class="it-text">koy</span> with earth prepared for the sake of covering excrement.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Rava is the one who sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is similar to excrement, as Rava said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought in earth to cover excrement with it, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to cover the blood of a bird </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with it; </span>if he did bring in earth to cover <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of a bird, it is prohibited to cover </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excrement with it. </span>One intends to use the earth for the definite rather than the uncertain purpose, and likewise in the case of a <span class="it-text">koy</span>. The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude</span> that this is the correct version of the opinions in the dispute.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami, son of Rav Yeiva, said </span>a different reason: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not cover </span>its blood: It is not because this action would constitute prohibited labor; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree due to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permission of its </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">fat. </span>If one were to cover its blood, people might think that a <span class="it-text">koy</span> is definitely an undomesticated animal, and it is well known that the fats of an undomesticated animal may be eaten, whereas those of a domesticated animal are prohibited. 
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, even on a weekday </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>the blood of a <span class="it-text">koy</span> should not be covered, due to this concern. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">On a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">weekday, </span>people will <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he needs to clean his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>and that he is covering the blood merely to keep his courtyard presentable, rather than to fulfill the mitzva of covering blood.
The Gemara asks: And if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered </span><span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">koy</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a dunghill, </span>a place used for the disposal of refuse, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>It will be evident that he is not concerned about its cleanliness, and that he is attempting to perform the mitzva of covering blood. Alternatively, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he comes to consult </span>a Sage concerning whether or not he should cover the blood of a <span class="it-text">koy</span> on a weekday, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say? </span>If the owner of the <span class="it-text">koy</span> is instructed to cover the blood, would he not come to the erroneous conclusion that its fats are permitted?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">On </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a weekday, even if </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">is uncertain, the Sages </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">take the trouble and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cover </span>it, as it involves the possible fulfillment of a mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">On a Festival, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages say to him: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">take the trouble</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cover </span>it? If one was told to cover the blood on a Festival, this would indicate that a <span class="it-text">koy</span> is definitely an undomesticated animal. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira teaches </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not only did </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the blood of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ko</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span> should not be covered on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if one slaughtered a domesticated animal, </span>whose blood need not be covered, and also slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">an undomesticated animal or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a fowl, </span>whose blood must be covered, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their bloods</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> became mingled together, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to cover </span>the mixture of blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Yasini</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one cannot cover </span>the entire mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">by one thrust </span>of a shovel. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cover it with one thrust, it is permitted. </span>Since the entire amount of blood can be covered with a single action, it does not matter if one unnecessarily covers the blood of a domesticated animal while performing the mitzva of covering the blood of a fowl or an undomesticated animal.
The Gemara comments: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the case; since he covers all the blood in a single action, clearly he performs a mitzva. The Gemara answers: This ruling is nevertheless necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should decree </span>and prohibit even <span class="gemarra-regular">one thrust, due to </span>the possibility that he might perform <span class="gemarra-regular">two thrusts. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yasinia teaches us </span>that this concern is not taken into account. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered a bird on the eve of a Festival, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not cover </span>its blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival </span>itself. 

Daf 9a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">one kneaded doug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival eve, </span>i.e., the day before the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may separate its</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In general, one may not separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes on a Festival. However, since it is permitted bake bread on the Festival for the requirements of the day, and because bread may not be eaten unless <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> has first been separated from it, separating <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> is considered a necessary stage in the preparation of bread, and the Sages permitted it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s father said: Even</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">one kneaded dough on a Festival eve, he may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not separat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the Festival, </span>as he should have separated <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> then. The mitzva of separating <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> goes into effect at the time of the kneading of the dough.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that Shmuel disagrees with his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father, as Shmuel said: </span>With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from outside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Eretz </span>Yisrael, where the separation of <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> is a rabbinic obligation, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may proceed to eat </span>the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward separate </span>the <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> from the remainder of the dough. This statement indicates that the separation of <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> outside of Eretz Yisrael is not required to render the bread permitted, in contrast to the separation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes from produce. Consequently, separating <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> is permitted on a Festival, as it does not involve a significant change. This contradicts the opinion of Shmuel’s father, who prohibited separating <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> that could have been separated before the Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This is not necessarily the case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t Shmuel concede that if one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designated </span>a piece of dough <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> outside of Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to non-priests? </span>This proves that even Shmuel admits that a certain measure of sanctity applies to the <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>. Therefore, he might also agree with his father that it is prohibited to separate <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> on a Festival even outside of Eretz Yisrael.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not carry a ladder, </span>which was used for reaching doves, <span class="gemarra-regular">from one dovecote to another. However, </span>one may move it slightly so that <span class="gemarra-regular">he tilts it from one window </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>in the same dovecote. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel permit </span>even carrying a ladder from one dovecote to another.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan bar Ami said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies only in a case where one moves the ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as Beit Shammai hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sees </span>someone carrying his ladder will <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">need </span>the ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">to plaster his roof, </span>to prevent rainwater from dripping into his house. In other words, an onlooker will suspect him of performing prohibited labor on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his dovecote proves about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> that he is not moving the ladder for the purpose of a transgression, as it is evident that he is placing the ladder alongside the second dovecote, and everyone will understand his intention. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in the private domain, </span>where one will not be observed by strangers, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Wherever the Sages prohibited </span>an action <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the appearanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if one performs the act <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">innermost chamber, </span>where no one will see it, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One whose clothes fell into water on Shabbat or a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">may spread them out </span>to dry <span class="gemarra-regular">in the sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but he may not </span>do so <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the masses, </span>i.e., in a place where people can see him, lest they suspect him of laundering on Shabbat. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Shimon prohibit </span>doing so even in private.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of this discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanan bar Ami said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain, as Beit Shammai are of </span>the opinion that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said, </span>and therefore Beit Shammai apply the decree to the private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel, </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">are of </span>the opinion that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">However, in the public domain, everyone agrees </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to move the ladder.
The Gemara challenges this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Should we say </span>that Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai?</span> According Rav Ḥanan bar Ami, only Beit Shammai maintains that anything prohibited by the Sages due to appearances may not be performed even in private.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: No, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If clothes fell into water on Shabbat or a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spread them out in the sun but not opposite the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> masses. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon prohibit </span>doing so. Rav Ḥanan bar Ami accepts the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, who rejects Rav’s principle. According to the opinion of that <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, it can be claimed that Beit Hillel also rejected Rav’s principle, and they permitted moving the ladder in private but not in public. Rav, on the other hand, follows the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon in interpreting the opinion of Beit Hillel. 

Daf 9b

§ With regard to the mishna itself, the Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry a ladder from one dovecote to another </span>to take doves; <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree only </span>after one has finished at the second dovecote, whether it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to replac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the ladder to its original spot at the first dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai say: One may not replace </span>the ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel say: One may even replace </span>it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement said? With regard to a dovecote ladder, </span>which clearly serves the purpose of taking doves. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of an attic ladder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which has a variety of uses, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>as this will raise suspicions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa says: One may tilt it from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one window to another </span>in the same dovecote. <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rabbi Dosa: One may even shif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the ladder from one place to another by shuffling its legs. 
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons of Rabbi Ḥiyy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> went out to the villages </span>to attend to their business. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they came </span>back, <span class="gemarra-regular">their father</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to them: Did any incident </span>requiring a ruling of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">come to your </span>notice? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: </span>The issue of carrying an attic <span class="gemarra-regular">ladder </span>to a dovecote <span class="gemarra-regular">came to our </span>notice, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we permitted it. </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Go out and prohibi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you permitted. </span>
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an attic ladder, </span>this proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree. </span>Consequently, Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons thought that according to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, Beit Hillel permit even the use of a loft ladder, and they ruled in accordance with this opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is not so, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>does not disagree with him, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he explains </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>can this be inferred? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: One may carry a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ladder from one dovecote to another. And if it enters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your mind </span>to say that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to an attic ladder, </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may carry a ladder from one dovecote </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to another, </span>is inexact, as he <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>have said: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may carry a ladder to a dovecote. Rather, isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this what </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dovecote</span> ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>it is permitted to move it; however, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an attic </span>ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>one may not use it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the others, </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons, what is their reasoning? The Gemara answers that they would reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A dovecote </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ladder? </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: From one dovecote to another, and </span>this simply means that it is permitted to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to several dovecotes.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a slightly different version of this incident. Rabbi Ḥiyya’s sons <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: The tilting of an attic ladder came to our </span>notice, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we permitted it. </span>We were asked whether an attic ladder positioned near a dovecote before the Festival may be moved from one window to another in the same dovecote, and we allowed it. Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Go out and prohibit that which you permitted. </span>The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">they thought</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> That which the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibits, </span>i.e., moving an attic ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permits, </span>i.e. Rabbi Dosa is more lenient than the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and permits moving even an attic ladder from one window to another. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that is not so. </span>Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">that which the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permits, </span>moving a dovecote ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa prohibits. </span>He is more stringent and maintains that even a dovecote ladder may be moved only by tilting rather than in the usual manner.
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>everyone agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may tilt </span>a dovecote ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">from one window to another </span>in the same dovecote. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, with regard to rejoicing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stringent, and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel is lenient. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from the first mishna of the tractate (2a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Beit Shammai say: He may dig </span>earth <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shovel and cover </span>the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not slaughter </span>an undomesticated animal or a fowl, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he had earth prepared </span>for that purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> still day. </span>This indicates that it is Beit Shammai who are concerned for the honor and joy of the Festival, and they are therefore lenient with regard to covering the blood; whereas Beit Hillel do not share the same concern and are stringent about covering the blood, despite the fact that their ruling might adversely affect the joy of the Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The </span>attribution of the <span class="gemarra-regular">opinions </span>of the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is reversed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The opinion attributed to Beit Hillel is actually that of Beit Shammai, and vice versa. The Gemara rejects Rabbi Yoḥanan’s answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you infer that this extreme conclusion is necessarily the case? A different explanation is possible: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Beit Shammai say </span>their opinion, that it is permitted to cover the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, where there is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">a shovel embedded </span>in the earth ready for this purpose, and therefore there are grounds for a lenient ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, where there is no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> embedded shovel, </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it is possible to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel say </span>their opinion, that an act is permitted for the sake of the joy of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">only here, where his dovecote, </span>the place where he ultimately positions the ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">proves </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>that he intended to use his ladder for a permitted purpose; <span class="gemarra-regular">but there, </span>where there is no equivalent proof, they were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>lenient. This shows that there is no clear contradiction between the rulings in the two cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara retracts the previous version and suggests that Rabbi Yoḥanan issued his statement with regard to a different issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult, this is </span>what is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It was taught in a different mishna (10a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: One may not take </span>fledgling doves on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he shook </span>them, as an act of preparation, <span class="gemarra-regular">while</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was still day. And Beit Hillel say: </span>It is indeed necessary to perform some act of preparation to permit the taking of fledglings on a Festival, but this does not have to be done by shaking them. Rather, it is enough if one <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span>the day before <span class="gemarra-regular">and says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">take this </span>dove <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Festival, </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai is stringent and</span> that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel is lenient. And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a contradiction </span>as above: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an undomesticated animal or a fowl on a Festival, </span>Beit Shammai are lenient and allow one to dig with a shovel to cover the blood, due to the joy of the Festival, whereas Beit Hillel do not permit one to slaughtering at all, unless there was a shovel ready from the day before. It was with regard to this contradiction that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The </span>attribution of <span class="gemarra-regular">the opinions</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is reversed. </span>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not so, </span>as a different explanation is possible: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai only state </span>their lenient opinion, that it is permitted to cover the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is an embedded </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shovel. </span>

Daf 10a

<span class="gemarra-regular">However, where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is no embedded shovel, </span>even Beit Shammai did <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> permit it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel say</span> their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since </span>a dove <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is prohibited by rabbinic law, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he stands and says: I will take this and that, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough. However there, </span>where the prohibition applies by Torah law, they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if there is a difficulty </span>involving a contradiction, <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the difficulty, </span>from a different mishna (11a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: One may not take a large pestle </span>from a mortar, which is normally used for crushing wheat in the preparation of porridge, for any other purpose on a Festival, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">to cut meat on it; and Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel permit </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival, </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai is stringent, and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel is lenient. And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters an undomesticated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal or a fowl on a Festival, Beit Shammai </span>say: He may dig earth with a shovel and cover the blood, and Beit Hillel say: He may not slaughter an undomesticated animal or a fowl, unless he had earth prepared for that purpose while it was still day. It was in this regard that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The </span>attribution of the <span class="gemarra-regular">opinions is reversed. </span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you know this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not so. </span>Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where there is a shovel embedded </span>and prepared the day before, <span class="gemarra-regular">but where there is no embedded shovel, </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rule leniently. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>one can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only here, </span>with regard to a pestle, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">has the status of a vessel, </span>and therefore it is not completely <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, there, </span>in the case of slaughtering, Beit Hillel did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>issue a lenient ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if there is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty, this is the difficulty: </span>It is taught in a mishna (11a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may not place </span>an unprocessed <span class="gemarra-regular">hide before those who </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">tread on it, </span>as this is an instance of the prohibited labor of tanning on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not lift </span>the hide from its spot, as it is considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is an olive-bulk of meat on it, </span>in which case it may be carried on account of its meat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel permit </span>one to place a hide before those who will tread upon it.
Once again the Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to rejoicing on the Festival, </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai is stringent, and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lenient. And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a fowl on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival, </span>Beit Shammai say, <span class="gemarra-regular">etc. </span>Concerning this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: The </span>attribution of the <span class="gemarra-regular">opinions is reversed. </span>
Here too, the Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you know this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps that is not so. </span>Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, where there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a shovel embedded </span>and prepared the day before, <span class="gemarra-regular">but where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no embedded shovel, </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rule leniently. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, Beit Hillel say </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only here, </span>with regard to a hide, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is suitable </span>for people <span class="gemarra-regular">to recline </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon, </span>and therefore it is not completely <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, there, </span>in the case of slaughtering, they were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>lenient.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is a difficulty, this is the difficulty, </span>as it is taught (11a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may not remove </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">shutters </span>of a store <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, </span>to open the store by raising them, due to the prohibition against building and demolishing on a Festival; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel permit </span>not only to open the shutters, but <span class="gemarra-regular">even to replace </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, with regard to rejoicing on the Festival, </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai is stringent, and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel is lenient. And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fowl on a Festival, </span>Beit Shammai say, <span class="gemarra-regular">etc. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the contradiction between one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span>and the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as it can be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the slaughtering case, it is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a shovel embedded </span>and prepared the day before; <span class="gemarra-regular">here, there is no embedded shovel, </span>and therefore Beit Shammai are stringent. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the contradiction between one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel </span>and the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>
It is with regard to this contradiction that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The </span>attribution of <span class="gemarra-regular">the opinions is reversed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>one can suggest a different answer without reversing the opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel say </span>their lenient opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in the case of the shutters, <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> they maintain <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is no </span>prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">building with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to vessels and there is no </span>prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">dismantling</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to vessels, </span>which means that no Torah prohibition is violated in removing the shutters. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, there, </span>in the case of slaughtering, where there are no extenuating circumstances, Beit Hillel did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit it. Consequently, there is no contradiction that necessitates a reversal of the opinions.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may not take </span>fledgling doves from a dovecote on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> the ones he wished to take <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>thereby preparing them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>It is not necessary to shake; rather, it is sufficient if one <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span>the day before <span class="gemarra-regular">and says: I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">take this </span>fledgling <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanan bar Ami said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the first pair of fledglings hatched in the first month of the year from a pair of doves. Those fledglings are usually left in the nest and are not used for food. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Beit Shammai hold: We issue a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>prohibiting taking them, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhap</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reconside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> after handling them and decide to leave them in their place, in which case he has moved them unnecessarily. However, once he has already shaken them, there is no further concern that he might change his mind on the Festival itself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel hold: We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not issue a decree, </span>as there is no concern that one might change his mind, and therefore a verbal commitment is sufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to the second brood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the fledglings born on the second cycle in the following month, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough </span>for one <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stand and say: I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">take this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and that</span> one.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, why does one need to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">take this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him say: From here, </span>this dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will take tomorrow. </span>Why does one have to specify exactly which fledglings he plans to remove from the dovecote? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel do not accept </span>the principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>i.e., they reject the idea that a person’s original intention can be clarified retroactively, and therefore it cannot be said that the fledglings one takes on the Festival were the ones he had in mind beforehand, <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ohalot</span> 7:3): If <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">corpse </span>is located <span class="gemarra-regular">in a house, and </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">many entrances, </span>whether they are open or closed, not only is the inside of the house ritually impure as a tent of the dead, but <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the entrances <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>and impart impurity to the vessels they contain? The reason is that the corpse might be removed via any of the entrances, and therefore they all contract impurity.
If only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the entrances <span class="gemarra-regular">was open </span>after the person died, that entrance alone <span class="gemarra-regular">is ritually impure, </span>as the corpse will certainly be removed through it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and all </span>the other entrances remain <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure. </span>The same applies if <span class="gemarra-regular">one decided </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove </span>the corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">through one of </span>the entrances, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>to carry it out <span class="gemarra-regular">through a window that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four by four </span>handbreadths in size, which is large enough for a corpse. This intention <span class="gemarra-regular">spares all the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances</span> from ritual impurity, as it is clear that the corpse will not be removed through them. 
With regard to this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one had decided to remove </span>the corpse by a particular entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">before the person died, </span>so that the entrance through which the body would be removed was already determined at the time of death. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even after the person died, </span>as the principle of retroactive designation is invoked, which means that the entrance through which the deceased will be removed is retroactively designated. This indicates that Beit Hillel do accept the principle of retroactive designation. 
The Gemara refutes this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it stated </span>by <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this </span>mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>In this case, Beit Hillel referred only <span class="gemarra-regular">to purifying the entrances from that point</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forward. </span>In other words, after one has decided on an entrance that he will use to remove the dead, any vessels in the space of the other entrances do not become ritually impure. However, vessels that were located inside the space of the other entrances before the decision was made remain impure. According to these <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>, Beit Hillel do not accept the principle of retroactive designation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, so too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rav Oshaya said: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to purifying the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entrances from that point forward, </span>which indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">From here onward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, yes, </span>the entrances are ritually pure; <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactively, no, </span>they are not considered pure.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that there is a different way to resolve the conflicting rulings of Beit Hillel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>in the case of ritual impurity, Beit Hillel maintain that all the entrances are ritually pure <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactively. And here, </span>with regard to fledglings, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reason </span>why Beit Hillel insist that one designate which particular fledglings one plans to take on the Festival: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps one will move </span>fledglings, <span class="gemarra-regular">and put </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">down</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and again <span class="gemarra-regular">move </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and put </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">down </span>until he finds the pair he wants, thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">moving an object</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is not suitable for him, </span>i.e., which is <span class="it-text">muktze</span>.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if this is indeed the concern, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is enough </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one stands and says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">take this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one. In this case, too, he does not touch them. It is therefore possible that he may reconsider his choice of fledglings on the Festival after he handles them. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> applies only </span>when one made his choice <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Festival. </span>Since he knows that he may not alter his decision on the Festival itself even if he does not like the ones he chose, he definitively decides to take those fledglings and will not handle others. 

Daf 10b

<span class="gemarra-regular">However, on the Festival </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, as sometimes </span>those that seemed to him to be <span class="gemarra-regular">fat ones will be foun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to be <span class="gemarra-regular">thin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and thin ones </span>will be found to be <span class="gemarra-regular">fat, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">move an object that is not suitable for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, </span>thereby transgressing the prohibition against moving <span class="it-text">muktze</span> objects. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, sometimes they will all be found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">thin, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he will leave them </span>all, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he will come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to neglect the rejoicing of the Festival. </span>If, however, one announces the day before: I will take this one and that one, he will indeed take only those fledglings, thereby enhancing his Festival joy. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If, on the eve of a Festival, one <span class="gemarra-regular">designated black </span>fledglings to be slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>on the following day <span class="gemarra-regular">found white </span>ones in the dovecote, rather than the birds he had designated, or if one designated <span class="gemarra-regular">white </span>ones to be slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">and found black </span>ones, or if one designated <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>fledglings to be slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found three, they are prohibited, </span>as these are not the same fledglings he had designated earlier. If, however, one designated <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>to be slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">and found </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">two, they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as it is presumed that one of the fledglings escaped.
If one designated them <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the nest </span>and the next day he cannot find them there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he found </span>fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">before the nest, they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>as they might be fledglings other than the ones he designated and left inside the nest. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are only those </span>fledglings in the immediate vicinity, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted, </span>as it can be assumed that these are the ones he designated inside the nest. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: But it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if one designated black ones to be slaughtered and found white ones, they are not the same birds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: With what are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we dealing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one designated </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">black and white </span>ones to be slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he arose and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">black ones</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the place </span>where the <span class="gemarra-regular">white ones </span>had been, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> white ones in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">black ones. Lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say: These are those </span>same fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they simply <span class="gemarra-regular">exchanged </span>places, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this claim is not accepted. Instead, it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>ones that he designated <span class="gemarra-regular">have gone to the </span>outside <span class="gemarra-regular">world, and these</span> ones that he found <span class="gemarra-regular">are others </span>that have come from elsewhere.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">supports Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>When resolving an uncertainty with regard to the identity of an item, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">majority </span>indicates one ruling but the item in question is <span class="gemarra-regular">proximat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to a source that indicates otherwise, one <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the majority. </span>In this case, the majority of fledglings are prohibited, as they were not designated for use on the Festival. Consequently, the found fledglings are prohibited, despite the fact that the nearest fledglings are the designated ones.
The Gemara refutes this suggestion: Perhaps it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Abaye said </span>with regard to a different issue: We are dealing with fledglings located <span class="gemarra-regular">on a ledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a flat piece of wood protruding from the dovecote, around which many doves congregate. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a ledge. </span>Since other doves are regularly found there, the principle that one follows the majority rather than the proximate source does not apply, as both the majority of doves and the proximate source of doves are not the original ones, and therefore all the fledglings are prohibited.
The mishna taught that if one designated <span class="gemarra-regular">two and found three, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are prohibited. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>look at this matter, the fledglings are prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">If these are others</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they are other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that have not been designated. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if they are not others, </span>i.e., two of the fledglings that one designated are still there, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>that he certainly did not designate and <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mingled with them, </span>which renders the others prohibited as well. 
§ The mishna taught that if one designated <span class="gemarra-regular">three and found two</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are the same ones, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one of them has gone to the </span>outside <span class="gemarra-regular">world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> leaving two behind. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that the mishna is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>of tithe money in a safe place <span class="gemarra-regular">and found two hundre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> there, it is assumed that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">and second-tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> money <span class="gemarra-regular">mingled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">together. </span>Someone must have come and added another hundred to his tithe money. Therefore, he separates one dinars from the total and states: Whatever part of this is the tithe, is fine; whatever part of it is non-tithe money, let it be used to redeem the tithe money, and this should be sanctified as tithe money in its place. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis say: It is all non-sacre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> money. Since the money is not as he left it, the assumption is that someone took the original one hundred dinars; and he, or someone else, replaced it with two hundred dinars of regular money.
Conversely, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">placed two hundred </span>dinars <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found one hundred dinars, </span>it is presumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dinars has been left </span>in its place and is tithe money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one hundred dinars </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">removed. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is all non-sacred </span>money. It is assumed that someone removed all the money, and the one hundred dinars he found must have been placed there by someone else, and is not connected to the money he left. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the case of fledglings apparently follows Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion in the case of second-tithe money.
The Gemara refutes this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it can be explained, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it was stated with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this </span>mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: Fledglings are different, since they typically hop </span>from place to place. Therefore, it is possible that one of them escaped. By contrast, a money pouch cannot move of its own accord and must have been taken by someone. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to answer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to it: Fledglings are different, since they typically</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hop? But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</span> mishna, which deals with a money pouch, <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Elazar </span>disagree over it: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two pouches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with one hundred dinars in each pouch. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if all of the money was <span class="gemarra-regular">in a single pouch, everyone agrees</span> that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>money, as it is unlikely that only half of the money was removed while the other half was left in its place. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">to one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pouch, but with regard to two pouches, everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred dinars </span>of tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">is left and one hundred</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dinars </span>has been <span class="gemarra-regular">removed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute</span> deals with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of two pouches, this is </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary to answer here: Fledglings are different, since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they typically hop. However, according to the one who says</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>involves a case <span class="gemarra-regular">of one pouch, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to two pouches everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dinars </span>of tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">is left and one hundred dinars </span>has been <span class="gemarra-regular">removed, now </span>consider: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to answer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, with regard to it, </span>that there is a difference between that <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and the case of fledglings? <span class="gemarra-regular">You said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not disagree </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">pouches, </span>and therefore they certainly do not disagree in the case of fledglings.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Here we are dealing with fledglings tied </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> with money <span class="gemarra-regular">pouches tied </span>together. In other words, when it is stated that the dispute applies to one pouch, this refers to two pouches that are tied together, as well. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the rabbis agree only with regard to two pouches that are entirely separate. Consequently, it is necessary to explain that there is a difference between pouches tied together and fledglings tied together: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fledglings </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">release themselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>and therefore it is possible that only one of them escaped, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">pouches cannot release themselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from each other. </span>Therefore, it is evident that someone must have taken them. Since they were tied together, he certainly took both of them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is indeed the case, and it is obvious that someone came and took the money, what is Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s reasoning? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Pouches, too, sometimes </span>

Daf 11a

<span class="gemarra-regular">their knot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">becomes worn </span>and untied. Consequently, it is possible that someone took only one of the two pouches.
§ The mishna taught that if one designated fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">inside the nest and found </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">before the nest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">they are prohibited. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>In a case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">a majority and </span>an item that is <span class="gemarra-regular">near, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the majority. </span>Since doves from the outside world are more numerous than those that one designated, the assumption is that these fledglings are from the majority, and therefore they are prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said, </span>in refutation of this claim: Here we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a ledg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> affixed to the front of the nest, where all the doves gather. Therefore, the principle pertaining to a majority and an item that is near does not apply to this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>Here <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are dealing with two nests, one above the other, </span>i.e., adjacent nests rather than any two nests. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is not necessary </span>to state that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">designated </span>the fledglings in <span class="gemarra-regular">the lower </span>nest <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not designate </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">in the upper one, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he found </span>fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">in the lower one and he did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not find </span>fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">in the upper one, that </span>the fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that we say: These </span>that were in the lower nest <span class="gemarra-regular">went to the </span>outside <span class="gemarra-regular">world, while these </span>still present <span class="gemarra-regular">have dragged themselves and come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">down. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if one designated </span>fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">in the upper </span>nest <span class="gemarra-regular">and did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not designate </span>fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">in the lower </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and found </span>fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">in the upper one and did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> find </span>fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">in the lower one, those </span>in the upper nest <span class="gemarra-regular">are also prohibited, as we say: Those </span>that he originally designated <span class="gemarra-regular">went to the </span>outside <span class="gemarra-regular">world, and those </span>in the lower nest <span class="gemarra-regular">have clutched and climbed. </span>Therefore, there is cause for concern in both of these cases.
The mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there are no </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">there apart from them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they are permitted. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? If we say </span>that the mishna is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>fledglings that <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">able </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">fly</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>is possible <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>that he designated <span class="gemarra-regular">went to the</span> outside <span class="gemarra-regular">world, and the ones </span>that are present <span class="gemarra-regular">are other</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ones. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna must be referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>fledglings that can only <span class="gemarra-regular">hop </span>from one place to another. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it deals with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>another dove <span class="gemarra-regular">nest within fifty cubits, </span>the fledglings might have <span class="gemarra-regular">jumped </span>and come from that nest; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no nest within fifty cubits, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are permitted, </span>for from where could they have come? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Mar Ukva bar Ḥama said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>creature <span class="gemarra-regular">that hops, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not hop more than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fifty cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">nest within fifty cubits, and </span>it deals with a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the additional nest <span class="gemarra-regular">is situated around</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a corne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> from the first nest, rather than in a straight line from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: </span>The fledglings <span class="gemarra-regular">jumped </span>from one nest to the other, the mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that </span>a fledgling <span class="gemarra-regular">hops and turns</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sees its nest, it will </span>continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">hop. But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>it can <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>longer see its original nest, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not hop </span>any farther.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may not take a large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pestl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from a mortar, which is normally used for crushing wheat in the preparation of porridge, for any other purpose on a Festival, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">to cut meat on it; and Beit Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permit </span>it. Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place </span>an unprocessed <span class="gemarra-regular">hide before those who </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">tread on</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as this constitutes the prohibited labor of tanning on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the hide from its place, as it is considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is an olive-bulk of meat on it, </span>in which case it may be carried on account of its meat; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel permit </span>it in both cases.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that if one </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">cu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">meat </span>he needs for the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the pestle, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to move </span>the pestle farther on the Festival. The reason is that the vessel is <span class="it-text">muktze</span> as a utensil whose primary function is a prohibited use, and therefore it is permitted to handle it only when one requires it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pestle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> however, in </span>the case of a wooden anvil used <span class="gemarra-regular">for breaking bones, everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted. </span>The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A pestle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Why would one think that an object not even mentioned in the mishna is prohibited?
The Gemara answers: Abaye’s statement is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: The same is true, </span>i.e., Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard to a wooden anvil used <span class="gemarra-regular">for breaking bones; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>the mishna specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: A pestle, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to convey the far-reaching nature of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they permitted </span>moving <span class="gemarra-regular">even an object whose </span>primary <span class="gemarra-regular">function </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">for a prohibited </span>use. Abaye therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to a wooden anvil used for breaking bones.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say</span> a different version of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is necessary </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">only: Even a new </span>wooden anvil used <span class="gemarra-regular">for breaking bones </span>is also permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">one will reconsider and not break </span>bones <span class="gemarra-regular">on it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but rather set it aside for a different purpose, Abaye therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not a concern. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is that so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Are Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shammai not concerned </span>about the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one might <span class="gemarra-regular">reconsider? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Beitza</span> 1:13): <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: </span>On a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not lead a butcher</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a knife </span>in hand <span class="gemarra-regular">to an animal </span>located far from him, so that he can slaughter it; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>may one lead <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal to a butcher with a knife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>lest he reconsider, in which case he will have handled the knife unnecessarily, which is prohibited; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may lead </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from one to the other, </span>as they are not concerned about unnecessary use of the knife.
By the same reasoning, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not bring spices or a pestle to a mortar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">nor a mortar to spices and a pestle, </span>as he might change his mind and will have handled these utensils on the Festival for no purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One may bring one to the other, </span>as there is no concern that he may reconsider. This shows that Beit Shammai are, in general, concerned that one might reconsider, as they prohibit one to handle items for this reason.
The Gemara refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? Granted, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal, one </span>is liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">come to reconsider, as </span>he might <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Let us leave </span>aside <span class="gemarra-regular">this animal, </span>as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">thin, and we will bring a different animal, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fatter than it. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pot, too, one </span>is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">to come to reconsider, as </span>he might <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Let us leave </span>aside <span class="gemarra-regular">this pot </span>of cooked food, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires spices </span>and would take great effort to prepare, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I will bring a different one that does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> require spices </span>and can be cooked as it is. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to a wooden anvil used for breaking bones, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>Will one <span class="gemarra-regular">reconsider and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not break </span>the bones? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he has slaughtered </span>an animal, it <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span>ready for its bones <span class="gemarra-regular">to be broken, </span>as it cannot be eaten in any other way.
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may not place </span>an unprocessed <span class="gemarra-regular">hide </span>before the one who will tread on it. The Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>(<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Beitza</span> 1:13): <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may salt meat for roasting on </span>this hide, and there is no concern that some of the salt will fall on the hide, which would be similar to tanning the hide by salting. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: They taught </span>that one may salt meat <span class="gemarra-regular">only for roasting, </span>in which case it is not salted a great deal. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in the case of meat <span class="gemarra-regular">for a pot, </span>i.e., for cooking, the Sages did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say that one may salt it on the hide, as meat must be well-salted on all sides before cooking, and a large amount of salt will inevitably spill onto the hide.
The Gemara asks: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>the one may not salt meat <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>cooking in a pot, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> just cited: <span class="gemarra-regular">For roasting, </span>and not for cooking. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This</span> comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us that even </span>the permission to salt meat <span class="gemarra-regular">for roasting </span>applies only if one does so in the usual manner. However, if one salts it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> manner of </span>meat salted to be cooked in <span class="gemarra-regular">a pot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which requires more salt than is necessary for roasting, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>On a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not salt the fats </span>of an animal, which is done so that they will not decompose and emit a foul odor. This is true even if the animal was slaughtered on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not turn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them over</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The fats are unfit for use on the Festival, and therefore they are <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: One may spread </span>the fats <span class="gemarra-regular">out in the wind on pegs </span>to prevent them from decaying. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary. </span>Otherwise, <span class="gemarra-regular">it might enter your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind to say </span>that since this is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">many, </span>one should apply the principal that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">many. </span>Rav Mattana therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that, in this case, the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the individual. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>In a case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">many</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">many. </span>The Gemara answers: This ruling is nevertheless necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehoshua’s opinion is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable, for if you do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not permit him </span>to air out the fats, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> refrain and not slaughter </span>an animal at all. Rav Mattana therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this factor is not taken into consideration.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>placing <span class="gemarra-regular">a hide before those who will tread </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on it, </span>which Beit Hillel, whose ruling is accepted as <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, permit for the very reason that, if one is not allowed to do so, he will refrain from slaughtering animals? 

Daf 11b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of spreading out the hide, <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter is not </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">eviden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that it is spread out for tanning <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> in its current state, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fit to recline on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore it can be said that one placed it for this purpose. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to fats, he himself might <span class="gemarra-regular">come to say: What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages permitted </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to me? So that it will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not emit a foul odor. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if I <span class="gemarra-regular">spread them out, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if I <span class="gemarra-regular">salt them? </span>This reasoning will lead one to salt hides, which is a prohibited labor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: A person may salt</span> on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">several piece</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of meat at one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time, although he requires </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one piece, </span>as it is all one act of salting. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">employ artific</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and salt bone </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">bone. </span>After salting one bone, he would say: I prefer this one instead, and would thereby salt all the meat in his possession.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not remove </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">shutters [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">terisin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of a store <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, </span>due to the prohibition against building and demolishing. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel permit </span>one not only to open the shutters, but <span class="gemarra-regular">even to replace </span>them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>are these <span class="gemarra-regular">shutters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">shutters of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shops</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The marketplace shops or stalls were large crates or wagons, not buildings. They were closed at night with shutters. The shopkeepers would open the shutters on the Festival so that people who did not manage to finish all of their Festival preparations before the Festival could take the articles they required and settle accounts with the storekeeper later. Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disputed whether the shutters may be opened and closed on the Festival itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">three matters, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>an action <span class="gemarra-regular">whose result </span>is undesirable <span class="gemarra-regular">in order</span> to encourage a desirable <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>action. <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are </span>the three matters: First, they permitted spreading out the <span class="gemarra-regular">hide </span>of an animal slaughtered on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">before those </span>who will <span class="gemarra-regular">tread on it, </span>a stage in its tanning. This was permitted because the Sages wish to encourage slaughtering the animal to enable celebration on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>second, the Sages permitted the replacement of <span class="gemarra-regular">shutters of shops </span>on a Festival, so that storeowners could supply the Festival requirements for those in need. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the third permitted action is <span class="gemarra-regular">the replacement of a bandag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Temple. </span>If a priest had an injury on his hand, he would have to remove the bandage while performing the Temple service, as it is prohibited for any item to interpose between his hand and whatever he must handle as part of the rite. After concluding his Temple service, he was allowed to replace the bandage on Shabbat, despite the fact that this is ordinarily prohibited, so as not to discourage him from engaging in Temple service.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Raḥava </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>one other matter, i.e., another instance where the Sages permitted an action whose result was undesirable in order to encourage a desirable initial action. This concerns a <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span>, a member of a group that is meticulous with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">who opens his barrel </span>of wine or prepares <span class="gemarra-regular">and begins </span>to sell <span class="gemarra-regular">his dough </span>to pilgrims <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of the Festival.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who said: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may finish </span>selling all the bread made from that dough and all the wine in the barrel. Wine or dough sold to the general public is usually classified as ritually impure, as it might have been touched by an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>, one who is not careful with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity. During a Festival, however, the Sages decreed that all wine and dough sold in Jerusalem is ritually pure, so as not to embarrass ignorant people, and they may therefore be bought even by a <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span>. Rabbi Yehuda adds that even if a large quantity of wine or dough remains after the Festival, it retains its status as ritually pure and one may continue to sell it to a <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span>. This is a case of permitting an action whose result is undesirable for the sake of an initial action, in that the Sages maintained the wine and dough’s status as ritually pure after the Festival in order to encourage people to sell wine and dough on the Festival. 
With regard to Ulla’s statement, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one may spread out an animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hide before those </span>who will <span class="gemarra-regular">tread on it. </span>Why did Ulla find it necessary to restate an explicit teaching of a mishna? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason of Beit Hillel </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the hide <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit for reclining on it, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the animal was slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of the Festival, </span>it would <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be permitted to spread out its hide on the Festival. Ulla therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the reason for the leniency is that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>an action <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">result </span>was undesirable <span class="gemarra-regular">in order </span>to encourage a desirable <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>action. Consequently, in the case of an animal slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">on a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival, yes, </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies; but with regard to one that was slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of a Festival, no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one may not spread out its hide.
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="gemarra-regular">shutters of shops as well, </span>as the mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel permit </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">even to replace them. </span>The Gemara explains: This, too, is necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hillel’s reason </span>for being lenient <span class="gemarra-regular">is that there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no </span>prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">building </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to vessels and no</span> prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">dismantling </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to vessels. </span>Since these shops are not attached to the ground, they are vessels rather than houses, and it is therefore permitted to replace their shutters; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as a result, the dismantlement and replacement of shutters of large vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">even of </span>those found in <span class="gemarra-regular">houses, </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">als</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> be permitted. To counter this logic, Ulla therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the reason the Sages allowed the replacement of shutters of shops on a Festival is because they <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>an action <span class="gemarra-regular">whose result </span>is undesirable <span class="gemarra-regular">in order</span> to encourage a desirable <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>action. Consequently, in the case of the shutters <span class="gemarra-regular">of shops, yes, </span>they permitted their replacement; in the case of those <span class="gemarra-regular">of houses, no, </span>they did not allow it.
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the replacement of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bandage in the Temple as well: One may replace a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bandage in the Temple but not in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country. </span>The Gemara explains that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: What is the reason </span>that a bandage may be replaced? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because rabbinic decrees prohibiting labor</span> do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the prohibition against applying a bandage is by rabbinic law, this leniency should apply to all who are in the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">a priest who is not a candidate </span>to perform the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service. </span>Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not the case; rather, it is an instance where the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted a result for the sake of an initial action</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If one is a candidate for service, yes, </span>he may replace his bandage; <span class="gemarra-regular">if one is not a candidate for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> service, no, </span>he may not replace his bandage.
The Gemara asks a similar question with regard to Raḥava’s addition: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opens his barrel </span>of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who opens his barre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> to sell its wine, and similarly in the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">begins</span> selling <span class="gemarra-regular">his dough for the sake of the Festival, </span>the substance is ritually pure. If some is left over, the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disputed whether it retains its presumed status as ritually pure after the Festival and one may continue to sell it to a <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may finish </span>selling the wine or dough, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: He may not finish. </span>What is added by including it in the list of matters where a result is permitted for the sake of an initial action? 
The Gemara explains: Raḥava’s statement is necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: </span>It is permitted to finish selling the wine or dough because <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages rendered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ritual impurity of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival as ritually pure, and although one did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">begin </span>to sell this wine or dough on the Festival but at an earlier stage, he should <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>be permitted to finish, as items do not contract ritual impurity on a Festival. To counter this logic, Raḥava therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us: </span>In this case, too, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>an action <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">result </span>is undesirable <span class="gemarra-regular">in order </span>to encourage a desirable <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>action. <span class="gemarra-regular">If one had begun, yes, </span>he may finish selling; <span class="gemarra-regular">if one had not begun, no, </span>he may not do so.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ulla, what is the reason that he did he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not state this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> alongside the other cases he listed? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is not dealing with </span>a case that is a matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He listed only cases where the ruling is unanimous. The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>other three matters <span class="gemarra-regular">are also </span>subject to <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute, </span>as they all involve a disagreement between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. The Gemara answers: When <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span>express an opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">where Beit Hillel </span>disagree, Beit Shammai’s opinion is not considered a legitimate opinion in the <span class="gemarra-regular">Mishna, </span>and it is completely disregarded. Since everyone knows that Beit Shammai’s opinion is entirely rejected by <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, it is not taken into consideration. Therefore, those cases are not viewed as disputes at all. 
§ The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agree that one may remove shutters on a Festival. They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree only </span>as to whether it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to replac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> them, as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Beit Shammai say: One may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not replace </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: One may even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">replace </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>these shutters <span class="gemarra-regular">have a hing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that can be inserted into a slot in the side of the vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not have a hinge, everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted, </span>as this is merely replacement of a board, and it is not similar to building.
The Gemara challenges this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>What is the situation in which Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree? They disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the shutters <span class="gemarra-regular">do not have a hinge; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">however, if they have a hinge, everyone agrees </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. Abaye said </span>that the two sources can be reconciled: <span class="gemarra-regular">When they have a hinge on the side, everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>as the placement of a hinge in the side is a complicated endeavor that resembles building. If <span class="gemarra-regular">they have no hinge at all, everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted, </span>as it is considered merely the replacement of a board. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they have a hinge in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the middle </span>rather than on the side. 

Daf 12a

One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Beit Shammai, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">issue a decree </span>and prohibit <span class="gemarra-regular">a hinge in the middle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to a hinge on the side; and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Beit Hillel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not issue </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">decree. </span>Since placing a hinge of this type does not constitute the prohibited labor of building, it is permitted.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry out </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">neither a minor </span>child, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lulav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor a Torah Scroll into the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain, </span>as none of these are required for the preparation of food; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel permit </span>it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who reviews <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span> a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi: One who slaughters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a gift </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival is flogged </span>for transgressing the prohibition: “No manner of work shall be done on them” (Exodus 12:16). Since this slaughtering was not performed for the purpose of eating, the action constitutes a prohibited labor on a Festival. 
Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>that <span class="it-text">tanna</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to you? It is </span>evidently in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say: Since carrying out was permitted </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose </span>of food preparation, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also permitted not for that purpose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> For if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hillel, they say: Since carrying out was permitted for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requirements </span>of food preparation, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was also permitted not for</span> these <span class="gemarra-regular">requirements. Here, too, </span>with regard to the prohibited labor of slaughtering, <span class="gemarra-regular">since slaughter was permitted for the requirements </span>of food preparation, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was also permitted not for </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">requirements</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>It was permitted for any purpose that benefits people, whether directly or indirectly. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba strongly objects to this </span>reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you infer <span class="gemarra-regular">that Beit Shammai and Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hillel disagree over this </span>issue? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps they disagree </span>about the following: The <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying out </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor </span>a prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying out </span>on a Festival. 
The Gemara clarifies the dispute according to this explanation: One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Beit Shammai, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> and the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying out </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat, and</span> similarly the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying out </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival. </span>The only difference is that, on a Festival, carrying, like other types of prohibited labor, is permitted for the sake of food preparation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Beit Hillel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> and the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying out </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no</span> <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> nor a prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying out on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival, as it is written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neither carry forth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a burden out of your houses on the Shabbat day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Jeremiah 17:22), from which Beit Hillel inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">On Shabbat, yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>carrying from one domain to another is indeed prohibited; <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival, no, </span>it is not prohibited. According to this explanation, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about whether a prohibited labor that is permitted for the purpose of food preparation on a Festival is also permitted when it does not serve that purpose.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef strongly objects</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this </span>explanation of Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that the dispute is whether the prohibition against carrying out applies on a Festival, Beit Hillel should permit one to move <span class="it-text">muktze</span> objects, as the prohibition of handling <span class="it-text">muktze</span> is an extension of the prohibition against carrying out. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them differ with regard to </span>whether or not it is permitted to carry out <span class="gemarra-regular">stones </span>on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, from</span> the fact that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree with regard to stones </span>but concerning objects that serve some sort of purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this: </span>Everyone agrees that carrying out is prohibited on a Festival, and the Torah permitted it only when it is necessary for sustenance. 
Instead, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to carrying out </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the purpose </span>of food preparation. According to the opinion of Beit Hillel, since carrying out is permitted for the sake of sustenance, it is entirely permitted. According to Beit Shammai, the Sages permitted only labor that serves the purpose of food preparation.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds </span>that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since carrying out is permitted </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> purpose </span>of food preparation, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was also permitted not for</span> this <span class="gemarra-regular">purpose, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: One who cooks the sciatic nerv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in milk</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival and eats it is flogged </span>for violating <span class="gemarra-regular">fiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> distinct prohibitions. 
How so? (1) <span class="gemarra-regular">He is flogged due to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">cooking </span>the sciatic <span class="gemarra-regular">nerve, </span>which is prohibited because the sciatic nerve is unfit for consumption; (2) <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is flogged due to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">eating </span>the sciatic <span class="gemarra-regular">nerve, </span>which is explicitly prohibited by the Torah; (3) <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is flogged due to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">cooking meat in milk; </span>(4) <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is flogged </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">eating meat </span>cooked <span class="gemarra-regular">in milk; </span>(5) <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>lastly, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is flogged</span>

Daf 12b

<span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">kindlin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> a fire on a Festival.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>that <span class="it-text">tanna</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Leave </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and teach it outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not fit for discussion in the study hall. The opinion that there is a prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">kindling and cookin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a mishna </span>worthy of serious consideration. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a mishna </span>rather than an error, this statement is still not in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>following the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, who say: We do not say: Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carrying out was permitted </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purposes</span> of food preparation, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was also permitted </span>when performed <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">purposes. Here, too, </span>we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> kindling was permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purposes </span>of food preparation, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was also permitted </span>when performed <span class="gemarra-regular">not for </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">purposes. </span>
The Gemara explains why the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cannot be attributed to Beit Hillel. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one were to suggest that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> follows the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, </span>this cannot be the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: Since carrying out was permitted for the purposes </span>of food preparation, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was also permitted </span>when performed <span class="gemarra-regular">not for </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">purposes. Here, too, since kindling was permitted for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">purposes </span>of food preparation, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was also permitted </span>when performed <span class="gemarra-regular">not for </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">purposes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, according to the opinion of Beit Hillel, kindling cannot be included amongst those prohibitions for which one is liable on a Festival.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The separation of <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> is permitted on a Festival, as one is permitted to prepare dough and bake it on a Festival, and bread may not be eaten without first separating <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not bring </span>separated <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥall</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>any of the other priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw of a slaughtered animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest on a Festival, </span>though it is permitted to separate them from an animal slaughtered on a Festival. This is prohibited regardless of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they were separated last evening, </span>i.e., before the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether they were separated today. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel permit </span>it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai said to </span>Beit Hillel: This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> can be derived by <span class="gemarra-regular">an analogy: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts </span>are both considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the priest, and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> separated from produce is also <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift to the priest. Just as </span>you agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not bring </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> to a priest on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, one may not bring the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them: No, </span>this analogy is incorrect. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you said </span>that you derive the halakha from <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">its separation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not allowed </span>on the Festival, how <span class="gemarra-regular">will you say</span> the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the gifts </span>from an animal or <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>, concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">which their separation is allowed </span>on the Festival? Since it is not prohibited to separate these gifts, they may likewise be brought to a priest. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind </span>to explain <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>when the mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">They were separated today, </span>it means: From animals <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered today</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">They were separated last evening, </span>is referring to animals <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered last evening. </span>The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose opinion is </span>expressed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not Rabbi Yosei nor Rabbi Yehuda, but </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not dispute</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to gifts separated on the eve of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival, that one may bring </span>them to a priest on a Festival day itself along <span class="gemarra-regular">with gifts separated that day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered that day. They disputed only</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of bringing </span>gifts separated the day before <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> themselves, as Beit Shammai say: One may not bring </span>these gifts by themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: One may bring</span> them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Shammai would reason as follows: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and gifts</span> from a slaughtered animal are <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift to the priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift to the priest. Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may not bring </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> to a priest on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, one may not bring the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Beit Hillel said to them: No, </span>granted, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that separation is not allowed </span>on a Festival, but how <span class="gemarra-regular">will you say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts, </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">which separation is allowed </span>on the Festival? It is therefore permitted to bring these gifts to a priest as well. This is Rabbi Yehuda’s interpretation of the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, according to which Beit Shammai prohibit bringing even gifts separated on the Festival itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: </span>That is not the correct record of the dispute, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not dispute about </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the gifts </span>from an animal to a priest on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disputed only with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shammai say: One may not bring </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: One may </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and gifts </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the priest, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift to the priest. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Just as one may bring the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, one may bring </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: No; if you said </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts, </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">which their separation is allowed </span>on the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">will you say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whose separation is not allowed? </span>
<span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the dispute was as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not dispute with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that one may not bring </span>it to a priest on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disputed only </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts, as Beit Shammai say: One may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bring </span>the other gifts, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: One may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bring </span>them. The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara does not even suggest that the mishna might be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, as it is clear that it cannot be reconciled with his explanation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Is it taught </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">They were separated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that day and were slaughtered that day? </span>No; <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They were separated, and actually </span>the mishna should be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">They were slaughtered last evening </span>and separated today, which is exactly what Rabbi Yehuda said. The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it can still be claimed that, in their opinion, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disputed the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of these </span>animals that <span class="gemarra-regular">were slaughtered last evening</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>not those slaughtered on the Festival.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is </span>the same opinion as that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>What, then, is the difference between the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and <span class="it-text">Aḥerim</span>? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">secondary </span>gifts. If one has gifts separated before a Festival, is he permitted to join them as secondary gifts along with others separated on the Festival and transport them together to a priest? Rabbi Yehuda maintains that secondary gifts may be brought to a priest, according to the opinion of Beit Hillel, whereas <span class="it-text">Aḥerim</span> prohibit it. 
With regard to the dispute cited in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. </span>The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tovi, son of Rabbi Neḥemya, had a bottle of </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He came before Rav Yosef </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">bringing </span>this wine <span class="gemarra-regular">to a priest now, </span>on a Festival? Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: That is what Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who maintains that Beit Hillel permit one to bring <span class="it-text">teruma</span> to a priest on a Festival, and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with their opinion.
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The host of Rava, son of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanan, had bundles of </span>unprocessed <span class="gemarra-regular">mustard, </span>whose seeds remained in their stems. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span>to his guest, the Sage: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to crushing </span>these mustard stalks <span class="gemarra-regular">and eating from them on a Festival? </span>Rava, son of Rav Ḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have </span>an answer readily available, so he <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava </span>to ask his opinion. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that it was taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may husk </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kernel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by rubbing them between one’s fingers, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">crush legumes on a Festival. </span>This statement indicates that it is permitted to crush mustard stalks. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection to </span>Rava from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who husks kernels </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat eve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, on the following day, </span>on Shabbat itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may winno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> the chaff in an irregular manner by passing the kernels <span class="gemarra-regular">from hand to hand and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may not </span>do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tray [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kanon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that is occasionally used for sorting and separating the chaff <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with a large vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who husks kernels </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival eve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, on the following day, he may winnow a little </span>grain <span class="gemarra-regular">at a tim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and eat, even with a tray </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or a large vessel. However, he may not </span>do so <span class="gemarra-regular">with a tablet, nor with a winnow, nor with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sieve. </span>Since these vessels are designed for winnowing, they are used only for large quantities, and therefore it will appear as though he were preparing for after the Festival, which is certainly prohibited. In any case, the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">On a Festival eve, yes, </span>one may husk or crush legumes; <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>it is prohibited to do so.
The Gemara refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be understood. The reason is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">On Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve, </span>as husking grain may not be performed on Shabbat itself, for it might lead to a prohibited labor on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he also taught in the latter clause: On a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival eve. </span>However, this does not mean that rubbing or crushing legumes is prohibited on the Festival itself. 
Abaye raises a difficulty against the opinion of Rava from a different angle: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you say <span class="gemarra-regular">so, we </span>have thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for which separation is allowed</span> on a Festival. Before being rubbed, the grains of wheat were certainly not fit to be eaten, and therefore there was no obligation to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from them. Now that one has prepared them as food by rubbing them, he is obligated to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from them, and if one is permitted to eat them, he must be permitted to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from them first. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>explicitly in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, if you said </span>that you derive the halakha from <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">its separation is not allowed</span> on the Festival. This statement indicates that even Beit Hillel agree that one may not separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of any kind on a Festival.
The Gemara refutes this challenge: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>

Daf 13a

<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>source, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that one must separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from kernels of grain on the stalk, and one may separate <span class="it-text">terumot</span> on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>source, the mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who maintains that there is no need to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from kernels of grain on the stalk, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought inside </span>his house <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks </span>of grain in order to grind them into flour and <span class="gemarra-regular">to make dough from them, he may eat from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, as a snack, </span>before they are ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is exempt </span>from <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. Provided that the grain has not yet been fully processed, the obligation to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> does not apply. The Sages decreed that such produce may only be consumed casually and not as part of a regular meal.
However, if from the outset one brought in the stalks of grain not to grind them but <span class="gemarra-regular">to husk the kernels </span>and eat them a little at a time, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">obligates </span>him to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from them and prohibits him from partaking of the grain until he has done so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempts </span>him from the obligation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. He maintains that not even this intention renders one obligated to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, as the obligation for <span class="it-text">teruma</span> applies only to fully processed grain.
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>you can <span class="gemarra-regular">also find </span>a case when one must separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from grain that has not been fully processed. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, if one brought inside</span> his house <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks of grain to make dough from them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>thereby rendering himself obligated to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he reconsidered </span>and decided <span class="gemarra-regular">to husk them </span>in order to eat the kernels <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed </span>produce takes effect <span class="gemarra-regular">on that day </span>and one is obligated to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, only afterward is he permitted to eat the kernels.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must say: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree may not be separated on a Festival? It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">most </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>e.g., grain that has been threshed and gathered into piles on the eve of the Festival. They do, however, admit that there are exceptional cases in which one may separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> on a Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute, </span>concerning when the obligation to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and the prohibition of untithed produce takes effect, is referring only <span class="gemarra-regular">to stalks </span>of grain, which are typically brought into a granary, where they are processed in a standard manner. Until that point, the grain is not prohibited as untithed produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">legumes, everyone agrees </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles </span>are already regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce, </span>and <span class="it-text">teruma</span> must be separated from them at that stage. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say that </span>the following mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">supports him </span>(<span class="it-text">Terumot</span> 10:6): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who had bundles of fenugreek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of legume, <span class="gemarra-regular">of untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pound </span>these bundles to remove the seeds from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he calculate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> how many seeds </span>the bundles <span class="gemarra-regular">contain and separates</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> based <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds, but </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>calculate and <span class="gemarra-regular">separate </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> based <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks. </span>Although the stalks and leaves are also used for cooking, it is not necessary to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>the case that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda, who said: There, </span>with regard to stalks of grain, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet ready to be tithed, and therefore not prohibited as <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>i.e., with regard to the bundles of fenugreek, it is ready to be tithed and therefore prohibited as <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is no proof, as it can be claimed that the mishna dealing with fenugreek <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who obligates one to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> in the case of stalks of grain. The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, what novel element does the mishna provide? <span class="gemarra-regular">Why specifically </span>discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">fenugreek? </span>According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even to stalks </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">as well.</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>then? Is the mishna in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him teach us </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">other types of legumes, </span>i.e., that they have the status of untithed produce when placed in bundles. <span class="gemarra-regular">And all the more so </span>this would apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">fenugreek, </span>which is eaten only in small quantities and is not processed in the manner of grain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it cannot be proven that the mishna follows either the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, or that of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary </span>for the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> to state the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">fenugreek </span>for a different reason: It could <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say: Since </span>in the case of fenugreek <span class="gemarra-regular">the taste of its stalk and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its fruit </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">identical, </span>as the branches of the fenugreek add flavor to a dish, perhaps one should <span class="gemarra-regular">also separate</span> <span class="it-text">teruma</span> based <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the quantity of fenugreek <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks, </span>as well. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that there is no obligation to do so, and this is the novel element of his statement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>the following: This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to stalks </span>of grain; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">legumes, everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles </span>are not yet ready to be tithed and are therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>prohibited as <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce. </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who had bundles of fenugreek of untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may pound </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">and calculat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> how many seeds they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contain and separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> based <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but he does not separate </span>based <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks. What, is this not </span>referring to the normal case of <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., produce from which the regular <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, the initial portion taken from produce as the priests’ portion, must be separated?
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to a different case, that of first tithe that is still regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that must still be separated from it. First tithe is given to the Levites, who must separate ten percent as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe, to give to the priests. Before <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe is separated, the first tithe may not be eaten. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Abbahu </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Lakish said, as Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Lakish said: </span>It can occur that a Levite might take the <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe before </span>the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is separated, <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>the grain is still <span class="gemarra-regular">on the stalks. </span>The correct procedure is: After collecting the grain in a pile in the granary, one first separates <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, and only afterward separates first tithe to give to the Levites. 
If this order was not followed, and the first tithe was separated first while the grain was still attached to the stalks, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish maintains that the following <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Its name, </span>i.e., the fact that it has been designated first tithe, <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it </span>ready to be tithed and therefore prohibited as <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as pertains <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe </span>that must still be separated from it. This shows that there can be a separation of a type of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, specifically the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe, even before work on the produce has been completed, and this is the case to which the previously quoted mishna is referring.
The Gemara challenges this interpretation: If first tithe is considered untithed produce when it is named, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the act of <span class="gemarra-regular">pounding? Let </span>the Levite <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the priest: <span class="gemarra-regular">As they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gave to me </span>stalks of grain, or unprepared bundles, <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I am giving </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>in the same state. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a penalty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, the Levite should indeed be entitled to issue this claim; however, as he acted improperly by taking his tithe prematurely, the Sages decreed that he may not separate the priest’s portion in its current state, but must first improve it.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Levite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who was given stalks </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">as his tithes, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renders them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">a granary, </span>i.e., he must thresh and process them in the usual manner. Similarly, if he was given <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes, he renders them wine; </span>if he was given <span class="gemarra-regular">olives, he renders them oil; and </span>afterward he <span class="gemarra-regular">separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe for them and gives them to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a priest. For just as </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., standard <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not separated </span>from unprocessed produce, 

Daf 13b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but only from the granary and the winepress,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe is separated only from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the granary and the winepress. </span>
The Gemara asks: If the mishna is referring to produce from which <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span> has not been separated, it is appropriate to use the term: Calculates. However, according to the suggestion that it is referring to a first tithe, from which <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe must be separated, why does the mishna state: <span class="gemarra-regular">Calculates? </span>The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Measures</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The amount of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span> to be separated is calculated by estimation, as there is no fixed amount for this <span class="it-text">teruma</span> according to Torah law. With regard to the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> separated from first tithe, however, the Torah established the fixed amount of one-tenth, and one is required to measure precisely.
The Gemara explains: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>mishna? It is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Elazar ben Gimmel says: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> shall be reckoned to you as though it were the corn of the granary and as the fullness of the winepress” (Numbers 18:27). <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse speaks of two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terumot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. One </span>is <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe. Just as </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is separated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by estimatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and is not measured exactly, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is enough to separate it <span class="gemarra-regular">by thought</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the word “reckoned” implies that the mere intention to separate a particular portion serves to remove the rest of the produce from its untithed state, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> can also <span class="gemarra-regular">be separated by estimation and by thought.</span>
§ Since it was mentioned incidentally, the Gemara discusses <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe, in a case in which </span>the Levite <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the priest while the grain was still <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stalks, its name renders it untithed produce, </span>until he separates from it the <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Sinc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of </span>the first <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe was called </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon it, </span>the obligation of the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe takes effect as well.
The Gemara cites a similar <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe, in a case in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>the Levite <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the priest while the grain was still <span class="gemarra-regular">on the stalks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> before it was threshed and turned into a pile, the owner separated first tithe before <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. In that case, the separated tithe is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Although <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span> should have been separated from the produce first, and it should have included some of the produce taken as the first tithe, the Levite is nevertheless exempt from separating this <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. 
This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall set apart from it a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even a tenth part of the tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Numbers 18:26), which indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">A tenth part of the tithe, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe, <span class="gemarra-regular">I, </span>God, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you</span> that you must separate it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>you are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>obligated in both <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>if there is a source for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the Levite <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the priest, i.e., first tithe was separated after the grain had been threshed and the kernels of grain placed <span class="gemarra-regular">in a pile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>then it should <span class="gemarra-regular">also be exempt </span>from <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span>. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Pappa: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to your </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">From all that is given you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, you shall set apart that which is the Lord’s</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Numbers 18:29). This verse indicates that God’s <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, i.e., <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span>, must be taken from all the produce, including the tithe.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what did you see </span>that led you to require the separation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span> from first tithe that was taken from processed grain piled in the granary but not from first tithe that was taken from grain on stalks? Abaye answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This, </span>grain that has been threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <span class="gemarra-regular">has become grain, and that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>grain that remains on the stalk, <span class="gemarra-regular">has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">become</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grain. </span>Until the grain is threshed and assembled in a pile, the obligation to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> does not take effect, as it is not considered grain. When such unprocessed grain is designated first tithe, it ceases to be untithed produce and the opportunity to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from it has been missed. However, once the grain has been processed, and the obligation to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> has taken effect, it is as if the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is already mixed in, and the obligation to separate it cannot be overridden by the fact that this produce has been designated first tithe. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Ma</span><span class="it-text">’asrot</span> 4:5): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who peels </span>grains of <span class="gemarra-regular">barley </span>to eat them raw <span class="gemarra-regular">may peel them one </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat them </span>immediately without tithing them, as this is considered a casual manner of eating. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he peeled and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>several of them <span class="gemarra-regular">into his hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to separate tithes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: And a similar </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat. </span>Peeling grains of barley one by one is not considered threshing, and it is permitted; if a whole handful of grains are peeled together, this does constitute the prohibited labor of threshing. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But didn’t Rav’s wife </span><span class="gemarra-regular">peel for him </span>barley on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">by the cupful? And </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya’s wife </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">peel </span>barley <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">by the cupful. Rather, if </span>Rabbi Elazar’s comment <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>in this context, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was stated with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to the latter clause </span>of that same mishna (<span class="it-text">Ma’asrot</span> 4:5): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who husks kernels </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of wheat </span>by hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may blow </span>onto the chaff to disperse it <span class="gemarra-regular">a little at a time and eat </span>the kernels without separating tithes. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he blows </span>on the kernels <span class="gemarra-regular">and puts </span>a large amount of them <span class="gemarra-regular">into his lap, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to separate tithes from the food. It was with regard to this teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: And a similar </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Memel strongly objects to this: And</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna, one should conclude: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>if one peeled a handful of barley, it is considered prepared <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to tithes, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>it is not considered threshing <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But is there anything </span>that, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered the <span class="gemarra-regular">completion of the labor </span>and may be performed; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to tithes, it is</span> considered the <span class="gemarra-regular">completion of the labor? </span>Isn’t the prohibition against work on Shabbat far more stringent than tithes in all its details?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet, son of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Idi, strongly objects to this </span>claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is there <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span> example of a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in which tithes are treated more stringently than Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>there not the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">their granary for tithes, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ma’asrot</span> 1:5): <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the equivalent of <span class="gemarra-regular">their granary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the point at which the processing of various vegetable is completed so that they become obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tithes? </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">cucumbers and gourds, </span>they become obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">from when one trims </span>the thin hairs that cover them <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">misheyefaksu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>for those <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not trim, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from when he assembles them in a pile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we also learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ma’asrot</span> 1:6), <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to onions, </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from when one assembles </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them in a pile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Whereas with regard to Shabbat, </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">assembles </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">in a pile is exempt, </span>as this is not a prohibited labor on Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say? </span>Why is one exempt if he forms a pile on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">planned, </span>constructive<span class="gemarra-regular"> labo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> on Shabbat, the type of work that involves the creation of something new, and the formation of a pile is not considered that kind of labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>with regard to peeling barley, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> creative work. </span>Although collecting the peeled barley in one’s hand is considered the completion of the labor in respect to tithes, it is not prohibited labor on Shabbat.
Apropos husking kernels on Shabbat, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How may one hus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> grain on a Festival? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said in the name of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef: One </span>finger <span class="gemarra-regular">on another, </span>i.e., one may place the kernels between two fingers and rub. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Avya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said in the name of Rav Yosef: </span>One may even do so <span class="gemarra-regular">one on two, </span>i.e., between the thumb and two fingers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Since he alters </span>the manner in which he performs the activity, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may even </span>do so with <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>finger <span class="gemarra-regular">on all </span>the rest. 
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>may one <span class="gemarra-regular">blow </span>on the grain, to winnow it in a permitted manner on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ahava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One blows</span>

Daf 14a

<span class="gemarra-regular">from the joints of his fingers and above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he does not place the kernels mixed with chaff in his palm but on his fingers, which is an unusual way to hold them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They laughed at this </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he alters </span>his behavior from the usual method, doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">even with </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">entire hand </span>should be permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Elazar said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One may blow </span>while holding the grain <span class="gemarra-regular">with one hand </span>but not two, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he may even do so <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all his strength, </span>as this is not considered similar to a prohibited labor at all.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: Spices may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be pounded </span>on a Festival in a slightly unusual manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">with a wooden pestle, and salt </span>may be pounded only <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>an earthenware <span class="gemarra-regular">flask or with a wooden pot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ladle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in a manner very different from that of a weekday. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: Spices may be pounded in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">with a stone pestle, and </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">salt, </span>although it must be pounded in an irregular manner, a slight modification such as pounding it <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wooden pestle </span>is enough to render the act permitted.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, everyone, </span>both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that the pounding of <span class="gemarra-regular">salt requires </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a change; </span>it may not be performed in the regular weekday manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Ḥisda </span>disputed this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Everyone knows that <span class="gemarra-regular">all dishes require salt, </span>and therefore one should prepare salt the day before the Festival. Since he failed to do so, this task may be performed on the Festival only in an unusual manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But not all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dishes require spices, </span>and therefore it is possible that on the day prior to the Festival, one was not aware that he would require spices on the Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one said </span>a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">All spices lose their flavo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and cannot be prepared ahead of time, <span class="gemarra-regular">and salt does not lose its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flavor, </span>which means one could have prepared it the day before. Since he neglected to do so, he may prepare salt on the Festival only in an unusual manner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference between</span> these two reasons? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them is </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one knew </span>beforehand <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span> type of <span class="gemarra-regular">dish he wants to cook </span>on the Festival. Since he knew which spices he would require, he could have prepared them the day before, and which case spices are no different from salt, and one should be required to prepare them in an unusual manner. However, if the reason is that spices lose their flavor, the fact that he knew which dishes he planned to prepare is of no relevance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>there is a practical difference in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of saffron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whose flavor does not dissipate over the course of a single day. Consequently, one who knows what dish he will prepare on the Festival could have prepared the saffron the day before.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: All </span>foods <span class="gemarra-regular">that must be pounded </span>before being eaten may be <span class="gemarra-regular">pounded in their </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, and</span> this applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">salt. </span>The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> didn’t you say </span>that everyone agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">salt requires</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a chang</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in its manner of preparation? The Gemara answers: He <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not disagree in </span>the case of foods <span class="gemarra-regular">that are </span>regularly <span class="gemarra-regular">pounded. </span>They both maintain <span class="gemarra-regular">that they may be pounded in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, and salt </span>can be pounded together <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They disagreed only </span>about whether it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to pound </span>salt <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, as Beit Shammai say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Salt may be </span>pounded <span class="gemarra-regular">with a flask and with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wooden pot ladle for roasting, </span>i.e., in small quantities, as one does not require much salt for roasting meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be pounded in the large quantities required to salt meat <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a cooked <span class="gemarra-regular">pot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>It may be pounded <span class="gemarra-regular">by anything. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at this last statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">By anything</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Can this enter your mind? </span>How can Beit Hillel say that one may pound salt in any manner, when it has been established that everyone agrees that this may be performed only in an unusual manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: </span>Salt may be pounded <span class="gemarra-regular">for anything, </span>whether it is a small quantity for roasting or a large quantity for salting meat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Aḥa Bardela said to his son: When you pound </span>salt, <span class="gemarra-regular">tilt it </span>a little <span class="gemarra-regular">to the side and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">pound</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>so that it will at least be performed in a slightly different manner on a Festival. The Gemara similarly relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet heard the sound of a pestle </span>pounding salt on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>sound <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>coming <span class="gemarra-regular">from inside my house, </span>as I have instructed the members of my household not to do so. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps they tilted it </span>and pounded in a permitted manner? The Gemara answers: This could not have been the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">heard that it was a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clear sound, </span>unlike the one produced when a pestle is tilted. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps they were </span>pounding <span class="gemarra-regular">spices</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which may be pounded in the regular fashion on a Festival? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The sound </span>produced by pounding <span class="gemarra-regular">spices</span> is distinctive, <span class="gemarra-regular">like a bark, </span>which he would have recognized.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: On a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not prepare groats [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tisanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a dish comprised of grains of wheat crushed into quarters, which involves great effort, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor may one grind </span>grain <span class="gemarra-regular">with a mortar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and pestle. </span>The Gemara expresses puzzlement: These are <span class="gemarra-regular">tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> contradictory rulings. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> first stated that groats alone may not be prepared, as this involves hard work, implying that other items may be ground. He subsequently states that one may not grind with a mortar and pestle at all. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what he said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be amended to read as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not prepare groats? Because one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not grind with a mortar and pestle.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> simply <span class="gemarra-regular">say: One may not grind with a mortar and pestle, </span>from which it can be inferred that groats may not be prepared. The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he teaches </span>only: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not grind with a mortar and pestle, I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies only to a large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mortar and pestle, </span>whose use has the appearance of a weekday activity; <span class="gemarra-regular">but with a small mortar and pestle, </span>one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say it seems well, </span>and one may prepare even groats with this mortar and pestle. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>that groats may not be prepared in any manner.
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it taught </span>explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not grind with a large mortar and pestle, but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may grind with a small mortar and pestle? Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Also, when </span>the first <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a large mortar and pestle, </span>not a small one. In other words, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is stating two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, not one, as claimed previously. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> first rules that one may not prepare groats even with a small mortar and pestle, and he subsequently states that one may not use a large mortar and pestle for any purpose. 

Daf 14b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> do not contradict one another. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>ruling, which permits a small mortar and pestle, <span class="gemarra-regular">is for us,</span> the residents of Babylonia, who do not have servants, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is for them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, who have many servants. Since servants might treat the prohibition lightly, by using a large mortar and pestle and claiming they had used only a small one, they are prohibited from pounding in all cases.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> happened to come </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">to the house </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He brought to him porridge, </span>made from wheat groats, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not eat </span>it, out of concern that the wheat might have been pounded on the same day. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps they performed </span>the pounding <span class="gemarra-regular">with a small mortar and pestle, </span>in a permitted manner? The Gemara answers: This cannot be the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he observed that it was well ground, </span>which cannot be achieved by means of a small mortar and pestle. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prepared it the day before, </span>on the Festival eve? The Gemara answers: This cannot be the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he observed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that the husks </span>of the groats <span class="gemarra-regular">were bright, </span>an indication that they had been prepared recently. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead that he refrained from eating for another reason, because <span class="gemarra-regular">the house </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Shmuel is different, as </span>he had slaves, and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaves </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">lax </span>with regard to prohibitions. Therefore, Mar Shmuel ought to have prohibited all forms of grinding in his house, to ensure that no one grind anything in an inappropriate manner.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who selects legumes on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>by separating the edible and inedible portions, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: He may select food and eat </span>it immediately, while leaving the refuse. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: He may select </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, in his lap, with a tray, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or with a large vessel, but he may not </span>do so <span class="gemarra-regular">with a tablet, nor with a winnow, nor with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sieve, </span>as these vessels are specially designed for selecting, which gives his action the appearance of a weekday activity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel says: One may even wash </span>the legumes in water <span class="gemarra-regular">and skim off </span>the refuse floating on top.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>Under what circumstances did Beit Hillel permit the removal of the refuse in the weekday manner of selecting? In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the </span>quantity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">food is greater than the </span>quantity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">refuse. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>the quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">refuse is greater than the </span>quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">food</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must remove </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the food and leave the refuse. </span>
The Gemara asks: If the quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">refuse is greater than the </span>quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is there an opinion that permits </span>it? Since the smaller amount of food is nullified by the refuse, the entire mixture is considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> and may not be moved. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the removal of the refuse <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">greater in </span>terms of <span class="gemarra-regular">effort, and </span>yet it is <span class="gemarra-regular">smaller </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in size. </span>In other words, there is actually more food than refuse, but since greater effort is required to remove the refuse, it is preferable to remove the food. 
The mishna taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: One may even wash </span>the legumes in water <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> skim off </span>the refuse floating on top. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="it-text">Beitza</span> 1): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: This was the custom of the house of Rabban Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that they would bring a bucket full with lentils and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pour water in it, and then </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>would sink <span class="gemarra-regular">down and the refuse </span>would float <span class="gemarra-regular">up, </span>which spared them from having to separate the lentils from the refuse manually.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t the opposite taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that the food rose to the top while the refuse sunk below? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which says the refuse sinks down, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>refuse in the form of <span class="gemarra-regular">earth, </span>which sinks below the lentils; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where it is stated that the refuse rises, speaks <span class="gemarra-regular">of straw, </span>which floats on water.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may send</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of prepared food <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, </span>but not any other gifts. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: One may </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">send </span>gifts of <span class="gemarra-regular">domesticated animals, undomesticated animals, and fowl, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whether alive or slaughtered. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may send wines, oils, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>vessels of <span class="gemarra-regular">flour, and </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">legumes, but not grain, </span>which is unfit for use, as one may not grind it on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon permits </span>sending gifts even in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it can be made into porridge without being ground.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yeḥiel teaches: And </span>one may send these items <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he does not do it by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">convo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of people, as they would look as though they were transporting merchandise to the marketplace. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A convoy </span>consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">no less than three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> if there are fewer than three, it is not called a convoy and is permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma: </span>In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">three people and three </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">types </span>of food, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this considered a convoy, or does the fact that there are three different types of food mean that each of them is considered a separate item? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved, as no answer was found. 
The mishna taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon permits</span> the sending <span class="gemarra-regular">of grain. It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon permits </span>the sending <span class="gemarra-regular">of grain, for example</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Wheat to prepare from it </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ludiyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of cookie; <span class="gemarra-regular">barley to place before his animal; </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">lentils to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prepare from them </span><span class="gemarra-italic">resisin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a dish made from crushed lentils.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may send </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clothes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">sewn or whether they are unsewn, and even if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they contain diverse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a prohibited mixture of wool and linen [<span class="it-text">sha’atnez</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one may do so only if <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>serve <span class="gemarra-regular">the purposes of the Festival. However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may not </span>send <span class="gemarra-regular">a spiked sandal, </span>which has nails fixed to it, as the Sages decreed that one may not wear a sandal of this kind on a Shabbat or Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor an unsewn shoe, </span>which is not suitable for a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even </span>send <span class="gemarra-regular">a white shoe, </span>which people do not usually wear, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires an artisan </span>to paint it black. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the </span>general <span class="gemarra-regular">principle: </span>Anything <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may use on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, one may send it.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>it is permitted to send <span class="gemarra-regular">sewn </span>clothes, as they are <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable for wearing. </span>With regard to clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are not sewn as well, they are </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for covering </span>oneself. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of clothes than contain <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds, for what </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">are they suited? </span>Since these clothes may not be used on the Festival, why is it permitted to send them?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that clothes of diverse kinds <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">suited for one to place underneath himself, but isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neither shall there come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon you </span>a garment of diverse kinds” (Leviticus 19:19)? This verse teaches that one may not wear this garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>by Torah law <span class="gemarra-regular">you may spread it beneath you. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">However, the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lest a thread [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wind itself around his flesh. </span>This shows that the Sages prohibited even spreading underneath oneself a cloth that contains a mixture of wool and linen. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>the allowance of cloth of diverse kinds is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there is something separating between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>i.e., one may place a garment of diverse kinds beneath another object, <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pazi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei ben Shaul said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said, in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of the sacred congregation in Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Even </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten mattresses </span>placed <span class="gemarra-regular">one on top </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the other and </span>a cloth of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds underneath </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, it is prohibited to sleep on them, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neither shall there come upon you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 19:19).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a curtain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vilon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of diverse kinds, which may be hung up, as it is not an item of clothing. The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Ulla say: For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a curtain is ritually impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that it can contract the impurity of a vessel despite the fact that it is not directly used by people? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because the attendant warms himself with it. </span>Since attendants use curtains as makeshift blankets when they are cold, a curtain may not be made from a mixture of wool and linen. 

Daf 15a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to hard</span> clothes, upon which it is permitted to sit even if they are a mixture of wool and linen. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this hard felt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">namta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> material produced in the town <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neresh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is permitted </span>to sit or recline on it, and one need not be concerned about the fact that it is a mixture of wool and linen. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">felt socks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ardalayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is no </span>prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds regarding them, </span>as they are hard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: These bundles for coins, </span>comprised of hard fabric or felt, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to them. </span>However, with regard to pouches <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>holding <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds, there is </span>a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them, </span>as they are larger and softer than both felt socks and hard bundles for coins. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Both this and that have no </span>prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to them because </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of keeping warm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Even if these objects are placed close to one’s skin, this is not the usual way of wearing clothes and warming oneself, and therefore they are permitted.
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one may not </span>send <span class="gemarra-regular">a spiked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span>on a Festival. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">A spiked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sandal, what is the reason </span>that it may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be worn? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to an incident </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that occurred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A great tragedy resulted when people wore spiked sandals on Shabbat, which led the Sages to decree that these sandals may not be worn on a Shabbat or Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a spiked sandal, it is prohibited to wear </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it is permitted to move it. </span>He clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is prohibited to wear </span>a spiked sandal, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">incident that occurred. And it is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to move it, from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may not send. For if it enters your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">to move </span>a spiked sandal, <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>consider: If <span class="gemarra-regular">it were prohibited to move it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>is the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">required </span>to state that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may send</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it? </span>Rather, it must certainly be permitted to move a spiked sandal inside the house, despite the fact that one may not wear it.
The mishna further teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor </span>may one send <span class="gemarra-regular">an unsewn shoe </span>on a Festival. The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as these shoes are unfit for wearing. The Gemara answers: This statement <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary </span>only to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that although </span>the shoe <span class="gemarra-regular">is attached with pins </span>and can be worn, it may not be sent on a Festival. Since it not properly sewn, it is not usually worn. 
The mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not even </span>send <span class="gemarra-regular">a white shoe. It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda permits </span>the sending <span class="gemarra-regular">of a black </span>shoe <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibits </span>the sending <span class="gemarra-regular">of a white one because </span>a white one <span class="gemarra-regular">requires a lump of chal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> to color it properly. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei prohibits </span>the sending <span class="gemarra-regular">of a black </span>shoe <span class="gemarra-regular">because one needs to polish it. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they do not disagree </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage </span>ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the custom <span class="gemarra-regular">of his locale, and </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage </span>ruled differently, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the custom of <span class="gemarra-regular">his locale. In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the place of </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, the leather was made so that the side of the hide facing the <span class="gemarra-regular">flesh </span>is on the <span class="gemarra-regular">underneath, </span>facing the inside of the shoe, and therefore it does not require polishing; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the place of </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei, the leather was made so that side of the hide facing the <span class="gemarra-regular">flesh </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">above, </span>facing the outside of the shoe. That side is often cracked and uneven and requires smoothing and polishing. 
§ The mishna taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the </span>general <span class="gemarra-regular">principle: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>article <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">use on a Festival, </span>one may send it. The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet permitted the Sages to send phylacteries on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival. Abaye said to him: But didn’t we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>article <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may use on a Festival, one may send it? </span>Phylacteries are not worn on Festivals. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any</span> article <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may use on a weekday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may send it on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries, since </span>this topic <span class="gemarra-regular">has come before us </span>in the previous discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>a novel <span class="gemarra-regular">matter about it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If someone <span class="gemarra-regular">was coming on the road </span>on the eve of a Shabbat or Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he had <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on his head, </span>as the practice then was to don phylacteries the entire day, but not at night, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sun set </span>before <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>arrived at his destination, signaling the beginning of the Shabbat or Festival, when phylacteries may not be worn or even moved, <span class="gemarra-regular">he places his hand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> to cover them so that people will not see them <span class="gemarra-regular">until he reaches his house, </span>at which point he removes them. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he was sitting in the study</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with phylacteries on his head, and the day </span>of Shabbat or the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">was sanctified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was unprepared, <span class="gemarra-regular">he places his hand upon them until </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he reaches his house.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Ika, raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection </span>from the following teaching: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was coming </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the road with phylacteries on his head, and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day was sanctified </span>before <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>arrived at his destination, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">places his hand upon them until he reaches the house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nearest the wall, </span>where he removes them and leaves them there. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he was sitting in the study hall, </span>outside the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the day was sanctified, for </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was unprepared, <span class="gemarra-regular">he places his hand upon them until he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reaches a house that is near the study hall, </span>where there are people who can guard the phylacteries. This shows that one may not bring phylacteries all the way to his house, but only to the nearest place within the city boundary.
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which teaches that one places the phylacteries in the house nearest the wall, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the phylacteries can be <span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarded </span>there, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that he may bring them all the way to his house, deals with a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where they are not safeguarded </span>in the nearest house.
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the phylacteries are <span class="gemarra-regular">not safeguarded, why </span>discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>the case of phylacteries that were <span class="gemarra-regular">on his head? Even </span>if one was not donning them but found them <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the ground, </span>he should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be required to don them and bring them to the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">for didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> 95a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who finds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">phylacterie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> lying in a field outside of the city on Shabbat should don them and <span class="gemarra-regular">bring them into </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">one pair at a time? </span>
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, where it was taught that one need not don the phylacteries if they were not already on his head, is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where they are safeguarded from thieves and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">from dogs. That </span>mishna, which stated that even if one found them on the ground, he must put them on and bring them into the city, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they are safeguarded from dogs but are not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">safeguarded from thieves.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the novel element of the mishna’s ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: Since most thieves [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">listim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are Jews, who would not treat </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">with contempt,</span> one should not be allowed to carry them because there is no danger that they will be desecrated if they are left in their place, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> takes the minority of cases into account. It is therefore appropriate to don the phylacteries and bring them into the city. 


Daf 15b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival that occurs </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat eve, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may not cook on the Festival with the initial </span>intent to cook <span class="gemarra-regular">for Shabbat. However, he may cook </span>on that day <span class="gemarra-regular">for the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he left </span><span class="gemarra-regular">over </span>any food, <span class="gemarra-regular">he left </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">over for Shabbat. </span>The early Sages also instituted an ordinance: The joining of cooked foods [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">tavshilin</span>], which the mishna explains. <span class="gemarra-regular">One may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prepare a cooked dish </span>designated for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve and rely on it </span>to cook on the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">for Shabbat.</span>
The <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagreed with regard to the details of this ordinance: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>For the purpose of the joining of cooked foods one must prepare <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cooked dishes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Beit Hillel say: One dish </span>is sufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">agree with regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fish and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">egg that is </span>fried <span class="gemarra-regular">on i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">two dishes </span>for this purpose. 
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one ate </span>the food prepared before the Festival as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and none of it remained for Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if it was lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may not </span>rely <span class="gemarra-regular">on it </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cook with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> initial </span>intent to cook for Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he left any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> part of </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on it </span>to cook <span class="gemarra-regular">for Shabbat. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? What is the source of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the joining of cooked foods and of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one who failed to prepare such an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may not cook on a Festival for Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said </span>that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: “Remember the Shabbat day, to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">keep it holy” </span>(Exodus 20:8); from which he infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Remember</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>and safeguard it <span class="gemarra-regular">from another </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> make it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forgotten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When a Festival occurs on Friday, preoccupation with the Festival and the preparation and enjoyment of its meals could lead one to overlook Shabbat. Therefore, the Sages instituted an ordinance to ensure that Shabbat will be remembered even then.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>that the Sages instituted this ordinance in particular to ensure that Shabbat would not be overlooked? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The Sages did so in deference to Shabbat, and they instituted an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">so that one will select a choice</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> portion for Shabbat and a choice portion for the Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If one fails to prepare a dish specifically for Shabbat before the Festival, it could lead to failure to show the appropriate deference to Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi stated </span>a different reason: The Sages did so in deference to the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may not bake on a Festival for Shabbat </span>unless he began to bake the day before; <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>one may not bake <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> weekday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may prepare</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a cooked dish on a Festival eve and rely on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>to cook <span class="gemarra-regular">for Shabbat. Granted, according to Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who said </span>that the reason for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will say: One may not bake on a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival for Shabbat; that is </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival eve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, yes, </span>one may prepare the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, but <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival</span> itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>one may not do so, as it is a reminder that in principle one may not cook on a Festival for Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to Rava, </span>who stated that the reason for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is to ensure that one selects choice portions for both the Festival and Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does the mishna discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>preparation <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eve? Even </span>were one to prepare a dish for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival as well, </span>it would guarantee that he accord the appropriate deference to Shabbat. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, it is indeed so; </span>that objective could have been achieved even on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the Sages issued <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> must be prepared on the Festival eve <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one be negligent </span>and fail to prepare one entirely.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cites </span>the proof for <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">tavshilin</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>the following verse: “Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Shabbat to the Lord. <span class="gemarra-regular">Bake that which you will bak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cook that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which you will cook, </span>and all that remains put aside to be kept for you until the morning” (Exodus 16:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">From here Rabbi Eliezer said: One may bake </span>on a Festival for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>by relying <span class="gemarra-regular">on that which was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">baked </span>for Shabbat the day before, and adding to it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may cook only </span>by relying <span class="gemarra-regular">on that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked. From this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages established </span>an allusion <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">joining of cooked foods from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who was sitting and lecturing about the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival throughout the entire </span>Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">day. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">the first group</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> left </span>in the middle of his lecture, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: These</span> must be <span class="gemarra-regular">owners of extremely large jugs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pittasin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who apparently have huge containers of wine awaiting them as well as a comparable amount of food, and they have left the house of study out of a craving for their food. After a while <span class="gemarra-regular">a second group </span>departed. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: These are owners of barrels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are smaller than <span class="it-text">pittasin</span>. Later <span class="gemarra-regular">a third group </span>took its leave, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: These are owners of jugs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even smaller than barrels.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A fourth group</span> left, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: These are owners of jars [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">laginin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are smaller than jugs. Upon the departure of <span class="gemarra-regular">a fifth group, he said: These are owners of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cups</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are smaller still. When <span class="gemarra-regular">a sixth group </span><span class="gemarra-regular">began to leave, he </span>became upset that the house of study was being left almost completely empty and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: These </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are owners of a curse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> i.e., they obviously do not have anything at home, so why are they leaving?
<span class="gemarra-regular">He cast his eyes upon the students </span>remaining in the house of study. Immediately, <span class="gemarra-regular">their faces began to chang</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> color out of shame, as they feared he was referring to them and that perhaps they should have departed along with the others instead of staying. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: My</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sons, I did not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">about you but about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those who left, because they abandon </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">eternal life </span>of Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">and engage in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">temporary life </span>of eating. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">At the time of </span>the remaining students’ <span class="gemarra-regular">departure </span>at the conclusion of Rabbi Eliezer’s lecture, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Go your way, eat the fat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and drink the sweet, and send portions to him for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">our Lord; and do not be grieved, for the joy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Lord is your strength” </span>(Nehemiah 8:10).
The Gemara clarifies this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>above: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because they abandon eternal life and engage in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> temporary life. </span>The Gemara wonders at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the joy of the Festival </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva </span>and therefore part of eternal life? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>Physical <span class="gemarra-regular">joy on a Festival is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">optional.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: A person has no </span>way of fulfilling the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival </span>correctly <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from either eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and drinking, </span>thereby fulfilling the mitzva of joy in a completely physical manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">or sitting and studying </span>Torah, thereby emphasizing only the spiritual; and those who did not engage in Torah study to the fullest extent acted inappropriately. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>There is no need for such a dichotomy; rather, simply <span class="gemarra-regular">divide it: Half to God, </span>Torah study, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half to yourselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> engaging in eating, drinking, and other pleasurable activities.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And both of them derived </span>their opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">from one verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the two of them addressed the same apparent contradiction between two verses, resolving it in different ways. <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: </span>“It shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">a solemn assembly for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord, your God” </span>(Deuteronomy 16:8), indicating a Festival dedicated to the service of God, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one verse states: “It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be a solemn assembly for you” </span>(Numbers 29:35), indicating a celebratory assembly for the Jewish people. <span class="gemarra-regular">How is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>to be reconciled? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer holds </span>that the two verses should be understood as offering a choice: The day is to be <span class="gemarra-regular">either entirely for God, </span>in accordance with the one verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">or entirely for you, </span>as per the other verse; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yehoshua holds </span>that it is possible to fulfill both verses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Split </span>the day into two, <span class="gemarra-regular">half of it for God and half of it for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you. </span>
§ Since the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mentions the verse from Nehemiah, the Gemara poses the following question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: “Send portions <span class="gemarra-regular">to him for whom nothing is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prepared” </span>(Nehemiah 8:10)?<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥisda said: </span>Send to one who does not have food of his own prepared for Shabbat that follows the Festival because <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not prepare a joining of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cooked foods </span>and must therefore rely on others. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say</span> that he said the following: It is necessary to provide food for <span class="gemarra-regular">one who did not have </span>an opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prepare a joining of cooked foods </span>on the eve of the Festival; <span class="gemarra-regular">but one who had </span>an opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prepare a joining of cooked foods and did not prepare </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is negligent, </span>and there is no obligation to care for him.
The Gemara poses another question with regard to the same verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“F</span><span class="gemarra-regular">or the joy of the Lord is your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strength”? Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon: The Holy One, Blessed be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He, said to the Jewish people: My children, borrow on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> My </span>account, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sanctify the sanctity of the day </span>of Shabbat and the Festivals with wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and trust in Me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and I will repa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> this debt.
Apropos the statement attributed to Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, the Gemara cites another statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">anan said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon: One who wants his properties to be preserved </span>and protected from ruin should <span class="gemarra-regular">plant an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ede</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> tree <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “The Lord on high </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is mighty [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">adir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Psalms 93:4). Due to the similarity of the words <span class="it-text">eder</span> and <span class="it-text">adir</span>, this is understood to mean that the <span class="it-text">eder</span> tree bestows permanence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eder</span> tree will preserve one’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>implied by <span class="gemarra-regular">its name, as people say: What is </span>alluded to in the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Its name hints <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">endures for many generations [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">darei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A field that contains an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eder</span> tree <span class="gemarra-regular">will be neither stolen nor forcibly removed </span>from one’s possession, as the <span class="it-text">eder</span> serves as a clear indication of its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its fruit is preserved, </span>as the unique odor of the <span class="it-text">eder</span> sap wards off insects. 
§ The Gemara returns to the previous issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Taḥlifa, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brother </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravnai Ḥoza’a, taught: </span>

Daf 16a

<span class="gemarra-regular">A person’s entire livelihood is allocated to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>during the period <span class="gemarra-regular">from Rosh HaShana to Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>During that time, as each individual is judged, it is decreed exactly how much money he will earn for all his expenditures of the coming year, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for expenditures for</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and expenditures for Festivals, and expenditures for </span>the school fees of <span class="gemarra-regular">his sons’ </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study. </span>In these areas, no exact amount is determined at the beginning of the year; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he reduced </span>the amount he spends for these purposes, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>income <span class="gemarra-regular">is reduced </span>and he earns that much less money in that year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he increased</span> his expenditures in these areas, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>income <span class="gemarra-regular">is increased </span>to ensure that he can cover the expense. Therefore, one may borrow for these purposes, since he is guaranteed to have enough income to cover whatever he spends for them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said: What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>from which this dictum is derived? The source is: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Blow the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shofar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the New Moon, at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concealed </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">for our Festival day” </span>(Psalms 81:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">On </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which Festival is the new moon concealed? </span>You <span class="gemarra-regular">must say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Rosh HaShana, </span>which occurs on the first of the month, when the moon is not yet visible, while the moon is visible during the other Festivals, which occur in the middle of the month. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>in the next verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For it is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statute [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥok</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for Israel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a judgment of the God</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Jacob” </span>(Psalms 81:5).
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>may it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred that this </span>word <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">statute [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥok</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” is a term </span>relating <span class="gemarra-regular">to food? As it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “And they ate their allotment [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥukkam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pharaoh gave them” </span>(Genesis 47:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: </span>One can learn that <span class="it-text">ḥok</span> is referring to food <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Feed me with my allotted [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥukki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] bread” </span>(Proverbs 30:8).
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai the Elde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">all his days he would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat in honor of Shabbat. </span>How so? If <span class="gemarra-regular">he found</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a choice animal, he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say: This is for Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">found another one choicer than it, he</span> would <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside the second </span>for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first. </span>He would eat the first to leave the better-quality animal for Shabbat, which continually rendered his eating an act of honoring Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, Hillel the Elder had a different trait, that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all his actions, </span>including those on a weekday, <span class="gemarra-regular">were for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sake of Heaven, as it is stated: “Blessed be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord, day by day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> He bears our burden, our God who is our salvation; Selah” (Psalms 68:20), meaning that God gives a blessing for each and every day. <span class="gemarra-regular">That is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in more general terms: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: From the first </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the week, </span>Sunday, start preparing already <span class="gemarra-regular">for your Shabbat. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beit Hillel say: “Blessed be the Lord, day by day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.”</span>
§ Apropos the statements about honoring Shabbat, the Gemara cites another statement on the same topic. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: One who gives </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a gift to his friend need not inform him </span>that he has given it to him, and he need not concern himself that the recipient might not realize who gave it to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And Moses did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not know that the skin of his face was radiant” </span>(Exodus 34:29); Moses received this gift unawares. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this. Isn’t it written: “Nevertheless, you must keep My <span class="it-text">Shabbatot</span>, for this is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, <span class="gemarra-regular">that you may know that I am the Lord Who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctifies you” </span>(Exodus 31:13), which the Sages expounded as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Moses, I have a good gif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in My treasury, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its name is Shabbat, and I wish to give it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Jewish people. Go and inform them </span>of this intention of Mine. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from here Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: One who gives </span>a gift of <span class="gemarra-regular">a piece of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread to a child must inform his mother </span>of his actions, so that the child’s parents will be aware of the giver’s fond feelings for them, thereby enhancing friendly relations and companionship among Jews. This appears to be in direct contradiction to Rabbi Ḥama’s statement. 
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, where one need not inform the recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">referring to a gift that is likely to be revealed, </span>such as Moses’ shining face, which everyone would point out to him; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where one must inform the recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">is referring to a gift that is not likely </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to be revealed </span>in the natural course of events. The Gemara challenges: Isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat also a gift that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">likely to be revealed, </span>as the Jews would eventually be instructed with regard to the time and nature of Shabbat? The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">its reward is not likely to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be revealed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, God told Moses to inform the Jews of the gift of Shabbat and its reward.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>earlier that <span class="gemarra-regular">from here Rabban Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Gamliel said: One who gives a piece of bread </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a child must inform his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does he do to him; </span>how does he inform the child’s mother? <span class="gemarra-regular">He rubs oil on him and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">paints his eyes blue, </span>so that when the child arrives home his mother will ask him who did this to him and he will reply that it was a person who also gave him a piece of bread. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And nowadays, when we are concerned about witchcraft, </span>i.e., that painting the child’s eyes might have been performed as an act of sorcery, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>should one do? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: He rubs on </span>the child a little <span class="gemarra-regular">of that same type </span>of food that he put on the bread, such as butter or cheese, and this will cause the child’s mother to notice that he received a present.
The Gemara cites a further statement with regard to the gift of Shabbat to the Jewish people. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Yoḥai: All </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot that the Holy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One, Blessed be He, gave to the Jewish people, He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gave to them in public [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parhesya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except for Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which he gave to them in private. As it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “It is a sign between Me and the children </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Israel forever” </span>(Exodus 31:17), meaning that in a sense, it is a secret between God and the Jewish people. 
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that it was given in secret so that not everyone knew about it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the gentiles should not be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punished for </span>not wanting to accept <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> they are liable to receive punishment for refusing to accept the other mitzvot of the Torah. The Gemara answers: The Holy One, Blessed be He, <span class="gemarra-regular">did inform them </span>of the concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>but He <span class="gemarra-regular">did not inform them </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the reward </span>for the fulfillment of the mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">He also informed </span>the gentiles of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reward, </span>but about the idea of the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional sou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> given to each person on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">He did not inform them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, gives a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an additional soul on Shabbat eve, and at the conclusion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Shabbat removes it from him, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “He ceased from work and was refreshed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vayinafash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 31:17). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish expounds the verse as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he ceased from work, </span>and now Shabbat has concluded and his additional soul is removed from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">woe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>for the additional <span class="gemarra-regular">soul [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nefesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lost.</span>
It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may prepare a cooked dish on a Festival eve </span>and rely on it for Shabbat for the joining of cooked foods. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: They taught </span>that the joining of cooked foods allows one to cook on a Festival for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when it is made from <span class="gemarra-regular">a cooked dish; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>if it is composed of <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>this is not sufficient. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">bread that </span>makes it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>fit for this purpose? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require something that accompanies </span>bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bread does not accompany </span>itself, the following difficulty arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Porridge also does not accompany </span>bread, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zeir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Those foolish Babylonians eat bread with bread, </span>referring to their custom of eating bread with porridge. This shows that porridge is no better accompaniment to bread than bread itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Neḥumi bar Zekharya said in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of Abaye: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> porridge. Rather, </span>one must say as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">We require something</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is not routine, </span>so that it will be clear that one is setting it aside for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bread is routine, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">porridge is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not routine. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of this discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: They taught </span>that a joining of cooked foods allows one to cook on a Festival for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when it is made from <span class="gemarra-regular">a cooked dish; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>if it is composed of <span class="gemarra-regular">bread, no, </span>that is not sufficient. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that we require something that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not routine, and bread is routine, </span>the following difficulty arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t porridge not </span>particularly <span class="gemarra-regular">routine? And </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neḥumi bar Zekharya said in the name of Abaye: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with porridge. Rather, </span>one should say as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">We require something that accompanies </span>bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bread does not accompany </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and porridge, too, does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not accompany </span>bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Zeira said: Those foolish Babylonians</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat bread with bread, </span>from which it is clear that like bread, porridge does not accompany bread and consequently cannot constitute an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">lentils that </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">at the bottom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a po</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on the eve of a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may rely on them for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">joining of cooked foods</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although they were not prepared with this purpose in mind, they are nevertheless considered a cooked dish. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> applies only </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an olive-bulk </span>of lentils in total. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fat </span>of meat and the like <span class="gemarra-regular">that is on a knife, one may scrape it </span>off the knife <span class="gemarra-regular">and rely on it for the joining of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cooked foods; and this applies only </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> olive-bulk </span>of fat in total.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Small salted fis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> that a gentile then cooked <span class="gemarra-regular">are not considered the cooked food </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> because cooking does not prepare them to be food any more than they already were, as they can be eaten in their salted state. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: And</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">if a gentile roasted them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a Jew may <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on them for the joining of cooked foods, </span>as they are not considered the cooked food of a gentile and are indeed already edible. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile </span><span class="gemarra-regular">made them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">fish fried with oil and flour [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kasa</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">deharsena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is prohibited </span>to eat them. In this case they are considered the cooked food of a gentile, since his actions have made them into noteworthy food.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is obvious </span>that this is the case; it need not be taught. The Gemara answers: The justification for teaching it is <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that

Daf 16b

the <span class="gemarra-regular">fish fat, </span>which one is permitted to eat even if cooked by gentiles, is the <span class="gemarra-regular">essential element. </span>Therefore, he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the flour </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">essential </span><span class="gemarra-regular">element, </span>and the gentile has created a new and significant dish, which is consequently prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A joining of cooked foods requires an olive-bulk </span>of food. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Is it enough to have <span class="gemarra-regular">one olive-bulk for all of </span>the household members who are relying on this <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps</span> must there be a separate <span class="gemarra-regular">olive-bulk for each and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every one </span>in the household? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: A joining of cooked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> foods requires an olive-bulk, whether </span>it is cooked <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a single </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">or for one hundred </span>people.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ate </span>the joining of cooked foods that he prepared, <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it was lost, he may not </span>rely <span class="gemarra-regular">on it</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">cook with the initial </span>intent to cook for Shabbat; but if <span class="gemarra-regular">he left any part of </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on it </span>to cook <span class="gemarra-regular">for Shabbat. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any part of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it? Doesn’t it </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">although </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is not an olive-bulk? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the phrase: Any part of it, means <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk </span>left.
The Gemara attempts to bring another proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked dish </span>that is required for a joining of cooked foods may <span class="gemarra-regular">be roasted, or even pickled, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">well-boiled, or boiled </span>in the regular manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>may even be <span class="gemarra-regular">Spanish soft </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sea fish [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">koleyas</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’ispenin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon which one poured </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hot </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of the Festival, </span>rendering it cooked. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">its beginning and end, </span>meaning its required size <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span> and after it has been reduced by being partially lost or partially eaten, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">measure. What, is it not </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">measure at all, </span>not even a minimum one? The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not have a maximum measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but it does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have a minimum measure, </span>namely an olive-bulk.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: A joining </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of cooked foods </span><span class="gemarra-regular">requires</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that one must be aware of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for it to be effective. The Gemara comments: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge of the one who prepares </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>; the question is: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">require </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge of the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for whom </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is prepared</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or do we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not require </span>it?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a proof from the following testimonies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s fathe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> would <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tiberias</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">announce: </span>Anyone <span class="gemarra-regular">who did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not prepare a joining of cooked foods </span>for himself should <span class="gemarra-regular">come and rely on mine. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And up </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to how much </span>may one rely on it, i.e., how far may one be from such an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and still rely upon it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Neḥumi bar Zekharya said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Abaye: </span>One may be <span class="gemarra-regular">as far </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Shabbat limit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara relates: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the blind person who would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">present </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mishnayot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Mar Shmuel, </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">observed that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was sad. </span>Mar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Why are you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sad? He said to him: </span>Because <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not prepare </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a joining of cooked foods </span>before the Festival. Mar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Then <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on mine. In the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">year, he </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">observed that he was sad. He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Why are you sad? He said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: </span>Because <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not prepare a joining of cooked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foods. </span>Mar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">you are </span>consistently <span class="gemarra-regular">negligen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in this regard. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., anyone else but you, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span> to rely on my <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> if they forgot to prepare one, but <span class="gemarra-regular">for you </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to do so, as I did not intend to include such negligent people as yourself in my <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival occurs on Shabbat eve, one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prepare an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> on that day, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither a joining of</span> Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">teḥumin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] nor a joining of courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥatzerot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>for Shabbat. If one did not prepare these before the Festival, he may not do so on the Festival itself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>On a Festival that occurs on a Friday, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may prepare </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">a joining of courtyards, but not </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a joining of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries. </span>His reasoning is as follows: There is a distinction between the two types of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">because you may prohibit him from a matter that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to him, </span>e.g., venturing beyond the Shabbat limit, which is prohibited on a Festival as well as Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">but you may not prohibit him from a matter that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted to him, </span>e.g., carrying from one domain to another, which is permitted on a Festival. Therefore, on a Festival, one may not prepare a joining of Shabbat boundaries in order to render it permitted to venture beyond the boundary on the Shabbat following the Festival. However, one may prepare a joining of courtyards on the Festival in order to render it permitted to carry from one domain to another on the Shabbat following the Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed as to the conclusive ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who said that it is prohibited to prepare both types of <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, and it is permitted to prepare a joining of courtyards on a Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Is stating that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">a leniency or a stringency? </span>The Gemara wonders at this query: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he stated it as a leniency. </span>The Gemara explains: The question was asked <span class="gemarra-regular">because Rabbi Elazar sent </span>a message from Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Diaspora: </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you teach </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">permits</span> one to prepare a joining of courtyards on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis prohibit </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the opinions should be reversed, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis permit </span>it. Therefore, the question arose: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the conclusive ruling for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it lenient or stringent?
The Gemara attempts to cite a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Taḥlifa bar Avdim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performed an action in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the opinion of Shmuel, </span>who ruled that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav said </span>in anger about this: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling of this young Torah scholar is </span>bringing about <span class="gemarra-regular">corruption</span> of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The Gemara analyzes this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said it as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a leniency, this </span>explains <span class="gemarra-regular">the corruption </span>of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> involved, as Rav was angered by a young scholar who relied on his own judgment to issue a lenient ruling on a disputed issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say </span>that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi meant it <span class="gemarra-regular">as a stringency, what corruption </span>of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span>in the young scholar’s ruling? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it corrupts </span>the behavior of <span class="gemarra-regular">the masses, </span>as, if they refrain from preparing a joining of courtyards on the Festival although it is permitted to do so, they might mistakenly carry from one domain to another on Shabbat, 

Daf 17a

<span class="gemarra-regular">this is the corruption </span>that might result from a ruling that renders it prohibited to prepare an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> the day before. Therefore, this cannot serve as proof of the conclusive ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">to prohibi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> one from preparing either type of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. One may not prepare an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> either for courtyards or for boundaries, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with Rabbi Elazar’s version of the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival that occurs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, Beit Shammai say: One must recite </span>an <span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">prayer </span>that includes <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>blessings, inserting two additional blessings between the standard opening three and concluding three.

Rav Huna said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">that pair </span>of scholars; rather, it is in accordance with the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, that in the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers one recites the usual seven blessings and recites a passage pertaining to the event of the day during the blessing of the Temple service. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>forgot to place an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> before a Festival occurring on Thursday and Friday in the Diaspora, he may act as follows: He may <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>the first <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival day for the next, </span>i.e., on the first Festival day for the second Festival day kept in the Diaspora, based on a doubt as to which day is the real day of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stipulat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> as follows: If today is in fact the Festival, then tomorrow is a weekday, on which I may walk as far as I wish in all directions; and if today is a weekday and tomorrow is the Festival, I hereby place an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the joining of Shabbat boundaries for tomorrow. On the following day he makes a similar stipulation with the same <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, so that he will have an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: A person may place </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of cooked foods on </span>the first <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival day </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the next </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">and stipulate </span>as follows: If today is a weekday and tomorrow is the Festival, this is my joining of cooked foods, so that I may rely on it to cook tomorrow for Shabbat; and if today is in fact the Festival and tomorrow is a weekday, I may cook tomorrow as on a regular weekday. 
The Gemara comments: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>would he permit one to act in this manner concerning an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cooked foods. </span>On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cooked foods </span>spoke only with regard to the joining of cooked foods; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>as for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this difference? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit <span class="gemarra-regular">the acquisition of residence on</span> a day of <span class="gemarra-regular">rest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even in a case of uncertainty. However, with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the joining of cooked foods, since it is merely symbolic, it is permitted for the sake of the honor of Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not bake</span> bread <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival day for the next, </span>i.e., on the first Festival day for the second Festival day kept in the Diaspora. Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">actually, they said </span>the following established <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A woman may fill an entire pot </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">meat </span>to cook on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">although she requires </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only one piece </span>for that day, and all the remainder will be for the following day. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a baker may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fill </span>an entire <span class="gemarra-regular">barre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with water </span>in order to heat it up <span class="gemarra-regular">although he requires only a jug </span>of hot water. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to baking, he may bake onl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that which he requires </span>for that day.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Elazar says: A woman may fill the entire ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> with <span class="gemarra-regular">bread, </span>although she does not intend to use it all on that day, <span class="gemarra-regular">because bread bakes wel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the oven is full. </span>A full oven has less empty space and is therefore hotter; consequently, filling the oven with bread serves not only to provide bread for the next day but also to improve the bread to be eaten that same day. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who did not prepare </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of cooked foods, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">he prohibited </span>from cooking for Shabbat and <span class="gemarra-regular">his flour is </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>meaning that none of his food may be prepared for Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited </span>from performing this type of labor, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his flour is not prohibited.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">practical </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>that emerges from this question? The Gemara explains: There is a difference with respect to whether or not he must <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer</span> ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">his flour to others. If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited and his flour is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must transfe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his flour to others </span>so that they are able to bake for him if they so desire. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his flour is not prohibited, he need not transfer his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flour to others, </span>as they may bake for him even if the flour is not theirs. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>then, is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not prepare </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of cooked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> food</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on a Festival eve <span class="gemarra-regular">may neither bake, nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cook, nor insulate </span>food on the Festival for Shabbat that occurs on the following day, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither for himself nor for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">others, and others may neither bake nor cook for him. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">he do </span>so that he will have food to eat on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer his flour to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">others, and they may </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">bake and cook for him. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from here, </span>from the fact that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that he must transfer his flour to others, that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited and his flour is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that this is the case.
Another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transgressed </span>this prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">and bake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on a Festival for Shabbat without having placed an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the joining of cooked foods on the eve of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it permitted to partake of his bread and his cooking? The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this question from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not prepare </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of cooked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foods, what </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">he do </span>so that he will have food to eat on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">He must transfer his flour </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to others, and they may </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">bake and cook for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>

Daf 17b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so </span>that if one baked without having placed an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the joining of cooked foods, it is permitted to eat the bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> simply <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transgressed </span>the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">and baked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is permitted </span>to eat the bread. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Mattana said: </span>There is no proof from here, as the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is teaching a remedy </span>involving acting in<span class="gemarra-regular"> a permitted </span>manner, and <span class="gemarra-regular">is not teaching a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remedy </span>involving <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibited </span>act. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> did not want to teach that it is also possible to solve the problem in this proscribed manner. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who prepared </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cooked foods </span>on a Festival eve <span class="gemarra-regular">may bake and cook </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and insulate </span>food on the Festival for Shabbat that occurs on the following day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he wants to eat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiru</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has permission </span>to do so. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate it </span>on the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">before he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> baked </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">before he insulated, he may neither bake, nor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cook, nor insulate, neither for himself nor for others, </span>and likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">others may neither bake nor cook for him. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>even without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, one in this situation <span class="gemarra-regular">may cook for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he left over </span>part of what he cooked, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has left </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">over for Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, provided that he does not employ artifice </span>to circumvent the prohibition by saying that he is cooking a large amount for guests on the Festival, when in fact he has Shabbat in mind. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he employed artifice </span>to circumvent the prohibition, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to eat the food, by decree of the Sages. This indicates that one who cooks on a Festival for Shabbat in a prohibited manner may not eat the food.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>This is no proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">speak of </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">artifice, </span>and a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">artifice is different, as the Sages were more stringent with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>one who employs artifice <span class="gemarra-regular">than </span>with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally </span>cooks on a Festival for Shabbat. One who purposely transgresses is aware of his sin; therefore, he might repent and desist from his prohibited behavior, thereby preventing others from learning from his actions. However, one who employs artifice to circumvent a prohibition thinks that he is acting in a permitted manner. He is therefore likely to continue his practice. Furthermore, people might emulate him, and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of preparing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> might be forgotten.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said </span>that there is another reason to reject the proof from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya and in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may not bake </span>bread on a Festival for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he prepared an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for the joining of cooked foods on the eve of the Festival specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">with bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and one may not cook </span>any type of dish <span class="gemarra-regular">unless</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he prepared an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a cooked dish; and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not insulate </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there was hot </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">insulated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the eve of the Festival. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: One may prepare an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for the joining of cooked foods <span class="gemarra-regular">with one cooked dish and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> use it for all his needs, </span>i.e., baking, cooking, and insulating. Since Ḥananya’s opinion in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai is strict in this case, it may be assumed that he is stringent after the fact as well, and therefore the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> provides no proof. 
The Gemara offers yet another suggestion. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned</span> in amishna: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span>transgressed a rabbinic prohibition and <span class="gemarra-regular">tithed his produce on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, he may eat </span>of it; if he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, he may not eat </span>of it. This indicates that one may not derive benefit from a transgression that he committed intentionally. The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has other produce </span>and therefore does not greatly suffer as a result. However, the Sages may have been more lenient with one who did not make an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the joining of cooked food and consequently has nothing to eat.
The Gemara poses another resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a different source: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who immerses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his vessels on Shabbat, </span>an activity that the Sages prohibited because it is akin to repairing a vessel, if he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, he may use them; </span>however, if he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, he may not use them. </span>This shows that the product of an action performed in a prohibited manner is prohibited. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has other vessels </span>and is not forced to use these ones. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possible </span>for him to manage <span class="gemarra-regular">by borrowin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> vessels from others. But if one failed to set aside an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the joining of cooked foods, perhaps the Sages allowed him to eat the food he cooked on the Festival for Shabbat since it is difficult to obtain food from others on Shabbat.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which was taught in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who cooks on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, he may eat </span>the food that he cooked; but if he cooked it <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, he may not eat </span>it. This demonstrates that one who purposely violated a prohibition may not benefit from his prohibited action. The Gemara rejects this argument: There is no proof from here; the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition of Shabbat </span>desecration <span class="gemarra-regular">is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since it entails <span class="it-text">karet</span> and execution by a court. The same stringency might not necessarily apply to cooking on a Festival for the sake of the next day, and therefore the question raised above remains unresolved. 
§ It is stated in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say </span>that for the purpose of the joining of cooked foods one must prepare <span class="gemarra-regular">two cooked dishes, </span>whereas Beit Hillel say that one dish suffices. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who taught</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai and Beit Hillel agree that two dishes are necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. With regard to what do they disagree? </span>They disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>a fried <span class="gemarra-regular">fish and the egg on it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Beit Shammai say: Two </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">dishes </span>are required, and this fish is considered only a single dish; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hillel say: One dish </span>of this kind is viewed as two dishes and is therefore suitable for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the joining of cooked foods. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if one sliced </span>a cooked <span class="gemarra-regular">egg and placed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the fish, or if he mashed leeks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kaflotot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> placed </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">inside the fish, they are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">two dishes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that one dish suffices.
The mishna states that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ate </span>the food prepared before the Festival as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it was lost, he may not </span>rely <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cook </span>with the initial intent to cook for Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: We have a tradition </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>prepared a proper <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">began </span>kneading <span class="gemarra-regular">his doug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> on a Festival for Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the meantime <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was eaten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may finish </span>baking the bread. Since he had begun in a permitted manner, he is allowed to complete the process and bake the bread. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">occurs </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">after Shabbat, </span>i.e., on a Sunday, and one wishes to behave in a proper manner and purify himself and his vessels in honor of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One must immerse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> everything before Shabbat, and Beit Hillel say: Vessels </span>must be immersed <span class="gemarra-regular">before Shabbat, but a person </span>may immerse himself even <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel both <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that one may bring </span>ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">water into contact</span> with ritually pure water <span class="gemarra-regular">in stone vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to purify </span>the water. Impure water can be purified if it is placed into a vessel that does not contract ritual impurity, such as a stone vessel, and then lowered with the vessel into a ritual bath. The water becomes purified when it comes into contact with the water of the ritual bath. Although this is not considered proper immersion, water may nevertheless be purified in this manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one may not immers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the impure water in a ritually impure vessel in order to purify the vessel at the same time. Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may immerse </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">principle to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one group to another, </span>as will be explained in the Gemara. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> any event, everyone agrees, </span>i.e., both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree, that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>immerse <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that one may not do so? Which type of prohibited labor does it involve? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>issued by the Sages as a preventive measure, 

Daf 18a

<span class="gemarra-regular">lest one </span>come to <span class="gemarra-regular">pick up </span>the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">in his hand and carry it four cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the public domain </span>to a ritual bath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>Rabba: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one has a pit </span>full of water of a ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">in his courtyard, </span>so that this decree should not apply, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The Sages issued <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>against immersing vessels even in <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit </span>of water <span class="gemarra-regular">in one’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to a pit </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public domain.</span>
Abaye posed another challenge: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to a Festival, </span>when there is no prohibition against carrying from one domain to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say? </span>Rabba replied: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">issued a decree </span>that it is prohibited to immerse a vessel on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the prohibition against immersing it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do we issue a decree</span> in such a case? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel both <span class="gemarra-regular">agree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one may bring </span>ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">water into contact </span>with ritually pure water <span class="gemarra-regular">in stone vessels in order to purify</span> the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one may not immerse </span>the impure water in a ritually impure vessel in order to purify the vessel at the same time. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so</span> that such a decree was issued, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">decree</span> here that <span class="gemarra-regular">bringing </span>ritually impure water <span class="gemarra-regular">into contact </span>with ritually pure water is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">immersin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> a ritually impure vessel in a ritual bath. 
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>that there is substance to this question? <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">good, </span>ritually pure, <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>to drink, <span class="gemarra-regular">why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring this </span>ritually impure water <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contact </span>with the ritually pure water? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must say <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not have </span>suitable drinking water, <span class="gemarra-regular">and since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not have </span>other water, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>particularly <span class="gemarra-regular">careful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about </span>this water, so that it not become impure. Therefore, perforce, this must be an exceptional case, as the water became impure despite the precautions that were taken; and the Sages did not apply their decrees to unusual cases.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may draw water </span>from a spring or a ritual bath on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure pail</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the pail becomes ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>because while being filled with water, the bucket is completely immersed in the ritual bath. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so </span>that the Sages issued such a decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>here that it is prohibited to draw water on Festival with a ritually impure pail <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one come to immerse </span>the pail <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself. </span>Rabba answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there; since it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted for him </span>to immerse the pail <span class="gemarra-regular">only by drawin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> water with it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he remembers </span>that it is prohibited to immerse a vessel by itself, and therefore there is no reason to issue a decree. 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection </span>from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which it was taught: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel that was rendered ritually </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impure on the eve of a Festival, one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immerse it on the Festival; </span>however, if it became impure <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may immerse it on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival. And if it is so </span>that the Sages issued such a decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is prohibited to immerse a vessel that became impure on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival due to </span>the prohibition against immersing a vessel that became impure on the <span class="gemarra-regular">eve of a Festival. </span>Rabba answered: Contracting ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity on a Festival, </span>when all are ritually pure, <span class="gemarra-regular">is an uncommon occurrence, and </span>the general principle is that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncommon occurrence, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages did not issue a decree </span>as a preventive measure. 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>yet another <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel that was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rendered </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure by a primary source of impurity, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not immerse it on a Festival. </span>However, if it was rendered impure only <span class="gemarra-regular">by a derivative source of impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that the vessel came into contact with an object that was rendered impure by a primary source of impurity, so that the object has the status of first-degree ritual impurity and confers upon the vessel the status of second-degree ritual impurity, a type of impurity that applies to vessels only by rabbinic decree; in such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may immerse </span>the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so </span>that the Sages issued such a decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>here that it is prohibited to immerse <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>a vessel rendered impure by a derivative source of impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition to immerse <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>a vessel rendered impure by a primary source of impurity.
Rabba replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do you find </span>a case where people are particular about purifying a vessel that contracted ritual impurity from <span class="gemarra-regular">a derivative </span><span class="gemarra-regular">source of impurity? </span>It is only in one situation, namely, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to priests, </span>since they eat <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, and <span class="it-text">teruma</span> contracts ritual impurity even from a vessel that came into contact with only a derivative source of impurity. An ordinary person, who eats non-consecrated produce, does not go to the trouble of purifying such a vessel, since regular produce contracts ritual impurity only from a vessel that came into contact with a primary source of impurity, but not from a vessel that came into contact with a derivative source of impurity. And as for priests, the general principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">priests are vigilant; </span>they are careful not to allow their vessels to become impure. Therefore, impurity in the case of priests is considered a rare occurrence, with regard to which the Sages did not issue a decree.
The Gemara further suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a different proof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiyya bar Ashi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: A menstruating </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman who has no </span>ritually pure <span class="gemarra-regular">clothes </span>to wear after she immerses herself in a ritual bath to purify herself, as all her clothes had become impure, and it is Shabbat or a Festival, when she is unable to immerse them, <span class="gemarra-regular">may employ an artifice </span>to circumvent the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> herself <span class="gemarra-regular">in her clothes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> She is permitted to purify herself, and when she immerses herself while wearing her garments, they become purified at the same time. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is so </span>that the Sages issued such a decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>that it is prohibited for the woman to immerse herself in her clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">lest she come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to immerse </span>the clothes by <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there; since it is permitted for her </span>to immerse the clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">only by </span>wearing them as <span class="gemarra-regular">garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remembers </span>that it is prohibited to immerse them by themselves and will not come to violate this prohibition.
Apropos Rabba’s view that one may not immerse a vessel on Shabbat lest he come to carry it four cubits in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>that it is prohibited to immerse a vessel on Shabbat for a different reason: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>issued by the Sages as a preventive measure <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">wringing. </span>After immersing certain items, such as clothes, one might come to wring them, and this is prohibited on Shabbat and Festivals as a subcategory of the biblically prohibited labor of threshing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that are fit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for wringing, </span>such as clothes, but with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that are not fit for wringing, what is there to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say? </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to him: The Sages issued <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>vessels, which cannot be wrung, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>vessels, which can be wrung. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>against Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">all of these objections </span>that he had raised against Rabba, in an attempt to prove that the Sages did not issue such a decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">answered him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as we answered </span>in the name of Rabba.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai said </span>a different reason: The prohibition against immersing a vessel on a Festival is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>issued by the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one </span>come to <span class="gemarra-regular">dela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the immersion of his impure vessels. Were the Sages to permit him to immerse vessels on a Festival, he might delay immersing all of his impure vessels until the Festival, when he has more free time; and were he to leave ritually impure vessels in his possession for a lengthy period, he might come to defile items that must be kept ritually pure, such as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Beivai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> became ritually impure on the eve of a Festival, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not immerse it on a Festival, </span>due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decree lest he </span>come to <span class="gemarra-regular">delay </span>and keep impure vessels in his home in order to immerse them on the Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>yet a different reason: It is prohibited to immerse a vessel on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">because it looks as if he is repairing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the vessel was previously unfit for use, and the act of immersion renders it usable, this is similar to the repair of a vessel, which is Torah law proscribes on Shabbat and Festivals. The Gemara challenges this understanding: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, a person </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>be prohibited to immerse himself, because it looks as if he is repairing himself through purification. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person</span> undergoing immersion <span class="gemarra-regular">looks as if he is cooling </span>himself. Since it is not clearly evident that he is immersing in order to purify himself, as he might be bathing for his pleasure, there is no reason to prohibit the immersion.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well</span> in a case where he immerses himself in <span class="gemarra-regular">good, </span>clean <span class="gemarra-regular">water, </span>in which it would be a pleasure to bathe; but if he immerses himself in <span class="gemarra-regular">bad, </span>murky <span class="gemarra-regular">water, </span>as the water of a ritual bath is not always sufficiently clean, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? Rav Naḥman bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yitzḥak said: </span>Even in that case, his actions do not prove that his intention is to purify himself, as <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes a person comes </span>home

Daf 18b

<span class="gemarra-regular">on a hot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day and washes </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>putrid <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>in which flax <span class="gemarra-regular">was soaked, </span>because the heat has made him so uncomfortable.
The Gemara raises another objection: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well in the summer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> season; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the rainy season, </span>when people do not usually immerse themselves in water in order to cool off, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? Rav Naḥman bar Yitz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">ḥak said: Sometimes a person comes </span>home <span class="gemarra-regular">from the field</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> soiled with mud and excrement and washes </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">even in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the rainy season. </span>
The Gemara continues with another objection: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>and explains why it is permitted for one to immerse himself <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat, </span>when it is permitted to wash, and therefore it can be argued that it is not clearly evident that he is immersing in order to purify himself; but <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur, </span>when all bathing apart from ritual immersion is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> His actions prove that his intention is to purify himself, and this should be prohibited because it looks as though he is repairing himself through purification.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It is impossible to prohibit immersion on Yom Kippur alone, as <span class="gemarra-regular">is there anythin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is permitted on Shabbat and </span>the very same act is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>as labor <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kippur? </span>In fact, the prohibition against labor is more stringent on Shabbat than on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, since it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted on Shabbat, it is also permitted on Yom Kippur. </span>The Sages did not issue decrees with regard to Yom Kippur that would make it more stringent than Shabbat. Therefore, since they allowed a person to immerse on Shabbat because it looks as if he is doing so for pleasure, to escape the heat or to remove dirt, and not necessarily in order to purify himself, they permitted it on Yom Kippur as well, even though it is evident in that situation that his immersion is for the purpose of achieving purity. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does Rava accept </span>the principle of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is concerned </span>about pain <span class="gemarra-regular">in his teeth may not sip </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar through the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> on Shabbat in order to alleviate his toothache; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, he may dip </span>his food in vinegar <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>during the meal and eat it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he is healed </span>by the vinegar, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">healed. And we raised a contradiction to this </span>mishna from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not sip </span>vinegar <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">spit </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">out, </span>as this is clearly done for medicinal purposes; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, one may sip </span>the vinegar <span class="gemarra-regular">and swallow </span>it, since it looks as though he is drinking it. This indicates that there is a permitted way to use vinegar even without dipping his food into it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Also when we learned </span>this ruling in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mishna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>it with regard to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sips and spits </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">out</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna prohibits sipping vinegar even in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one sips and swallows </span>it, it is still <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> permits sipping vinegar <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dipping </span>one’s food in it, as he appears to be doing so for pleasure. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the mishna prohibits sipping the vinegar <span class="gemarra-regular">after dipping </span>his food in it, when it is clear that one is doing so for medicinal purposes only. 
The Gemara completes its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that Rava accepts the principle of: Since, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: Sinc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is permitted </span>to sip vinegar <span class="gemarra-regular">before dipping</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is also permitted </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">after dipping. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava retracted that </span>statement with regard to vinegar and accepted Abaye’s resolution of the difficulty, along with the principle of: Since. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>can it be determined <span class="gemarra-regular">that he retracted tha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> teaching? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he retracted this </span>statement with regard to immersion in a ritual bath on Yom Kippur. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This cannot enter your mind </span>that he retracted his view in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>who are <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in immersion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> immerse in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, both on the Ninth of Av and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur, </span>even though it is prohibited to wash on these days. Rava would certainly have aligned his opinion with the explicit ruling of a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel both <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that one may bring </span>ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into contact </span>with ritually pure water <span class="gemarra-regular">in stone vessels </span>in order to purify the water. However, one may not immerse the impure water. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the mishna’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one may not immerse </span>the impure water? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: One may not immerse </span>an impure <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel on account of its wate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to purify it on a Festival. </span>The Sages allowed impure water to be purified through contact with ritually pure water only in a stone vessel or in another vessel that does not contract impurity, but not in an impure vessel that would itself become purified through this immersion.
The Gemara asks: If that is its meaning, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is the mishna? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>with that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not immerse an </span>impure <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> account of its water </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to purify </span>the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may not bring </span>impure <span class="gemarra-regular">water into contact </span>with pure water <span class="gemarra-regular">in a stone vessel </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to purify</span> the water; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: One may immerse </span>an impure <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on account of its water </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to purify </span>the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may bring </span>impure <span class="gemarra-regular">water into contact </span>with pure water <span class="gemarra-regular">in a stone vessel </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to purify</span> the water. 
If so, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, then the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">bringing </span>impure <span class="gemarra-regular">water into contact </span>with pure water in a stone vessel is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi prohibits doing so, whereas the mishna permits it; and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>then the ruling with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion</span> of an impure vessel on account of its water is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> the Rabbis permit this, while the mishna, as explained by Shmuel, prohibits it.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you wish, say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi; and <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, say </span>instead that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi and explain that the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause of </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the first part of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, deals with <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>it is in that case that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi prohibits immersing an impure vessel on account of its water, but bringing impure water into contact with pure water in a stone vessel would be permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the latter clause, </span>which extends the prohibition to bringing impure water into contact with pure water, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the more stringent case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. And the entire mishna </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when it is permitted to purify impure water by bringing it into contact with pure water in a stone vessel. 

Daf 19a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>and on a Festival one is permitted even to immerse an impure vessel on account of its water in order to purify the vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the entire mishna </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat, </span>when it is prohibited to immerse an impure vessel, but it is permitted to purify impure water by bringing it into contact with pure water in a stone vessel.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel that became ritually impure on the eve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a Festival, one may not immerse it during twilight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a time period of doubtful status whether it is a weekday or a Festival, due to the possibility of violating the prohibition against immersing vessels on a Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even on a weekday</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may not immers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> an impure vessel during twilight <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">requires sunset. </span>After an impure vessel is immersed, it remains ritually impure for certain purposes until the sun has set and the stars have come out. If one immerses an impure vessel during the twilight period, thenowing to the uncertainty as to whether it is day or night, he must wait another full day, until the next sunset, before using the vessel. It is therefore preferable not to put oneself in a situation where one might come to use a vessel before its purification process has been completed. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not require sunset? </span>It is clear that this is required. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: I found the Sages of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rav sitting and saying </span>with regard to this issue that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree about </span>whether or not to accept the principle that one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intention is evident from his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">actions. And what are the circumstances </span>of this dispute? They are, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one was holding a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessel in his hand and running along at </span>the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">twilight to immerse it.</span>
This <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is running along </span>indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">he knows that </span>the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">requires sunset. </span>If he arrives at the ritual bath late, he will realize that he must wait another day, and there is no concern that he might come to use the vessel on the same day. Consequently, it is prohibited to immerse the vessel during twilight on the eve of a Festival, as, since it may already be night and he will be unable to use the vessel until the next evening, immersing the vessel would be considered to be preparing something on a Festival for a weekday, which is prohibited. However, it is permitted to immerse a vessel during twilight on an ordinary weekday evening.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> running due to his work </span>that he has not finished on time, and not necessarily because he knows that the purification of his vessel requires sunset. He believes that he may use the vessel immediately upon immersion; therefore, the Sages decreed that one should never immerse vessels during twilight.
Rava continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I said to them: With regard to</span> the principle that one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intention is evident from his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> actions, everyone agrees </span>that this is accepted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where they disagree</span> is, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impure through </span>contact with a creeping animal <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lentil-bul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> in size, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the vessel’s owner <span class="gemarra-regular">came before the Sages to ask </span>whether a vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impure through </span>contact with <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a lentil-bulk or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not. One Sage, </span>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not know this </span>matter that a creeping animal smaller than a lentil-bulk does not impart impurity, it stands to reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">he also does not know </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">sunset; </span>therefore, there is reason to prohibit him from immersing vessels during twilight even on a weekday. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sage, </span>the Rabbis, who permit such immersion on a weekday, <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the size of a creeping animal that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not know, but </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">sunset he does know, </span>as it is stated explicitly in the Torah.
It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may immerse </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">principle</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another </span>and from one group to another. The Gemara attempts to clarify the meaning of this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>does one immerse <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">principle</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One who wishes to make his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> winepress, </span>meaning to immerse and purify vessels for the sake of his winepress, <span class="gemarra-regular">in addition to </span>the purification of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">pitcher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> may do so. In other words, if at first he merely intended to immerse his impure pitcher, but subsequently changed his mind and decided to use it for his winepress, and he wishes to immerse the pitcher a second time for the sake of the winepress, it is permitted to do so. 
Similarly, one who wishes to make <span class="gemarra-regular">his pitcher in addition</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the purification of his vessels for the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">his winepress may do </span>so. That is to say, if he originally intended to use the pitcher for his winepress, and after immersing it he decided not to use it for that purpose, and now he wishes to immerse his pitcher a second time, it is permitted to do so. Since the second immersion does not purify the vessel or fulfill any obligation, it is not considered a proper immersion and is not prohibited on a Festival.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>does one immerse <span class="gemarra-regular">from one group to another? </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span> planning to <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the Paschal offering <span class="gemarra-regular">with this group, </span>and he immersed himself or his ritually impure vessels for that purpose; and now he has reconsidered <span class="gemarra-regular">and wishes to eat</span> the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">with a different group, </span>and he wants to immerse himself or his vessels a second time for the second group, in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">he has permission </span>to do so even on a Festival, for the same reason: Since this immersion is not obligatory, it is not viewed as an immersion at all.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> peace-offerings </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one may not place</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as this is considered using animals, which is prohibited on a Festival by rabbinic decree. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one may not </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offerings, </span>apart from the obligatory daily and additional offerings of the day, because burnt-offerings are consumed entirely on the altar and not by people, and slaughter is permitted on a Festival only for the purpose of human consumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One may bring </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">peace-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">hands on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">to Festival peace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offerings, </span>an obligation of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">with respect to placing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hands </span>on them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to burnt-offerings of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">appearance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which must be brought over the course of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">with respect to sacrificing </span>them. As <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai hold </span>that the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall observe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vaḥaggotem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] it as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival to the Lord </span>seven days in the year” (Leviticus 23:41) indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span><span class="gemarra-regular">peace-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥagiga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], yes, </span>they may be sacrificed even on a Festival day, but <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of appearance, no, </span>they may not. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hold: “To the Lord” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything </span>brought <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Lord </span>may be sacrificed throughout the seven days of the holiday, even on the actual Festival day. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings, </span>which are not part of the obligations of the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree, </span>even Beit Hillel, that they <span class="gemarra-regular">may not be sacrificed on a Festival. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival. </span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against Ulla’s statement from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offering that is not </span>part of the requirements <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Festival, </span>such as a vow-offering or a gift-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">that it may not be sacrificed on a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival, or with regard to peace-offerings that are </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Festival </span>obligations, such as Festival peace-offerings or peace-offerings of rejoicing, <span class="gemarra-regular">that they may be sacrificed on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival, </span>as the Festival is their designated time, and if one fails to bring them then he will be unable to sacrifice them later. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">did they disagree? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering that is </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Festival </span>requirements, such as the burnt-offering of appearance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">peace-offerings that are not </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Festival </span>obligations, such as vow-offerings and gift-offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: He may not bring </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He may bring </span>them.

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Resolve </span>the contradiction by emending the text, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as follows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to burnt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings and peace-offerings that are not </span>part of the requirements <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Festival, </span>such as vow-offerings and gift-offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">that they are </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">not sacrificed on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to peace-offerings that are </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Festival </span>obligations, such as Festival peace-offerings or peace-offerings of rejoicing, <span class="gemarra-regular">that they may be sacrificed on a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival.

<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings, all agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not be sacrificed on </span>the actual <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as stated by Ulla and Rav Adda bar Ahava.

The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not bring a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thanks-offering on the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Matzot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread </span>included <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that one may not bring this offering on Passover, as it contains leavened bread. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak, said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Abba </span>who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not discussing Passover itself; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>a thanks-offering sacrificed on <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourteenth </span>of Nisan, i.e., on Passover eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not bring consecrated </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">to a situation </span>where the time that they may be eaten is restricted, thereby increasing <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>likelihood of <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although it is permitted to eat leavened bread until the sixth hour of the fourteenth of Nisan, one may not bring a thanks-offering on Passover eve. The reason is that a thanks-offering may usually be eaten for one full day and the following night, and if it is brought on the eve of Passover, the time available before disqualification is reduced.
It was further taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor </span>may one bring a thanks-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because it is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival. </span>The Gemara explains: This <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, a person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">When? If we say </span>he may bring it <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival day </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>this is difficult, <span class="gemarra-regular">as didn’t you say: Nor</span> may one bring a thanks-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a Festival, </span>indicating that a thanks-offering may not be brought on an actual Festival day? The same should apply to <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it means that one may bring it <span class="gemarra-regular">on the intermediate days of the Festival.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: But it says: “On the festival </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Matzot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, on the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>to teach: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Matzot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may come on the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Matzot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and on the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not come on the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Matzot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not come on the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This seems to indicate that thanks-offerings may not be brought on any Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira </span><span class="gemarra-regular">strongly objects to this: Now, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">we may cho</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> kindling wood on the intermediate days of the Festival for the sake of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it necessary </span>to state that it is permitted to sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings</span> on the intermediate Festival days? How can it be suggested that Rabbi Shimon prohibits bringing thanks-offerings on the intermediate days of the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to sacrificing </span>these offerings on the intermediate days of a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that it is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree, </span>it is not with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a Festival but with respect <span class="gemarra-regular">to determining when one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable for </span>violating the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You must not delay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If one vows to bring an offering but fails to fulfill his pledge, how much time must pass before he transgresses the prohibition: “You shall not delay to pay it” (Deuteronomy 23:22)?
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states three Festivals </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">even not in their </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">order, </span>meaning not in accordance with the yearly cycle found in the Torah: Passover, <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>, <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>. As soon as three Festivals have passed from the day a person took his vow, if he has yet to bring his offering, he has transgressed the prohibition against delaying. Therefore, the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> advises a person who vowed to bring a thanks-offering to do so on <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, even if it is the first Festival after his vow, and even though it is not the first Festival listed by the Torah. If he fails to do so, he will have to make a special trip to Jerusalem in order to sacrifice the offering, as he will not be able to sacrifice it on Passover due to the leavened bread it contains, or on <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span> because it does not have intermediate Festival days. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon holds </span>that if three Festivals have passed <span class="gemarra-regular">in their</span> proper <span class="gemarra-regular">order, yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he has violated the prohibition against delaying; but if they have passed <span class="gemarra-regular">not in their </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">order, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>violated the prohibition. If, for example, one vowed to bring an offering between Passover and <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>, he may put off bringing the offering until <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> of the following year, and therefore he would not be required to travel an extra time to Jerusalem specifically for this purpose.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: A person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">When? If we say </span>that he means <span class="gemarra-regular">on the intermediate days of the Festival, this is </span>identical to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tann</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he must be referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings may be sacrificed on a Festival.</span>
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he cited it </span>specifically as an example of a Festival? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, </span>and this ruling too is related to the prohibition against delaying. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>The verse did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have to <span class="gemarra-regular">say “the festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” of which the </span>immediately preceding <span class="gemarra-regular">verse was speaking; </span>it was only necessary to add the other Festivals. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>“the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>” <span class="gemarra-regular">stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that this </span>Festival, i.e., <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">must be the last one </span>with regard to the prohibition against delaying; one transgresses the prohibition only if the three Festivals have passed in their proper order, so that <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> is the last of the three.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon, says: </span>It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that this </span>Festival is what <span class="gemarra-regular">causes </span>a person to be late in fulfilling his vow. In his view, the prohibition against delaying does not depend on the number of Festivals. Rather, it means that by the time of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, the last Festival according to the yearly cycle found in the Torah, one must have brought all of his vow-offerings of that year. Even one who vowed to bring an offering just before <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> must bring his offering before the Festival ends. 
It is taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A person may bring his thanks-offering on the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and fulfill with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it his obligation </span>to bring peace-offerings of <span class="gemarra-regular">rejoicing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but he does not fulfill </span>with it the obligation to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival </span>peace-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that one does not fulfill his obligation to bring a Festival peace-offering with his thanks-offering. The Festival peace-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is an obligatory matter, </span>as everyone is obligated to bring this offering, and the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that is an obligatory matte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must come only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from that which is non-sacred, </span>meaning that one cannot bring an obligatory offering from an animal that has already been consecrated for another purpose. It follows that one cannot discharge his obligation to bring a Festival peace-offering with a thanks-offering, as he is already obligated to bring the latter and has consecrated the animal for this purpose.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in order to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that even if one specified </span>at the time of his vow that he is consecrating the animal as a thanks-offering on condition that it may be used as a Festival peace-offering as well, he nevertheless does not fulfill his obligation with it.
This teaching is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the question <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> asked of Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span> vows and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>It is incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon me </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a thanks-offering, and I will </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfill </span>my obligation to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival </span>peace-<span class="gemarra-regular">offering with it; </span>or if he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am a nazirite, </span>

Daf 20a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and I will shave </span>my head, meaning I will purchase the nazirite offerings that are brought when a nazirite shaves himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">with second-tithe money, </span>which I am obligated in any case to bring to Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>With regard to the thanks-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has vowed </span>and must bring the offering, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not fulfill </span>his obligation of the Festival peace-offering with it, as the latter offering must be brought from unconsecrated animals. Similarly, one who took the vow of naziriteship is <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite, but he may not shav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> his head and bring nazirite offerings purchased with second-tithe money.
In relation to the previous case, in which one makes a conditional statement and only part of his statement is accepted, the Gemara relates a somewhat similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain man said to </span>those tending to him, in the form of a will: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give four hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to so-and-so, and let him marr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred </span><span class="it-text">zuz</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes, but </span>as for the benefactor’s <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wishes, he may marry </span>her, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wishes, he</span> need <span class="gemarra-regular">not marry </span>her. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>is solely <span class="gemarra-regular">that he said </span>it in this manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give him </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">and let him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> marry </span>my daughter, mentioning the gift before the condition. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>he specified the condition first, by <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him marry </span>my daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">and give him </span>the money, in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he marries </span>her, <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes </span>the money, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not marry </span>her, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take </span>it. 
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Mareima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sat and stated this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> with regard to one who attaches a condition to his vow to bring a thanks-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">in his own name, </span>without attributing it to the Sage who stated it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Mareimar: You teach this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in this manner, </span>without attribution, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">we teach it </span>in the form of a question that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish asked of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Abba: </span>The verse concerning the burnt-offering that Aaron was commanded to sacrifice for the inauguration of the Tabernacle: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he brought the burnt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation” </span>(Leviticus 9:16), indicates that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an obligatory burnt-offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the regulation </span>governing <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift burnt-offering. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches with regard to an obligatory burnt-offering </span>that it too <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>the person bringing the offering to <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">hands </span>on the head of the animal to be sacrificed. 
Rabbi Yitzḥak <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span>: He <span class="gemarra-regular">who told you </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> requires an explicit biblical source, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose</span> opinion did he say this? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai, who do not learn </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">obligatory peace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offerings from </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift peace-offerings </span>by way of an analogy [<span class="it-text">binyan</span> <span class="it-text">av</span>], as they distinguish between the two with regard to the requirement of placing hands on the peace-offerings brought on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>it were the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, since they learn </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">obligatory peace-offerings from </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift peace-offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>there being no distinction between the two categories, then <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obligatory burnt-offering should also not require a </span>special <span class="gemarra-regular">verse</span> to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>they can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift burnt-offering </span>by means of an analogy. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>may it be shown that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learn </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">obligatory peace-offerings from </span>those of <span class="gemarra-regular">gift peace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offerings? Perhaps </span>they do not learn the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of obligatory peace-offerings from those of gift peace-offerings. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing obligatory peace-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">an obligatory burnt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Just as an obligatory burnt-offering requires the one bringing the offering to place his hands on the animal to be sacrificed, so too do obligatory peace-offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">And an obligatory burnt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself requires</span> an explicit <span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>from which to derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and perhaps the verse cited above is the source: “And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation.”
The Gemara challenges this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about obligatory peace-offerings such <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">do not learn </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing them <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applying to <span class="gemarra-regular">gift peace-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>gift peace-offerings are more <span class="gemarra-regular">common, </span>and perhaps a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to them. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should also not learn </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing obligatory peace-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applying to <span class="gemarra-regular">an obligatory burnt-offering, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the latter is <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely burnt, </span>unlike peace-offerings.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing obligatory peace-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from between </span>the two of <span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Torah explicitly states that one must place hands on the heads of both obligatory burnt-offerings and gift peace-offerings. It is possible to extend the same obligation to obligatory peace-offerings by combining the two sources, as follows: If one says that an obligatory burnt-offering is different from an obligatory peace-offering because it is entirely burnt, gift peace-offerings prove that this is not the critical factor; and if one counters that gift peace-offerings are different from obligatory peace-offerings because they are common, an obligatory burnt-offering proves that this is not crucial. Therefore, there is no proof from here with regard to Beit Hillel’s position, as they too might learn the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing an obligatory burnt-offering from the verse: “And he brought the burnt-offering and sacrificed it according to regulation.”
The Gemara raises a question with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do Beit Shammai hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">obligatory </span><span class="gemarra-regular">peace-offerings do not require placing of hands </span>on the head of the animal? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: Beit Shammai and Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel did not disagree with regard to the placing of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself that it is required </span>in the case of obligatory peace-offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">did they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree? </span>They disagreed with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that states that <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">placing hands </span>on the head of an offering is its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As Beit Shammai say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not necessary </span>to be particular in this regard, and the ceremony of placing hands on the animal’s head may be performed even on the eve of the Festival, long before the animal is slaughtered. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary, </span>and therefore one who brings an offering on a Festival must place his hands on the animal’s head on the Festival itself.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>what he said <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, said: Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">placing hands </span>on the head of an offering is its <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter, that it is necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. With regard to what, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">did they disagree? </span>They disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the placing of hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself </span>on the head of obligatory peace-offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not necessary, and Beit Hillel say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The Gemara returns to the basic dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an incident involving Hillel the Elder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who brought his burnt-offering to the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in order to place </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">hands on </span>the animal’s head <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. The students of Shammai the Elder</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gathered around him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nature of this animal </span>that you are bringing? Hillel, being humble and meek, did not want to quarrel with them in the Temple and therefore concealed the truth from them for the sake of peace. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a female, and I have brought it as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> peace-offering, </span>as burnt-offerings are always male. <span class="gemarra-regular">He swung</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its tail for them </span>so that they would not be able to properly discern whether the animal was male or female, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they departed. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">On</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that day, </span>when the incident became known, suggesting that even Hillel had accepted Shammai’s view, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai gained the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upper hand over Beit Hillel, and they sought to establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in this regard <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with their </span>opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">But a certain Elder of the disciples of Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Elder was there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Bava ben But</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">his name, who knew that </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel </span>in this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he sent </span>for

<span class="gemarra-regular">and brought all the </span>high-quality <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Kedar that </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he stood them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and said: Anyone who wishes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">hands </span>on the head of an animal should <span class="gemarra-regular">come and place </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">hands </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gained the upper hand </span>over Beit Shammai, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they established the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with their </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there was no one there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who disputed the matter in any way.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>some time later <span class="gemarra-regular">there was another incident involving a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">certain disciple from among the disciples of Beit Hillel who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brought his burnt-offering to the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard in order </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to place </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">hands on </span>the animal’s head on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain disciple from among the disciples of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai found him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this placing of hands</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why do you place your hands on the animal’s head and thereby violate the statement of Beit Shammai? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this silence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why do you not stay silent, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was not established in accordance with their opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">He silenced him with a rebuke, and he, </span>Beit Shammai’s disciple, <span class="gemarra-regular">departed </span>quietly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Therefore, </span>it is clear from here that <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar whose colleague says something </span>reprimanding or insulting <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not answer back </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">something more than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his colleague had said to him, </span>to avoid adding fuel to the fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in the above story <span class="gemarra-regular">the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to </span>the other: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this placing of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hands? and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">responded to </span>the former using the same language: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this silence?</span>
§ With regard to the dispute concerning the sacrifice of burnt-offerings of appearance on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: Just as in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place where it is prohibited </span>to slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">a common person [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hedyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to slaughter offerings in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Most High, </span>such as the daily and additional offerings, then so too, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted </span>to slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">a common</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person, </span>e.g., on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> right that </span>it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Most High? </span>This argument should include burnt-offerings of appearance as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai said to them: </span>This is no proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings prove </span>that this reasoning is not valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to slaughter an animal on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">common</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span> to slaughter vow-offerings and gift-offerings on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Most High.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them: If vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings </span>may not be slaughtered on a Festival, that is <span class="gemarra-regular">because they do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have a fixed time </span>and there is no obligation to sacrifice them on a Festival in particular, but can <span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a burnt-offering of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> appearance, which has a fixed time, </span>the Festival itself? <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai said to them: It too has no fixed time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bring </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival offering on the first Festival </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may bring </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the entire Festival, including the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> last Festival </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>on the Eighth Day of Assembly, as that day is regarded as part of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> for this purpose. This shows that a burnt-offering of appearance need not be brought at a fixed time on the Festival either. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel said to them: </span>Although a burnt-offering of appearance need not be sacrificed on a particular day of the Festival, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">it too has a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fixed time, </span>albeit a lengthier one. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival passed and he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not bring his Festival-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is not accountable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for it. </span>That is to say, he is not required to bring another offering, as the mitzva has already passed. This indicates that the offering is limited specifically to the Festival days, unlike vow-offerings and gift-offerings, which may be brought at any time.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai said to </span>Beit Hillel in support of their own position: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it already</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>in the verse: “Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done <span class="gemarra-regular">for you” </span>(Exodus 12:16), which indicates that for you may food be prepared, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not for the Most High</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beit Hillel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: But wasn’t it already stated </span>in the verse: “You shall observe it as a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 23:41), which teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anything </span>sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord </span>may be sacrificed? <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “for you”? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you, but not for gentiles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you, but not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for dogs. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shau</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>the same disagreement <span class="gemarra-regular">in a different formulation, </span>that Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where your stove is closed, </span>i.e., on Shabbat, when a person may not cook for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">your Master’s stove is open, </span>as it is permitted to light a fire on the altar and sacrifice offerings upon it, so too, <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where your stove </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is open, </span>i.e., on a Festival, when one may cook food that he will eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that your Master’s stove </span>should be <span class="gemarra-regular">open</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>stands <span class="gemarra-regular">to reason that your table should not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be full while your Master’s table, </span>the altar, remains <span class="gemarra-regular">empty.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and Abba Shaul <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>in their different versions of Beit Hillel’s statement? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage, </span>Abba Shaul, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that according to Beit Hillel, even <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings may be sacrificed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, </span>and therefore Beit Shammai could not cite as proof the fact that they may not be sacrificed, as they claim in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that according to Beit Hillel, vow-offerings and gift-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">may not be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificed on a Festival, </span>and therefore Beit Shammai could adduce this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in support of their opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">According to the statement of the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings may not be sacrificed on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, you </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not say that by Torah law </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>to be sacrificed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages who issued a decree about them </span>that they should not be sacrificed on a Festival as <span class="gemarra-regular">a preventive measure, lest one delay </span>sacrificing them until the Festival, when it is more convenient for him to bring them to the Temple, and thereby transgress the prohibition against delaying the fulfillment of one’s pledge.
This is not the reason; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>according to this opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are not fit </span>to be sacrificed on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law. As the two loave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> brought on the festival of <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are an obligation of </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">day, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is no </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">to issue a decree </span>about them <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one </span>come to <span class="gemarra-regular">delay </span>their offering, since they may be brought only on that Festival, and yet their baking and preparation <span class="gemarra-regular">override neither Shabbat nor the Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to this view, anything that need not be performed on the Festival itself may not be done on the Festival. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the statement of the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be sacrificed on a Festival, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one transgressed and slaughtered </span>those vow-offerings and gift-offerings on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: He sprinkles the blood </span>of these offerings on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to allow the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meat to be eaten </span>on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: He sprinkles the blood in order to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burn the sacrificial parts </span>of the animal, including the fats and other portions that are brought upon the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the evening. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinion of Rava and that of Rabba bar Rav Huna, since both agree that the blood is sprinkled? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the meat became </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure or was lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. According to Rava, </span>who holds that the blood is sprinkled in order to permit the meat to be eaten, by rabbinic decree <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not sprinkl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the blood, as this sprinkling is not required for the Festival. On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabba bar Rav Huna, </span>who holds that the blood is sprinkled in order to burn the sacrificial parts upon the altar in the evening, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sprinkle </span>the blood, even though it does not enable him to eat the meat.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the opinion of Rabba bar Rav Huna from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the lambs of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the two lambs sacrificed as peace-offerings that accompany the two loaves of bread brought on that Festival, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one slaughtered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them not for their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">purpose, </span>i.e., at the time of slaughter his intent was to slaughter them as a different offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered them </span>not at their proper time, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether before their time or after their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time, </span>the offerings themselves are valid, although the community has not fulfilled its obligation. What is to be done with them? <span class="gemarra-regular">The blood </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">be sprinkle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the meat </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">be eaten. And if </span>the day he slaughtered the lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">was Shabbat, </span>on which cooking or roasting the meat is prohibited, then since the sprinkling of the blood serves no purpose, neither with regard to their mitzva nor for any other matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not sprinkle </span>the blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkled </span>the blood, 

Daf 21a

the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is accepted on condition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">burn the sacrificial parts </span>that are brought upon the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">in the evenin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> and not during the day. The wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that if the meat may not be eaten on that day, then only <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkled </span>the blood, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">after the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fact, yes, </span>it is permitted; however, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sprinkle it <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Granted, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span> it works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well, but according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>The Gemara comments: Indeed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">A rabbinic decree concerning Shabbat is different from a rabbinic</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decree concerning a Festival, </span>as the Sages were more stringent with regard to Shabbat than with regard to Festivals.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Avya the Elder raised </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Huna: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>is owned in partnership, <span class="gemarra-regular">half of it </span>belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to a gentile and half of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it to a Jew, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to slaughtering it on a Festival? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: It is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rav Avya <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-offerings? </span>Vow-offerings and gift-offerings are similar to jointly owned animals, as part of the animal is sacrificed upon the altar while the other part is eaten by the owner and the priest. Why, then, is it not similarly permitted to slaughter them on a Festival? Seeking to distract Rav Avya so that he need not answer his question, Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Look, <span class="gemarra-regular">a raven flie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in the sky. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rav Avya <span class="gemarra-regular">left, Rabba, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>Rav Huna, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>his father: <span class="gemarra-regular">Was this not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Avya the Elder, whom Master would recommend to </span>us, saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is a great man? </span>If so, why did you treat him in that manner and evade his question? Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What should I have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> done for him? Today I am </span>in a state best described by the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Let me lean against the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stout trunks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let me couch among the apple trees” </span>(Song of Songs 2:5), meaning I am worn out and exhausted from all the communal responsibility that has fallen upon me, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he asked me </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">something that requires reasoning</span> and careful examination, and therefore I could not provide an immediate answer.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason? </span>The Gemara explains the difference between a jointly owned animal and a vow-offering or gift-offering: A jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">animal, half of </span>which belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to a gentile and half to a Jew, may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be slaughtered on a Festival, as it is impossible to</span> obtain <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk of meat without slaughtering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If a Jew wishes to eat even a small portion of meat, he has no alternative but to slaughter an entire animal, even though he will not use all of it. Therefore, it does not matter if part of the animal belongs to a gentile. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, it is prohibited to slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vow</span>-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and gift-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival, </span>because in this case there is no real joint ownership of the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">priests, when they receive </span>their portions of the meat of the offering, and similarly, when Israelites partake of the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">they receive </span>their portions <span class="gemarra-regular">from the table</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Most High. </span>In other words, the entire offering belongs to God, and those who partake of it are considered guests at His table; and as stated above, one may not slaughter an animal on a Festival for the sake of God.
In continuation of the previous discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: A </span>jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">animal, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half of </span>which belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to a gentile and half to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, may be slaughtered on a Festival because it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is impossible to </span>obtain <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk of meat without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering. </span>However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">dough, half </span>of which belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and half to a Jew, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited to bake i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is possible for him to divide it </span>in half <span class="gemarra-regular">during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the kneading </span>and bake only the part that belongs to the Jew. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai raised an objection</span> from the following mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Dough </span>for bread that is meant <span class="gemarra-regular">for dogs, when </span>it is of such quality that even <span class="gemarra-regular">shepherds eat of it, </span>is considered like regular bread. Accordingly, one <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated </span>to separate <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span> from such dough, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>may use it to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., a joining of courtyards and a joining of Shabbat boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to establish a merging of alleyways, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one recites a blessing </span>before and after eating <span class="gemarra-regular">it, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one invites </span>those with whom he ate to recite Grace after Meals after eating <span class="gemarra-regular">it, and it may be baked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival, </span>like all foods fit for human consumption, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a person fulfills his obligation </span>to eat <span class="it-text">matza</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> the first night of <span class="gemarra-regular">Passover with it </span>if it has not leavened. 
With regard to the allowance to bake this dough, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>may it be baked on a Festival? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it possible to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divide it during the kneading, </span>so that he bakes only the portion to be eaten by people and leaves aside the part given to dogs? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Dough </span>for bread meant for <span class="gemarra-regular">dogs is different, since it is possible</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to appease them with a carcass. </span>It is possible that one of his animals will die, and he will feed the carcass to the dogs, in which case all of the dough will be eaten by people.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does Rav Ḥisda accept </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that since it is possible that the situation may change, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not determined based on the current circumstances? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed about the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing one <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">bakes on a Festival </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">for a weekday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda said: He is flogged </span>for desecrating the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: He is not flogged. </span>
The Gemara explains the two opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is flogged </span>because he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">guests happen to </span>visit <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>whatever he bakes <span class="gemarra-regular">will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit for him </span>on the Festival itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">now too, </span>although guests have not yet arrived, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him. </span>According to that logic, baking would not be considered a full-fledged transgression, and one cannot be forewarned about it and does not receive lashes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He is not flogged, </span>as he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the principle of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since. </span>As Rav Ḥisda himself does not accept the principle of since, how can it be used to resolve a difficulty raised against him? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara retracts its previous answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not say </span>that dough for dogs is different, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is possible </span>that one of his animals will die and he will appease the dogs with the carcass. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the reference here is to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has a carcass </span>ready, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is certainly possible to appease them with the carcass. </span>Consequently, when the shepherds bake the dough, it is highly likely that they will consume it all themselves.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised a dilemma before Rav Huna: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> Jewish <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of a village [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">baga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon whom </span>the authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">imposed </span>the obligation to supply <span class="gemarra-regular">flour </span>and bread <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">military troop</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> serving in the area, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">baking it on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>them: <span class="gemarra-regular">We examine </span>the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>those villagers can <span class="gemarra-regular">give bread </span>from the soldiers’ quota <span class="gemarra-regular">to a child and </span>the soldiers <span class="gemarra-regular">are not particular </span>about it, then <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every one </span>of the loaves <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit for </span>a Jewish <span class="gemarra-regular">child, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to bake them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the soldiers do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>allow anyone else to partake of their bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>to bake the loaves for them on a Festival.
The Gemara challenges Rav Huna’s lenient ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an incident involving </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon the Timnite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who did not come </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">night </span>of the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">to the study hall. In the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">morning, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava found him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Why did you not come last night to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">study hall? He said to him: A military unit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on a search mission </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">balleshet</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">came to our city and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wanted to pillage the entire city. We slaughtered a calf </span>in order to placate them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we fed them </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">and had them depart in peace.</span>
Rav Yehuda ben Bava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: I wonder if your gain, </span>that which you saved by preventing the soldiers from taking your possessions, <span class="gemarra-regular">was not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> outweighed by your loss, </span>the punishment for your desecration of the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Torah states: </span>“Only that which every soul must eat, that alone may be done <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you” </span>(Exodus 12:16), which indicates that food may be prepared for you, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not for gentiles. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> why </span>did Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava say this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t</span> some portion of the calf <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to be eaten by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them? </span>The conclusion seems to be that even if a Jew may eat from an animal, it may not be slaughtered on a Festival for the sake of a gentile. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef said: </span>In that case it <span class="gemarra-regular">was a calf with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a condition that would cause it to die within twelve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>which may not be eaten by Jews. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be eaten by dogs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it could be argued that it was slaughtered for the sake of dogs belonging to Jews?
The Gemara answers: The question of whether or not one may perform prohibited labor on a Festival for the sake of dogs <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Only that which every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> soul must eat, that alone may be done for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.” By inference, from that which is stated: “Every soul,” I</span> might <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even the soul of an animal is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> included, similar to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is stated: “And he that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> kills the soul of an animal shall pay it” </span>(Leviticus 24:18), indicating that the life force of an animal is also called a soul. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>and emphasizes: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For you,” </span>

Daf 21b

indicating <span class="gemarra-regular">for you, but not for dogs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva says: </span>When the verse states “every soul,” it comes to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">even the soul of an animal is included</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. If so, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “for you”? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">for you, but not for gentiles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what did you see </span>that led you <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> include dogs </span>among those on whose behalf one is permitted to perform a labor on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to exclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentiles? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">I include dogs because </span>the responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their sustenance is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you, </span>as one is obligated to feed the animals in his possession; <span class="gemarra-regular">and I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclude gentiles because </span>the responsibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">their sustenance is not</span> incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you.</span>
With regard to this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef: And according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said</span> that the verse indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For you,” but not for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dogs, how </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">cast date stones to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival? </span>Since date stones are not fit for human consumption, they should be considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, and therefore it should be prohibited to handle them.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Since they are fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for fuel, </span>they may be handled, and therefore they may also be given to animals. Abaye objected: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>date stones; but <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">moist ones, </span>which are not suited for fuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? He said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They are fit for a large fire, </span>which dries them out, after which they burn well.
Abaye raised another objection: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, </span>when it is permitted to fuel a fire, but <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what is there to say? </span>Why should one be permitted to handle date stones on Shabbat? Rav Yosef answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carry them along with bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> We place the date stones upon a loaf of bread and move them together with it. This is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, as Shmuel said: A person may perform all his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> needs with bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> as long as the bread remains edible, he need not be concerned that he is treating the bread contemptuously.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the ruling of Rav Huna that one is permitted to bake for gentiles on a Festival if they allow a Jew to eat of the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">differs from </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As Rabbi Yehoshua ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levi said: One may invite a gentile </span>for a meal <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he will certainly not cook for him on Shabbat, and it is permitted to give a gentile food that was prepared the day before. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not invite a gentile </span>for a meal <span class="gemarra-regular">on a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this is prohibited as <span class="gemarra-regular">a preventive measure lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>come to cook <span class="gemarra-regular">more for </span>the gentile’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This indicates that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi holds that one may not prepare more for a gentile, even if the meal is primarily meant for Jews.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Even on Shabbat as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>invite a gentile for a meal <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">remnants in the cups. </span>Once a gentile has drunk wine from a cup, whatever remains in the cup may not be used and is therefore considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. Therefore, a Jew may not host a gentile on Shabbat lest he come to handle the <span class="it-text">muktze</span> wine remnants on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, our </span>cups <span class="gemarra-regular">should also </span>be prohibited, as they too contain wine remnants that have no use whatsoever and should therefore be considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. The Gemara answers: The remnants in <span class="gemarra-regular">our </span>cups <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit for chickens. </span>The Gemara objects: If so, the remnants in <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>cups <span class="gemarra-regular">are also fit for chickens. </span>The Gemara rejects this argument: The remnants in <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>cups are <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>from which it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to derive any <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>whatsoever; consequently, they may not be handled at all. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him move </span>what remains of the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">on account of the cup, </span>which is a vessel that may be handled, as the wine remnants should be considered nullified in relation to the cup. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava say: One may move a coal pan [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kannuna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on account of the ashe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that can be used to cover filth, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though there are broken pieces of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wood on it </span>that have no use? This indicates that one may move something that is <span class="it-text">muktze</span> along with something else that one is permitted to handle.
The Gemara rejects this argument: There is a difference between the two cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the broken sticks <span class="gemarra-regular">are not items from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to derive any <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>but are merely <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>what remains of the wine in the gentile’s cup <span class="gemarra-regular">is an item from which </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to derive any <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit, </span>and therefore the prohibition is more stringent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Difti said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina: But let it be like a chamber pot for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feces, </span>which may be removed from a room because it is repulsive. One should likewise be permitted to discard the remnants of these cups, since it is unseemly to leave them on the table. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>If the cups contain such remnants, they may be removed, but may <span class="gemarra-regular">one make a chamber pot for feces </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Sages ruled that one may not invite a gentile for a meal on Shabbat so as to avoid such complications.
In summary of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, the Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">authorized</span> the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Shmuel, </span>from the house of the Exilarch, to deliver a public lecture, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: One may invite a gentile </span>for a meal <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, but one may not invite a gentile </span>for a meal <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a preventive measure, lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>come to cook <span class="gemarra-regular">more for his sake. </span>It is related about <span class="gemarra-regular">Mareimar and Mar Zutr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">when a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gentile would happen </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to their </span>house <span class="gemarra-regular">on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival, they would say to him: If you are satisfie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">that we have prepared for ourselves, good</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and if not, we will not go to </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">extra</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> trouble on your account.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: A person may not heat water </span>on a Festival in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>wash <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">unless it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drinking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they hold that kindling a fire on a Festival is permitted only for the sake of preparing food, but not for washing. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel permit </span>one to kindle a fire on a Festival even for washing. <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may kindle</span> a large <span class="gemarra-regular">fire and warm himself at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire, who taught</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Is <span class="gemarra-regular">it a statement </span>accepted by <span class="gemarra-regular">all, </span>including Beit Shammai, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Shammai differentiate between benefit </span>affecting <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s entire body and benefit </span>affecting <span class="gemarra-regular">a single limb, </span>so that they agree that kindling a fire to heat one’s entire body is similar to kindling a fire for food and is therefore permitted, while heating water to wash one’s feet remains prohibited? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps Beit Hillel taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, but Beit Shammai do not differentiate </span>between the two cases, and they permit kindling a fire on a Festival only for the purpose of preparing food.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from an explicit <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: A person </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not make a fire and warm himself at it, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but Beit Hillel permit </span>it. It is clear from here that the latter clause of the mishna was taught only in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stringent </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">three things in accordance with the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai: One may not insulate hot food on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but rather one ought to do so on the eve of the Festival; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not set up</span> a metal <span class="gemarra-regular">candelabrum </span>that fell <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival; and one may not bake thick </span><span class="gemarra-regular">loave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">but only thin ones, </span>due to the great effort entailed in preparing the former. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel said: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the days of my father’s household they would never</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bake thick loaves </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">thin ones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What shall we do for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your father’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">household</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who were stringent with themselves</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient with all of the Jewish people, to </span>allow them to <span class="gemarra-regular">bake thick loaves and cakes baked on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">coals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that Rabban Gamliel would not permit the insulation of hot water on a Festival <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he prepared a joining of cooked foods [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tavshilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], what is the reason that Beit Shammai </span>prohibit it? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it speaks of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not set aside an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tavshilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason for </span>the lenient ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel? Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Actually, </span>I will <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one did not prepare</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tavshilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but Beit Hillel hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages</span> nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted him </span>to prepare what he needs for <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span> basic <span class="gemarra-regular">sustenance. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rav Huna said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who did not prepare an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tavshilin</span> on the eve of a Festival, others <span class="gemarra-regular">may bake one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> loaf </span>of bread <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, and cook one pot </span>of food <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, </span>

Daf 22a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> kindle a lamp for him. They said in the name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Yitzḥak: They may even roast a small</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fish for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> That is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who did not prepare </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tavshilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">may bake one loaf </span>of bread <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, and insulate one pot </span>of food <span class="gemarra-regular">for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and kindle a lamp for him, and heat one </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">jug [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kiton</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of water <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. And some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: They may even roast a small fish for him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>one can say that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one prepared </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">tavshilin</span>, and nevertheless, if he did not insulate hot food on the eve of the Festival for Shabbat he may not do so on the Festival itself, because <span class="gemarra-regular">insulating </span>hot food <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is evident that he is acting with Shabbat in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mind </span>and not for the Festival. Beit Shammai view this as a desecration of the sanctity of the Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection to</span> Rava’s opinion from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may not bake </span>on a Festival for Shabbat that occurs on the following day <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he established a joining </span>of cooked foods <span class="gemarra-regular">with bread, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may not cook </span>for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he established a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">joining </span>of cooked foods <span class="gemarra-regular">with a cooked dish, and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not insulate </span>hot food for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">had hot food insulated from the eve of the Festival. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this indicates that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he had hot food insulated, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may in any case act </span>in that manner and insulate hot food for Shabbat, even though <span class="gemarra-regular">it is evident </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he is acting with Shabbat in mind. </span>This shows that even according to Ḥananya, who rules in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, it is permitted to insulate hot food on a Festival for Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said </span>that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he established a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> joining </span>of cooked foods <span class="gemarra-regular">for this, </span>meaning he baked and cooked before the Festival for the sake of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not establish a joining </span>of cooked foods <span class="gemarra-regular">for this, </span>i.e., he did not insulate hot food for Shabbat on the Festival eve. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, according to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, </span>with Rabban Gamliel’s household being stringent upon themselves in this regard.
§ The mishna states that one of the three stringencies that Rabban Gamliel practiced in accordance with Beit Shammai was that on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not set up a candelabrum </span>that fell. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>prohibited act <span class="gemarra-regular">does one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>when he sets a candelabrum upright? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥinnana bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Bisna said: Here, we are dealing with a candelabrum </span>composed <span class="gemarra-regular">of segment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that come apart; it is prohibited to reassemble such a candelabrum <span class="gemarra-regular">because it looks like building. As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">building </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to vessels, </span>and therefore the pieces of this candelabrum may not be reconnected, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">building with regard to vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">dismantling with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to vessels. </span>One may therefore reattach the pieces of the candelabrum if they came apart.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">happened to </span>come to <span class="gemarra-regular">the house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda </span>on a Festival. Ulla’s <span class="gemarra-regular">servant stood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and tilted the </span>oil <span class="gemarra-regular">lamp [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheragga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> diverting most of the oil to one side, with the intention of preventing the oil from reaching the wick so that the light would be extinguished more quickly. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda raised an objection</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Ulla </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which it is taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who adds oil to a lam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable for </span>performing the prohibited labor of <span class="gemarra-regular">kindling </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who supplies himself </span>with oil <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a lit lamp on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable for </span>performing the prohibited labor of <span class="gemarra-regular">extinguishing, </span>as he causes the light to be extinguished more quickly. This indicates that any action, even an indirect one, that causes a lamp be extinguished earlier than it would have otherwise is considered extinguishing. Here too, by tilting the lamp, the servant extinguished a light on the Festival, which is prohibited. Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>You are indeed correct; the act was performed by my servant <span class="gemarra-regular">without</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing extinguishing on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: It is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to trim the end of a wic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> that has become charcoal, so that it will burn better; this is not considered extinguishing.
With regard to this same issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba bar Marta raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma before Abaye: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">extinguishing a lamp </span>that is burning in a room on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">for another matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a euphemism for marital relations? Since it is prohibited to have relations in a room where a lamp is burning, may one extinguish a lamp for this purpose? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>One may not extinguish it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is possible </span>to have relations <span class="gemarra-regular">in a different room. </span>
Abba bar Marta continued: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not have a different room, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>should he do? Abaye replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is possible to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">erect for oneself a partition </span>out of sheets and engage in relations on the other side of the partition. Abba bar Marta asked further: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>sheets <span class="gemarra-regular">to erect a partition, what </span>should he do? Abaye answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is possible to invert a vessel over </span>the lamp in order to hide the light. Abba bar Marta further inquired: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not have a vessel, what </span>should he do? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is prohibited; </span>one may not extinguish the lamp.
Abba bar Marta <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Abaye’s opinion from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not extinguish a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">piece of wood in order to save it </span>from being needlessly burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>he extinguishes it <span class="gemarra-regular">so that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house or a pot not become smoky, it is permitted. </span>This shows that it is permitted to extinguish a fire on a Festival if it serves people’s needs. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who permits the performance of prohibited labors on a Festival for all of one’s needs and not only for the preparation of food; <span class="gemarra-regular">when I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spoke, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, </span>who disagree.
Further on the topic of extinguishing, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised a dilemma before Rabba: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to extinguishing a fire on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival? </span>He clarified his question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where there is danger to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">life, I have no dilemma, as </span>in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted even on Shabbat. When I raised the dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it was with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">involving </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> loss. What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">It is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>opinion from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">extinguish a piece of wood in order to save it </span>from being needlessly burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>he extinguishes it <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that the house or a pot not become smoky, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted. </span>This indicates that extinguishing a fire on a Festival is permitted even if only to prevent a small loss. Rabba replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda; when I spoke, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi raised a dilemma before Ameimar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">painting an ey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with a medicinal ointment <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival? </span>He elaborated on his question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where there is a danger </span>to the eye, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the illnesses called <span class="gemarra-italic">rira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ditza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dimata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kadaḥta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or the <span class="gemarra-regular">beginning of an inflammation, I have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no dilemma, as </span>in such cases <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to apply an ointment <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat. When I raised the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma, </span>it was with regard to less serious ailments, such as at the <span class="gemarra-regular">end of an inflammation, or </span>in order to <span class="gemarra-regular">brighten one’s eyesight. What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in such cases? Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to him </span>from the same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not extinguish a piece of wood </span>in order to save it from being needlessly burned, but if he extinguishes it so that the house or a pot not become smoky, it is permitted. This indicates that a prohibited labor is permitted on a Festival, if it is performed for the sake of a bodily need. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">answered him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as we answered </span>before, that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar permitted painting an eye </span>for medicinal purposes <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile. Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar himself painted </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">eye on Shabbat by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What is your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>in permitting this practice? You must rely upon that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, said: All the needs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an ill person </span>whose life is not in danger <span class="gemarra-regular">are performed by means of a gentile on Shabbat. And</span> similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any matter in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which there is no </span>life-threatening <span class="gemarra-regular">dange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> but only potential illness, <span class="gemarra-regular">one says to the gentile </span>to perform the act, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">performs </span>the act for him.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the ill person, or any other Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not assist </span>the gentile. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master, </span>Ameimar, <span class="gemarra-regular">assists </span>the gentile while the ointment is being applied, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he closes and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opens </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">eye, </span>thereby allowing the ointment to penetrate more deeply. Therefore, this should be prohibited. Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ashi: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>also the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds in accordance with your </span>opinion; he, too, raised the objection that it should be prohibited due to the fact that the Jew assists the gentile. <span class="gemarra-regular">And I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">answered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>The assistance provided by one who <span class="gemarra-regular">assists </span>another in performing a task that the other could essentially have performed himself <span class="gemarra-regular">is insubstantial</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Inasmuch as the action is primarily performed by the gentile, the minor assistance given by the Jew may be overlooked.
The Gemara further relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted painting an eye </span>with a medicinal ointment <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> second day of the festival of Rosh HaShana </span>if the eye is causing pain and requires treatment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Ameimar: But didn’t Rava say </span>that if a person <span class="gemarra-regular">died on the first day of a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, gentiles may attend to his </span>burial; if he died <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the second day of a Festival </span>observed in the Diaspora, <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews may attend to his </span>burial? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even on the second day of the festival of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rosh HaShana, </span>

Daf 22b

<span class="gemarra-regular">which is not so with regard to an egg. </span>With regard to an egg laid on a Festival, the two days of Rosh HaShana are considered one long day and a single period of sanctity. It was only in deference to the dead that the Sages were lenient with regard to burial on the second day of Rosh HaShana, but with regard to all other matters, the two days of Rosh HaShana are viewed as one day and are governed by the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
Ameimar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: I hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a, who state </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to an egg </span>laid on the Festival and other matters, as there is no difference between the two days of Rosh HaShana and the two days of other Festivals. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is your reasoning </span>that you are concerned? Is it that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps they will extend </span>the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Elul</span> and declare it a thirty-day month, which would mean that the second day of the Festival is the first of Tishrei, the true date of Rosh HaShana? But <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t Rav Ḥinnana bar Kahana say: From the days of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ezra and onward we have not found </span>that the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Elul </span>was made <span class="gemarra-regular">a full, </span>thirty-day month, and therefore there is no cause for this concern.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not bake thick loaves </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">but only thin ones. The Sages taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not bake </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thick bread on Passover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it might become leavened before it has a chance to bake, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas Beit Hillel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permit </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>thickness renders a loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">thick </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span>that is permitted by Beit Hillel? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>It is up to a thickness of one <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we find likewise with regard to the shewbread </span>in the Temple, which must also be unleavened and which was one <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth </span>thick. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef strongly objects to this </span>argument of Rav Huna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>this leniency <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> the shewbread that is prepared by priests, who are <span class="gemarra-regular">vigilant</span> about the mitzvot and ensure that the dough is not leavened, would <span class="gemarra-regular">they say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>bread that is prepared by ordinary people, who are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">vigilant? </span>Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> the shewbread, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">well-kneaded [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread, </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">they say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to bread that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">well kneaded?</span>
Rav Yosef continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">If they stated </span>this leniency <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dry wood, </span>which was used in the Temple, as it would burn well and bake the bread quickly, would <span class="gemarra-regular">they say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">moist wood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is what most people use to heat their ovens? Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hot oven </span>found in the Temple, would <span class="gemarra-regular">they say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a standard <span class="gemarra-regular">oven, </span>which is typically <span class="gemarra-regular">cold </span>in comparison to that of the Temple? And lastly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the Temple’s <span class="gemarra-regular">metal oven, </span>which warms up quickly, would <span class="gemarra-regular">they say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">earthenware oven </span>that most people use to bake their bread?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said: I asked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my teacher in private, and who is </span>this teacher? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav. </span>Rav Yirmeya asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">thick bread? </span>Rav explained that it means <span class="gemarra-regular">a large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quantity </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a large amount of dough prepared in a single session. The concern here is not that the bread might become leavened, but that its preparation involves unnecessary exertion on the Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: I asked</span> this of <span class="gemarra-regular">my teacher in private; and who is </span>Rav’s teacher? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">our holy Rabb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> Yehuda HaNasi. And he explained the matter as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">thick bread? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">a large quantity </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">bread. And why do they call it thick bread? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is </span>greatly <span class="gemarra-regular">expanded at the </span>time of <span class="gemarra-regular">kneading </span>and therefore looks very thick. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, in the place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna lived, <span class="gemarra-regular">a large quantity</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">bread was called thick bread.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since </span>the prohibition here is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he exerts himself unnecessarily</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>did the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>with respect to <span class="gemarra-regular">Passover? </span>The same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should apply <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to the other Festivals as well. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, it is indeed so; </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not limited to Passover. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who taught this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was dealing </span>at the time <span class="gemarra-regular">with the festival </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Passover</span> and therefore mentioned this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in relation to that Festival, even though it applies in equal fashion to the other Festivals. The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may not bake a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large quantity of bread on </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival, whereas Beit Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permit </span>it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">also said three things as leniencies, </span>in opposition to the view of most of the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may sweep the room of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">couche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on a Festival, i.e., the dining room, where they would recline on couches to eat, as there is no concern that by sweeping the room one might come to fill in the holes and level the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>consisting of fragrant herbs on burning coals in order to perfume one’s house <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. And one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may prepare a whole kid </span>goat, meaning a kid goat roasted whole, with its entrails over its head, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> night of Passover, </span>as was the custom when they roasted the Paschal lamb in the Temple. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit </span>all three practices: It is prohibited to sweep lest one come to level the ground, it is prohibited to burn incense because it does not meet the criteria of permitted food preparation, and it is prohibited to eat a kid that was roasted whole on the night of Passover because it would appear as if he were eating consecrated food outside the Temple.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>with regard to incense applies only to a case where one wishes to burn the incense in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to perfume </span>his garments. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if he burns the incense in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>enjoy the <span class="gemarra-regular">smell, all agree </span>that this is like other bodily pleasures, the satisfaction of which has the same status as food preparation, and it is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against Rav Asi’s understanding of the mishna from the following <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not sweep the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> room of the couches on a Festival </span>lest he fill in holes and level the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabban Gamliel they did sweep, </span>as they did not share this concern. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzado</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: On </span><span class="gemarra-regular">many occasions I followed Father, </span>Rabbi Tzadok, <span class="gemarra-regular">into Rabban Gamliel’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s house, and </span>I observed that <span class="gemarra-regular">they would not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">sweep the room of the couches on a Festival, but </span>rather they would do the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">sweep </span>the room <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of the Festival and spread sheets </span><span class="gemarra-regular">over it </span>so that it would not become dirty, and <span class="gemarra-regular">on the following day, when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">guests entered, they removed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sheets, and it turned out that the house was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cleaned on its own. </span>The other Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If so, it is permitted to do so on Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>and there is no dispute in that case. 
The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> continues: Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not place incense </span>on burning coals <span class="gemarra-regular">on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival, but </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the house of Rabban Gamliel they did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>incense. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer bar Tzadok said: On many occasions </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I followed Father into Rabban Gamliel’s house, and </span>I noticed that <span class="gemarra-regular">they would not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">place incense </span>on burning coals <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, but </span>rather they would <span class="gemarra-regular">bring perforated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">coal pans [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ardaska’ot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> made of iron, filled them with </span>fragrant <span class="gemarra-regular">smoke on the eve of the Festival, and plugged </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their holes on the Festival eve </span>so that their fragrant smell would not escape. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the following day, when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">guests entered, they opened the holes, </span>releasing the smell throughout the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it turned out that the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was perfumed on its own.</span>
The other Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If so, it is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to do so on Shabbat as well. </span>This shows that the issue was not the perfuming of clothes but rather the burning of incense for the smell in the house. It follows that the Sages prohibit the practice even when the incense is burned for the enjoyment of the smell, against the opinion of Rav Asi.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Gemara retracts its previous statement and says that <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this was stated, it was stated as follows: Rav Asi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>with regard to incense applies only to a case where one burns the incense in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>enjoy the <span class="gemarra-regular">smell. However, </span>if he burns the incense in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to perfume </span>his garments, all agree that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">smokin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> fruit on a Festival with incense in order to enhance its aroma? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>as it is not included in the category of permitted food preparation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: It is permitted. Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna said: It is prohibited because he extinguishes </span>some of the coals when he sprinkles the aromatic powder on them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to him: And let the Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">because he kindles </span>the coals, as afterward the fragrant spices cause the coals to burn even more strongly; why are you not concerned about this? Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Two prohibitions are indeed violated: <span class="gemarra-regular">Its beginning </span>involves <span class="gemarra-regular">extinguishing, and its end </span>involves <span class="gemarra-regular">kindling.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>Sprinkling the aromatic spices <span class="gemarra-regular">on the coals </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for the aforementioned reasons. 

Daf 23a

However, placing them <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>a scalding fragment of <span class="gemarra-regular">earthenwar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted, </span>as there is no concern of extinguishing or kindling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba said: </span>Placing the spices <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>a hot piece of <span class="gemarra-regular">earthenware is also prohibited, because it produces</span> a new <span class="gemarra-regular">scent</span> in the earthenware, and one may not create new things on a Festival. The Gemara notes that similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef both said </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is prohibited to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> overturn a cup </span>containing perfume <span class="gemarra-regular">onto silk garments on a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival. What is the reason </span>for this prohibition? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it produces </span>a new <span class="gemarra-regular">scent </span>in the garment.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>the case discussed in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may press </span>a piece of aromatic wood between his fingers <span class="gemarra-regular">and smell it, and one may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">snip off </span>a piece of it in order to release its fragrance <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> smell it? </span>In those cases too he produces a scent. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, the scent exists in any case</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">adds to the fragrance, </span>as his pressing or snipping causes the smell to be stronger. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>on the other hand, where he overturns a cup of perfume on clothing, <span class="gemarra-regular">he produces </span>a new <span class="gemarra-regular">scent. Rava, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">even permitted </span>to sprinkle the aromatic spices <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is </span>permitted to place <span class="gemarra-regular">meat on coals </span>for roasting.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Geviha from Bei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Katil </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">taught at the entrance to the house of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Exilarch </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">ketura</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted </span>on a Festival; but he did not add any further clarification. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">ketura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">tying </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">ketura</span>] ornamental knots <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this is the <span class="gemarra-regular">act of a craftsman </span>and is therefore certainly prohibited on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to burning </span>incense [<span class="it-text">ketoret</span>], this too is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, as he extinguishes </span>some of the coals when he sprinkles the aromatic powder on them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to him: Actually, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to burning </span>incense, which is permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is </span>permitted to place <span class="gemarra-regular">meat on coals </span>for roasting.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a slightly different version of this story, in which <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>Rav Geviha: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">ketura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">tying </span>ornamental knots <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the act of a craftsman, </span>which is prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to burning </span>incense, this too is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he produces a </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">scent. Rav Ashi said: I said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to Rav Geviha, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I said </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of a great man, </span>Rava, that <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to burning </span>incense, which is permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>permitted to place <span class="gemarra-regular">meat on coals </span>for roasting. 
§ It is taught in the mishna that one of Rabban Gamliel’s three leniencies was that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may prepare a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whole [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mekulas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> goat, meaning a goat roasted whole, with its entrails over its head, on the night of Passover. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in this regard that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Theodosius [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Todos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rome, </span>leader of the Jewish community there, <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted the custom for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Roman </span>Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat whole kids on the night of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Passover, </span>in commemoration of the practice followed in the Temple. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>a message <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: Were you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not Theodosius</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an important person, <span class="gemarra-regular">we would have decreed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ostracism upon you, as you are feeding the Jewish people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>food, which may be eaten only in and around the Temple itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the Temple. 
The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can it enter your mind </span>that the Sages really meant that Theodosius was feeding the Jewish people <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>food outside the Temple? These goats are certainly not consecrated animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that he was feeding the Jewish people something <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to consecrated </span>food, which people might mistake for a Paschal offering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <span class="gemarra-regular">three things </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Azary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">permits and the Rabbis prohibit: His cow </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">go</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a decorative <span class="gemarra-regular">stra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">between its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> horns. </span>Rabbi Elazar holds that such a strap is considered an ornament for the cow rather than a burden, whereas the Sages view it as a burden.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may comb [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mekardin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> with a fine comb <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival </span>in order to remove ticks and dirt from its hair; the Rabbis prohibit this due to a concern that he might thereby come to wound or bruise the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may grind peppe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> needed on the Festival even <span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">mill, </span>although this appears similar to a weekday labor.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One may not comb an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span>to remove ticks and dirt from its hair <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival because </span>this certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">creates a wound, but one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may brush </span>it with a wooden comb, as its blunt teeth do not wound the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One may not comb, nor may one even brush.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s cow would go out on Shabbat with a strap between its horns, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya had </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one cow? But didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t Rav say, and some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from his herds thirteen thousand calves each and every year, </span>which means that he had ten times that number of calves alone. Why, then, does the mishna speak of his cow? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: This cow <span class="gemarra-regular">was not his; rather, it was his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> neighbor’s. And because he did not protest her </span>conduct and tell her that it is prohibited to do so, the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">was called by his name </span>to his discredit, as if it were his. 
§ It is taught in the mishna that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may comb an animal on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">combing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and what is brushing? Combing </span>is performed with <span class="gemarra-regular">a small</span>-toothed comb <span class="gemarra-regular">and makes a wound; brushing </span>is done with <span class="gemarra-regular">a large</span>-toothed comb <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not make a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wound.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there are three disputes with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter. Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an unintentional act, </span>a permitted action from which an unintended prohibited labor ensues on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, </span>as in his opinion it is prohibited to perform an action that involves a prohibited labor on Shabbat even if one has a permitted action in mind and does not intend to perform the labor in question. Therefore, one may not comb an animal in a manner that will cause a wound, even unintentionally. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>he differentiates between the cases: Although he prohibits <span class="gemarra-regular">combing </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> small</span>-toothed comb that <span class="gemarra-regular">makes a wound, </span>he permits <span class="gemarra-regular">brushing</span> with <span class="gemarra-regular">a large</span>-toothed comb that <span class="gemarra-regular">does not make a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wound, and we do not issue a decree </span>and prohibit <span class="gemarra-regular">brushing due to combing, </span>as there is no concern that people will err and come to permit even combing in the prohibited manner. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda </span>with regard to the fundamental issue that <span class="gemarra-regular">an unintentional act is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited. </span>However, they maintain that <span class="gemarra-regular">we issue a decree </span>and prohibit <span class="gemarra-regular">brushing due to combing. </span>On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds in accordance with </span>the dissenting opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an unintentional act </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">both combing and brushing are permitted, </span>as even if the combing or brushing bruises the animal, there is no transgression of a prohibition, as there was certainly no intention to cause the animal a wound. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said, and some</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>this teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">himself: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that an unintentional act is permitted on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya agrees with him. Rava said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman: And let the Master say </span>the opposite, that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, as the Rabbis agree with him. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Fundamentally <span class="gemarra-regular">I hold in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon; </span>I am merely adding <span class="gemarra-regular">another</span> reason for doing so, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Elazar ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Azarya agrees with him. </span>

Daf 23b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>aforementioned <span class="gemarra-regular">pepper mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> is a composite vessel, and each of its parts must be considered independently with respect to ritual impurity. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is susceptible to ritual impurity because of </span>each of the <span class="gemarra-regular">three vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of which it is comprised: It is susceptible to impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is a wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">receptacle, </span>it is susceptible to impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a metal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it is susceptible to impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a sieve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>section of the mill is susceptible to impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is viewed as <span class="gemarra-regular">a receptacle, </span>since the ground pepper descends into it. <span class="gemarra-regular">The middle </span>section is susceptible to impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a sieve, </span>as it serves to filter the pepper. Finally, the <span class="gemarra-regular">upper </span>part, in which the pepper is actually ground, is susceptible to impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a metal vessel. </span>Although it is not a receptacle, it is nevertheless susceptible to impurity, since it is made of metal.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A child’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wagon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with which he plays and upon which he also sits, <span class="gemarra-regular">is susceptible to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity </span>imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">treading</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is considered a fixed seat of the child, so that if the child is a <span class="it-text">zav</span> and he sits on the wagon, it contracts the ritual impurity imparted by the treading of a <span class="it-text">zav</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this wagon <span class="gemarra-regular">may be handled on Shabbat, </span>as it is considered a vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it may be dragged </span>on the ground on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only upon cloth, </span>a stone pavement, or the like, as otherwise it would create a furrow when dragged, and one would be liable due to the prohibited labor of plowing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: </span>For this reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">no vessels may be dragged </span>on the ground on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a wagon, </span>which is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>its wheels do not make a furrow in the ground but merely <span class="gemarra-regular">press </span>the earth down. Since no earth is moved from its place, this is not considered digging or plowing on Shabbat. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> child’s wagon is susceptible to ritual impurity </span>imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">treading. </span>Why? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he leans on it. </span>The mishna also teaches that this wagon <span class="gemarra-regular">may be handled on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat. </span>Why? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it has the status of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a vessel, </span>and one may handle a vessel on Shabbat. 
The mishna further teaches that a child’s wagon <span class="gemarra-regular">may be dragged </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only upon cloth. </span>The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon cloth, yes, </span>it is permitted; but directly <span class="gemarra-regular">on the ground, no, </span>it is not permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he creates a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furrow</span> in the ground when he drags the wagon across it. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: An unintentional act, </span>i.e., a permitted action from which an unintended prohibited labor ensues on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>even though the person performing it does not have the prohibited labor in mind.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he say: An unintentional act is permitted, </span>since there was no intention to perform the prohibited action? <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned</span> explicitly in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: A person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may drag a bed, a chair, or a bench </span>on the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not intend to make</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a furrow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Even if one forms a furrow unwittingly, he need one need not be concerned, as this was not his intention.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: No vessels may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be dragged </span>on the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat except for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wagon, because it </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">presses </span>the earth down. This is not prohibited as plowing because it does not create a furrow. This indicates that a wagon may be dragged on the ground on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">because, yes, it presses </span>the earth down, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it does not make a furrow. </span>Since it has already been established that the first section of the mishna is also in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, and there it appears that a wagon dragged along the ground makes a furrow, Rabbi Yehuda seems to contradict himself. 
The Gemara answers: It must be explained that this is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> who hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>but differ with regard to the content of that opinion. The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that even a wagon makes a furrow, whereas the other <span class="it-text">tanna</span> maintains in the name of Rabbi Yehuda that a wagon does not make a furrow.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">pond</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival </span>even with the intention of eating them, as this falls into the category of hunting, a type of labor that is not permitted on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor may one place food before them, </span>as it is not his duty to feed them; rather, they maintain themselves by eating smaller fish or different types of algae that grow in the water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may trap an animal or a bird from </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosures</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beivarim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they are viewed as already captured, and therefore the action is not considered an act of hunting. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">place food before the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> as one does for other household animals.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enclosures are identical </span>with respect to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of hunting. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>animal

Daf 24a

inside such an enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">whose trapping is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inadequate, </span>meaning that the enclosure is large and contains hiding places so that it is still necessary to pursue and apprehend the animal, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for one to catch it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>with regard to any animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose trapping is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not inadequate, </span>as it is possible to seize it immediately without having to engage in further pursuit, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for one to catch it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from what is stated in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From enclosures of animals and of birds, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not trap </span>animals or birds <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may one place food before them. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>due to a contradiction between the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span>in the mishna and the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>. This is similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>due to a contradiction between the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">birds </span>in the mishna and the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">birds </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>.
The Gemara resolves the first contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>with regard to the contradiction between the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>in the mishna and the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that prohibits trapping and feeding animals in the enclosures, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that an animal trapped in an enclosure whose trapping is inadequate, i.e., it is still necessary to pursue and apprehend the animal, is not considered trapped, and therefore one may not trap it from the enclosure on a Festival. Whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>the mishna that permits trapping and feeding the animals in the enclosures, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who maintain that an animal in an enclosure is considered trapped, and therefore removing it from there is not considered an act of hunting.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One who </span>drives and <span class="gemarra-regular">traps</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bird into a closet or a deer into a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house is liable. </span>The Gemara infers from this: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span> only if he traps the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">into a house that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is liable, but </span>if he traps it <span class="gemarra-regular">into an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enclosure, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>One is liable for trapping <span class="gemarra-regular">a bird into a closet, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for trapping <span class="gemarra-regular">a deer into a garden, or into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, or into an enclosure. </span>This demonstrates that according to the Rabbis, an animal found inside an enclosure is regarded as already captured, whereas Rabbi Yehuda disagrees. From this it follows that Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis similarly disagree about catching an animal inside an enclosure and removing it from there on a Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>concerning the contradiction between the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">birds </span>in the mishna and the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">birds </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as all agree that they may not be caught, even in one’s house. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>contradiction is <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the mishna that permits trapping, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a roofed enclosure, </span>in which a bird is considered captured, and therefore there is no prohibition against apprehending it on a Festival, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that prohibits trapping, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an unroofe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enclosure, </span>in which a bird is not considered trapped and apprehending it is prohibited, that does not resolve the contradiction. 
The Gemara explains why the proposed resolution must be rejected: <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, which is like a roofed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enclosure, </span>there is no dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to both Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda and the Rabbis, a bird </span>trapped <span class="gemarra-regular">into a closet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, yes, </span>it is considered trapped, while a bird <span class="gemarra-regular">into a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house, no, </span>it is not considered trapped. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Here, </span>in the mishna, according to which a bird in a house is not considered trapped, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with a free</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bird, </span>a sparrow, <span class="gemarra-regular">which does not accept authority. </span>That bird is not intimidated and evades capture even in a house. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Why is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> called a free </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">dror</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">bird</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because it dwells</span> [<span class="gemarra-italic">dara</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">in a house as it does in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">field, </span>flittering from place to place. For this reason, it is not considered captured when it is inside a house. Therefore, the distinction between a roofed and an unroofed enclosure resolves the apparent contradiction between the mishna and the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that you have arrived at this </span>understanding, that the difference between the rulings in the two sources is predicated on different circumstances and not on a tannaitic dispute, the apparent contradiction between the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>in the mishna and the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">also not difficult. This, </span>the ruling in the mishna that permits apprehending the animal, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a small enclosure, </span>in which the animal cannot evade its pursuers and requires no further trapping. <span class="gemarra-regular">That, </span>the ruling in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that prohibits apprehending the animal, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a large enclosure, </span>from which the animal cannot escape, but it can still avoid being caught.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a small enclosure, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a large enclosure? Rav Ashi said: Any </span>enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">where one can run after </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and reach it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in one stoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a small enclosure. And </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a large enclosure. Or perhaps, any </span>enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has a series of corners </span>in which the animal could hide and evade capture is <span class="gemarra-regular">a large enclosure, and </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a small enclosure. Or perhaps, any </span>enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the shadows from the </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">walls fall upon each other, </span>because the walls are close together, is <span class="gemarra-regular">a small enclosure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">other, </span>a larger area where the walls are further apart, is <span class="gemarra-regular">a large enclosure.</span>
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Gamliel says: Not all enclosures are identical. </span>If the animal is inadequately trapped in the enclosure, it is prohibited for one to catch it; whereas if it is adequately trapped, he is permitted to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel. Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: If one rules that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with his opinion, does that mean <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>that the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or perhaps there is no dispute and everyone accepts the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And what difference is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there to you </span>whether or not the Rabbis disagree? In either case the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Why then does it matter whether or not the issue was in dispute? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him, </span>invoking a folk expression with regard to one who learns without reaching understanding: Is it simply <span class="gemarra-regular">learn the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lesson; </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">it be </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">a song</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In other words, is it sufficient to simply parrot the halakhic ruling? Rather, it is necessary to examine the issue to understand it even if it does not yield a practical halakhic difference. 
It was further taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: Any </span>animal inside such an enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">whose trapping is inadequate </span>may not be caught and removed from there on a Festival, whereas any animal whose trapping is not inadequate may be apprehended and removed from there. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose trapping is inadequate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Any </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to which one would say: Bring a trap so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that we may catch it, </span>as the animal cannot be apprehended without the aid of a trap.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But aren’t geese and chickens</span> that are loose in a courtyard creatures <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which one would say: Bring a trap so that we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may catch it, </span>as they freely roam about and evade capture? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who traps geese, chickens, or domestic dove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they are considered already trapped.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>There is a difference between the two cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">These, </span>the geese and chickens, <span class="gemarra-regular">enter their coop in the evening </span>and use it as their fixed dwelling place and are therefore considered trapped, <span class="gemarra-regular">while these </span>animals in the enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">do not enter their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coop in the evening </span>and therefore flee from those trying to seize them.
The Gemara challenges this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t doves of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dovecote and doves of a loft enter their coop in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the evening, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who traps doves of a dovecote, doves of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> loft, or birds that are nesting in pitcher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">buildings is liable </span>for their capture, although they enter their coop in the evening? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>A distinction can be made as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">These, </span>the geese and chickens, <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their coop in the evening, and </span>providing them with <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feed is your </span>responsibility. They are therefore accustomed to their owners and considered as trapped. <span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas these, </span>the doves of a dovecote and the other birds mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, admittedly <span class="gemarra-regular">enter their coop in the evening, but feeding them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not your </span>responsibility. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari said </span>an alternative distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">These, </span>the doves of a dovecote, <span class="gemarra-regular">are likely </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to flee </span>from people, and therefore require trapping, <span class="gemarra-regular">while these, </span>the geese, chickens, and domestic doves, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not likely to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flee </span>from them. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of them are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also likely to flee </span>when being pursued, even chickens. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are likely</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to flee to their coop. </span>In other words, even when they reach their coop they do not remain still but continue in their attempts to escape, and are therefore not considered trapped. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">traps for animals, birds, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">were set on the eve of a Festival, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not take </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">from them on the Festival, unless</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he knows that </span>the animals found in the traps <span class="gemarra-regular">had</span> already <span class="gemarra-regular">been caught on the eve of the Festival. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an incident </span>is related <span class="gemarra-regular">where a certain gentile brought fish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rabban Gamliel, and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The fish <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted, but I do not wish to accept </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as I despise him.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a question about the story involving Rabban Gamliel. Was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>cited above <span class="gemarra-regular">to contradict </span>a previously stated <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The mishna first teaches that one may not eat an animal caught on a Festival, and then relates an incident in which Rabban Gamliel ruled that this is permitted. The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete; </span>it is missing an important element, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it teaches the following: </span>Even in a case where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>whether or not the animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>before the Festival, as it is unclear whether it was caught today or on the previous day, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabban Gamliel permits </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And an incident </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>related <span class="gemarra-regular">where a certain gentile brought fish to Rabban Gamliel, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The fish <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted, but I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not wish to accept </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from him. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel. Some teach this </span>halakhic ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught: </span>With regard to something about which <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>exists whether or not it was <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>before the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel permits </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua prohibits </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua. And </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">teach it in reference to this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught: </span>

Daf 24b

<span class="gemarra-regular">One may slaughter </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>pens containing <span class="gemarra-regular">pool</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of drinking water <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, but not from </span>those found caught in <span class="gemarra-regular">nets or </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">traps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they may have been caught on the Festival itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he came and found </span>the nets and traps <span class="gemarra-regular">out of order on the eve of the Festival, </span>which indicates that an animal had been caught in them, then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is known that </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">were caught on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the eve of the Festival, and they are </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>However, if he checked the nets and traps shortly before the onset of the Festival and found them intact, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">came and found them out of order on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is known that </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> caught on the Festival, and they are </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited.</span>
The Gemara poses a question: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>because it contains an internal contradiction between its clauses: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he came and found them out of order</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the eve of the Festival, it is known that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they were caught on the eve of the Festival. The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he came and found them out of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> order, but </span>if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of that same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he came and found them out of order</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the Festival, it is known that they were caught</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the Festival. The reason </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he came and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> found them out of order, but </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, </span>the assumption is that <span class="gemarra-regular">they were caught on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eve of the Festival and are permitted. </span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: If he came and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found them out of order on the eve of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival, it is known that they were caught on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve of the Festival, and they are permitted. But </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, it is considered as if they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were caught on the Festival, and they are prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. </span>All these versions of Shmuel’s ruling are basically in agreement: In a case of uncertainty as to whether or not an item was prepared before the Festival, it is prohibited. 
§ It was stated in the mishna that Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the fish brought to him on the Festival by the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for wha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> purpose? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: They are permitted to be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> received </span>and moved, but they may not be eaten. <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi said: They are </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to be eaten. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person should never prevent himself from </span>attending <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for even one moment, </span>and the proof is from this issue; <span class="gemarra-regular">as Levi and I were before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">when he stated this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. In the evening he said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They are permitted to be eaten, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">morning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he said: They are permitted </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to be received. I, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who was in the study hall </span>in the morning as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted </span>what I said, and taught the matter in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s second opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was not in the study hall </span>in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not retract </span>his statement.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile brought a gift [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">doron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">even moist [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mefulamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or produce from that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day, they are permitted. Granted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, according to the one who said they are permitted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be received, it is well; </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is understandable. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, according to the one who said they are permitted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be eaten, is produce from that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day permitted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be eaten? </span>If it was picked from the tree on that day, it is subject to the prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. 
The Gemara responds with a counter-question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, is produce </span>picked <span class="gemarra-regular">on that</span> same <span class="gemarra-regular">day permitted to be moved? </span>Why, then, is it obvious to you that the produce is permitted to be received? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be explained that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with fish whose </span>gills <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">re</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">produce that is preserved in greens, </span>not with produce that was actually picked on that day. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">called </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day? Because it is </span>fresh and <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>produce picked <span class="gemarra-regular">on that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day. </span>Such produce is permitted not only to be moved, but even to be eaten. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in this regard <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>as follows: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile who brought a gift to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Je</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if there is of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that species </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>to a tree or the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>to be eaten, as it may be assumed that the gentile picked it that same day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in the evening as well, </span>after the conclusion of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited for </span>the period of <span class="gemarra-regular">time</span> needed <span class="gemarra-regular">for its preparation, </span>i.e., the period of time necessary to detach it from the tree or the ground, as one may not derive benefit from a prohibited labor that was performed on a Festival on behalf of a Jew. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if none</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of that species is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>to the ground, then if the gift was brought from <span class="gemarra-regular">within the limit,</span> i.e., the distance one may travel on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted, </span>as no prohibited labor has been performed. 

Daf 25a

If, however, the gift was brought from <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the limit, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited. And </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">that came </span>from outside the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">for one Jew is permitted to another Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> No prohibition applies to the second recipient, as the gentile’s intention was not fulfilled. Since the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of limits is a rabbinic prohibition, the Sages decreed that the object is prohibited only to the one on behalf of whom it was brought, but not to others. 
§ The Gemara continues its discussion about trapping animals on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one dammed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a water channe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that was used to irrigate a field <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of a Festival, and the following day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he arose and found fish in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted. </span>These fish presumably arrived with the water before the Festival and were unable to escape, as the channel had been obstructed. Therefore, the fish are considered as having been prepared before the Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: From </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of our teacher, </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an undomesticated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal that nested in an orchard </span>near one’s house <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require </span>special <span class="gemarra-regular">designation </span>but is considered prepared. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman said </span>in response to this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Our colleague, </span>Rav Ḥisda, <span class="gemarra-regular">has fallen upon a great </span>matter, i.e., an issue that is not at all straightforward but is the subject of various disagreements. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a slightly different version of this statement, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said: From</span> this <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of our teacher, </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">require </span>special <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>and with regard to this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman said </span>that Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">son of our colleague, </span>Rav Huna, <span class="gemarra-regular">has fallen upon a great </span>matter. Rav Huna was a contemporary of Rav Naḥman’s, and they were both students of Rav; consequently, Rav Naḥman referred to Rav Huna as his colleague and called Rabba the son of his colleague.
Rav Naḥman explains the difference between the cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case where the undomesticated animal nested in an orchard, the person <span class="gemarra-regular">performed no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">action </span>at all, as the animal came of its own accord, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case where he dammed the water channel, <span class="gemarra-regular">he performed an action </span>when he blocked the water from leaving the channel. 
Rav Naḥman concludes his challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">not require </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">designation? Isn’t it taugh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard requires designation. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">a free bird</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one is required </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to tie its wings so that it will not be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mistaken for its mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., so that he not take a different bird, such as its mother, in its place. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a testimony that was reported </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Shemaya and Avtalyon. </span>The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the Sages who drew an inference from Rav’s statement.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>an undomesticated animal in an orchard really <span class="gemarra-regular">require designation? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel concede </span>with regard to doves and the like <span class="gemarra-regular">that one had designated </span>on the eve of a Festival when they were <span class="gemarra-regular">inside the nest, and </span>on the Festival itself <span class="gemarra-regular">he found </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in front of the nest, that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited, </span>as these doves might not be the same ones that he had designated but rather others that came from somewhere else? <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to doves of a dovecote, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doves of a loft</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and birds nesting in pitchers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or in a building. However, geese, chicken, domestic doves, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard are permitted </span>in all cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they do not require designation </span>in advance. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a free bird, one is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">required to tie its wings so that it is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mistaken for its mother.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>birds <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>wings <span class="gemarra-regular">were tied </span>as a sign, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">those that were shaken </span>in advance in order to designate them for the Festival, if they were <span class="gemarra-regular">in cisterns, in houses, in trenches, or in caves, they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted </span>on the Festival. However, if they were <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trees, they are prohibited, lest one climb up </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">and detach </span>something from it, which is prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">And those </span>birds <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>wings <span class="gemarra-regular">were tied </span>by another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that were shake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> by another <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited in all places</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>even not on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">stealing. </span>Tying or shaking is considered an act of acquisition, and therefore others may not take them. In any case, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> clearly states that an undomesticated animal that nested in an orchard does not require designation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which teaches that an animal nesting in an orchard is permitted even without designation, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to it, </span>a young animal that cannot escape; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that designation is required, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to its mother, </span>which is larger and can escape. The Gemara asks: But is mere <span class="gemarra-regular">designation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient for its mother? </span>Doesn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">it require complete capture, </span>as it is an undomesticated animal? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to it, </span>a young animal that is unable to escape, and the difference between them is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which does not require designation, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a garden </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">near </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the city, </span>so that one knows precisely where the animal is located and he can take it at any time. <span class="gemarra-regular">T</span><span class="gemarra-regular">hat </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which requires designation, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garden that is not </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">nearby. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in dange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of dying, in which case its meat would be prohibited as the animal had not been properly slaughtered, and one wishes to slaughter it in the hope that it will be found fit for eating and he will be spared a loss, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not slaughter </span>it on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">time in the day </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an olive-bulk of roasted mea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the animal, so that it is possible to say that he slaughtered the animal for the sake of the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>There need not be enough time for him to roast it; rather, it is sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if there is only time to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk of raw </span>meat <span class="gemarra-regular">from the place where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is slaughtered, </span>i.e., from its neck, without going to the trouble of removing its hide and roasting it.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one slaughtered </span>an animal on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">in the field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not bring it </span>to his house <span class="gemarra-regular">on a pol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a set of poles </span>carried by two people, as this appears similar to a weekday activity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he must alter his usual weekday manner of performing this action <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bring </span>it in <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand, limb by limb. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Abba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">flaying and cutting </span>the animal into pieces is mentioned in the Torah with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same is true for butchers. </span>That is to say, we learn from the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the burnt offering that a butcher should first remove the hide and cut the animal into pieces. <span class="gemarra-regular">From here the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah taught </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">etiquette</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person should not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat meat before flaying and cutting </span>the animal into pieces. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>new <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>Rami bar Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? If we say </span>that he wishes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude</span> the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, </span>there is a difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna said: An animal, while alive, retains its presumptive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> status of </span>being subject to the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>against eating a limb from a living creature, and it retains that status after slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">until it becomes known to you how it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was slaughtered. </span>As long as it has not yet been clarified that the animal was slaughtered properly, it is presumed to be prohibited. 
However, once the animal has been <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>properly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it retains its presumptive status</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of being permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until it becomes known to you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">how it became a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>an animal suffering from a wound or illness that would cause it to die within twelve months, which is prohibited to be eaten even after ritual slaughter. There is no need to conduct a special examination of the animal to determine if it had a defect or illness, as it is presumed to be permitted. Even if a defect is found, this does not necessarily render the animal a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>, as one can say that it appeared only after the animal was slaughtered. 
One might have understood from Rami bar Abba’s statement that he disagrees with Rav Huna and requires that the animal be examined. However, this is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t we learn </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna? As we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: </span>It is sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if there is only time to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">olive-bulk of raw </span>meat <span class="gemarra-regular">from the place where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is slaughtered. What, is it not </span>referring to meat <span class="gemarra-regular">from the actual place where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is slaughtered, </span>from which it follows that one need not remove the hide or examine the animal?
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the mishna can be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the place where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters its food, </span>i.e., from its intestines, where digestion takes place. The hide must still be removed and the animal must be examined before it can be eaten. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the actual place where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is slaughtered? Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects the previous explanation and says that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abba</span>

Daf 25b

merely <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span> proper <span class="gemarra-regular">etiquette, </span>even though no prohibition is involved.
§ The Sages teach proper manners unconnected to any prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not ea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garlic or onions </span>from the side of <span class="gemarra-regular">its head, </span>i.e., its roots, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the side of <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if he did eat </span>in that manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>gives the appearance of being <span class="gemarra-regular">a glutton. Similarly, a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not drink his cup </span>of wine all <span class="gemarra-regular">at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once, and if he did drink </span>in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> gives the appearance of being <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>greedy <span class="gemarra-regular">drinker. The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in this regard: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who drinks his cup </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">at once is a </span>greedy <span class="gemarra-regular">drinker; </span>if he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">in two </span>swallows, this is proper <span class="gemarra-regular">etiquette; </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>swallows, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">of haughty spirit, </span>as he presents himself as overly delicate and refined.
Apropos the previous discussion, the Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Abba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sea squill</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a plant from the lily family whose roots project deep into the ground, will <span class="gemarra-regular">cut of</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the feet of the wicked </span>in the future on the Day of Judgment. It was customary to plant sea squill on the edges of fields as boundary markers because their roots grow straight down without spreading out. Those who overstepped boundaries and infringed upon their neighbor’s property should have heeded the markers and desisted. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">young tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will cut</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> off the feet of butcher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and those who have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">relations with menstruating women. </span>After a tree is planted, one must wait three years before eating its fruit. This should serve as a lesson for those butchers who hasten to eat of the animal’s meat before removing its hide, and for those who have relations with their menstruating wives and do not wait for them to achieve ritual purification. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The lupine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">turmus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an extremely bitter legume that is edible only after an extensive process, <span class="gemarra-regular">will cut of</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the feet of the enemies of the Jewish people, </span>a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And the children of Israel continued to do evil in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the eyes of the Lord, and served the Baalim and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram and the gods</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Zidon and the gods of Moab and the gods</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the children of Ammon and the gods of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Philistines, and they forsook the Lord and did not serve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Him” </span>(Judges 10:6). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">By</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference from </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is stated: “And they forsook the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord,” do I not know that they did not serve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Him? Rather, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">does the verse state </span>the seemingly unnecessary words <span class="gemarra-regular">“and did not serve Him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? Rabbi Elazar said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: My children did not treat Me even like this lupine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which, </span>because it is inedible as it is, must be <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked </span>in water <span class="gemarra-regular">seven times </span>in order to temper its bitter taste <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>is eventually made so sweet that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eats it as a dessert </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">a meal. </span>They worshipped all seven types of idolatry listed in the verse, and even after I punished them for each and every one of them, they still refused to repent from their evil ways. Instead, they remained rebellious and did not serve Me.
The Gemara considers another aspect of the character of the Jewish people. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Meir: For what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason was the Torah give</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Jewish people? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because they are impudent, </span>and Torah study will weaken and humble them. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>the following with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“From His right hand went a fiery la</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:2); <span class="gemarra-regular">The Holy One, Blessed be He, said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Based on their nature and character, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>people, the Jews, are <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to be given a fiery law, </span>a hard and scorching faith. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The ways </span>and nature <span class="gemarra-regular">of these </span>people, the Jews, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as, were it not for </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah was given to the Jewish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>whose study and observance restrains them, <span class="gemarra-regular">no nation or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tongue could withstand them. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: There are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three impudent ones: The Jewish people among the nations; </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dog among animals; </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">rooster among birds. And some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: Also </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat among small cattle. And some say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Also </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">caper bush among trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ It is taught in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one slaughtered </span>an animal on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">in the field, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may not bring it </span>to his house <span class="gemarra-regular">on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pole, </span>as this appears similar to a weekday activity. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A <span class="gemarra-regular">blind person may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not go out </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">with his cane</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor a shepherd with his satchel. And one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">go out on a chair </span>borne on poles by other people, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither a man nor a woman. </span>All of these are considered weekday activities, the performance of which would display disrespect for the Festival. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi send </span>the following <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an old man </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in our neighborhood who would go out </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">in his litter [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gelodki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they came and asked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, </span>the preeminent authority of the time, whether this was permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">If many </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">need </span>the man to come and lecture them on Torah matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to transport him to the study hall in that manner. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">our Sages relied on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Aḥi Shakkaya, who said: I </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Hinei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shilei and from Shilei </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hinei </span>on a chair of this kind. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yitzḥak said: I </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">brought Mar Shmuel </span>on such a seat on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sun into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shade and from the shade into the sun. </span>All of these incidents indicate that it is in fact permitted to use such a chair on a Festival. The Gemara answers: These cases pose no difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there, it is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with the reason that </span>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If many </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">need him, it is permitted. </span>However, one who is not needed by the public may not go out in such a chair. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥama bar Adda, emissary of </span>the talmudic academies in <span class="gemarra-regular">Zion, </span>who would regularly travel back and forth from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia: <span class="gemarra-regular">When you go up there, </span>to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">take a roundabout </span>route, i.e., do not travel by the shortest path; <span class="gemarra-regular">and go to the Ladder of Tyre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and go to Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi, </span>who lives in Tyre, <span class="gemarra-regular">and raise </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before him: What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do you say with regard to a chair </span>borne on poles; may one go out in such a chair on a Festival? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">By the time he arrived there, Rabbi Ya’akov bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Idi had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">passed away. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he went up </span>to Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">he found Rabbi Zerika </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: What do you say with regard to a chair </span>borne on poles; what is your opinion on this topic? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Rabbi Ami said as follows: </span>It is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he is not carried on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shoulders, </span>on the chair. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided that he is not carried on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shoulders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef, son of Rabba, said: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">on poles [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">alunkei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that are used to carry burdens on the shoulders of two people. This mode of transportation is highly conspicuous and has the appearance of a weekday activity, the performance of which displays disrespect for the Festival. Instead, the poles on which the chair is borne should be held in the bearers’ hands, so the seat will be closer to the ground and less noticeable.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> didn’t Rav Naḥman permit </span>his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">Yalta to go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>a chair borne on <span class="gemarra-regular">poles</span> that rested on the shoulders of the bearers? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yalta is different, as she was afrai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> of falling and therefore required this special arrangement. 
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar and Mar Zutra would be carried </span>to their places in the study hall <span class="gemarra-regular">on the shoulders </span>of their students for the public lecture delivered <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival. </span>They would be carried in that manner <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">fear </span>of falling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>the reason was <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the pushing of the crowd, </span>as these Sages were afraid of being crushed by the large number of people attending the lecture. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A male firstborn of cattle, sheep, or goats belonging to a Jew is sanctified from birth and must be given to a priest to be sacrificed on the altar in the Temple. If a firstborn animal acquired a physical blemish that disqualifies it from being sacrificed as an offering, it still must be given to a priest, but it may be redeemed, slaughtered, and eaten as non-sacred meat. If <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstbor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> animal <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into a cistern </span>on a Festival, and there is concern that it might die there, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: An expert </span>in these matters <span class="gemarra-regular">goes down </span>into the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">and examines </span>the animal. 

Daf 26a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If it has </span>a permanent <span class="gemarra-regular">blemish, </span>owing to which it may be slaughtered and eaten, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may raise it </span>from the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughter </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have a blemish, or if its blemish is temporary, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not slaughter </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>Even if it has a blemish, it is prohibited to slaughter it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>firstborn animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose blemish is not perceptible while it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is still day, </span>i.e., on the day before the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>prior to the Festival for use on the Festival.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">If we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree </span>about whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> examine blemishes on a Festival, </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yehuda holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may examine blemishes on a Festival, and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not examine blemishes on a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them disagree </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> examining blemishes in general </span>on a Festival and not only with respect to the particular case of a firstborn that fell into a cistern.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary</span> to teach the disagreement with regard to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn that fell into a cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> could enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">because of </span>the matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">the suffering of living creatures, one should employ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an artifice </span>to circumvent the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and raise </span>the animal from the cistern. This would be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, </span>who states elsewhere (37a) with regard to a different case that one may employ an artifice in order to rescue an animal that fell into a cistern on a Festival. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon disagree even in the case of a firstborn that fell into a cistern. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>if the mishna mentions the case of a firstborn that fell into a cistern in order to teach that an artifice may not be employed to raise the animal from the cistern, the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">He may not slaughter </span>it, is inaccurate. Rather, it <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">He may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raise </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughter </span>it. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transgressed </span>the prohibition and already <span class="gemarra-regular">raised it, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it could </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say that he may </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that even then he may not do so.
The Gemara expresses wonder at this answer: How could one think that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter it? Isn’t </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished? </span>How could one imagine that it is permitted to slaughter a firstborn that is unblemished? The Gemara answers: This teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it developed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a blemish </span>after it fell. The Gemara challenges this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>how could one think that he may now slaughter the animal? <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t </span>it fall into the category of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it was not fit to be eaten on the eve of the Festival, since at that time it was still unblemished? In that case, it should remain in the category of <span class="it-text">muktze</span> for the duration of the Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">developed a temporary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blemish, </span>one that might eventually heal, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival, and now, </span>after falling, <span class="gemarra-regular">it has a permanent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blemish. Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his mind was </span>set <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the animal as food already before the Festival due to the temporary blemish <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he should </span>now be allowed to <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter it, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that since it was not fit to be eaten before the Festival, it is not considered prepared for use on the Festival. Rather, it falls into the category of <span class="it-text">muktze</span> and may not be slaughtered.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an unblemished firstborn that fell into a cistern </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: An expert </span>in these matters <span class="gemarra-regular">goes down </span>into the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">and examines </span>the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">has a </span>permanent <span class="gemarra-regular">blemish </span>as a result of the fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">raise </span>it from the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughter </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if not, </span>then even if he proceeds to raise it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not slaughter </span>it, even if afterwards it develops a blemish. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: </span>The Sages of earlier generations <span class="gemarra-regular">already said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not examin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blemishes on a Festival. How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a blemish came into being on the eve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a Festival, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not examine it on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>itself to see whether it is in fact of the type that permits the animal to be slaughtered. And if the <span class="gemarra-regular">blemish came into being</span>

Daf 26b

<span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among the </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>prior to the Festival for use on the Festival; therefore, even if it was examined by an expert, it may not be slaughtered. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">agree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was born with its blemish, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among the </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>for use on the Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna taught</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as follows: If a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">was born with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its blemish, </span>experts may <span class="gemarra-regular">examine it on a Festival </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and if the blemish is found to be permanent, the animal may then be slaughtered. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Father would teac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> on this matter that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he transgressed and examined it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">examined </span>after the fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">examine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>even <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stands to reason </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba bar Rav Huna from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">three parts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which suggests that each part contains a novel <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The first section states: If a firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">developed a blemish on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve of a Festival one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not examine it on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>itself, from which one can learn that <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>only <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>examine it; <span class="gemarra-regular">but after the fact, it seems well, </span>and the examination is valid.
The second section of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">it developed a blemish on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: It is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>prior to the Festival for use on the Festival. In other words, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">after the fact, no, </span>if the animal was examined by an expert, it may not be slaughtered and eaten. <span class="gemarra-regular">And then </span>in the third section <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches: And </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">born with its blemish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>for use on the Festival. The fact that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as an independent clause indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well, </span>the animal may be examined.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav Oshaya came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came and brought the </span>following <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his hand: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Whether </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">developed a blemish on the eve of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival or it developed a blemish on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say: It is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>for use on the Festival, so that even after the fact, if the animal was examined, it may not be slaughtered and eaten. According to this, the allowance granted in the case of a firstborn that was born with its blemish can be only after the fact, as argued by Rav Naḥman, and not <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, as maintained by Rabba bar Rav Huna. Why, then, does Abaye accept the opinion of the latter and not that of the former?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited earlier, which presents these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> differently, is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>The Gemara answers: This does not pose a problem, as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>taught by <span class="gemarra-regular">Adda bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ukhmei, who </span>would often <span class="gemarra-regular">confuse </span>the opinions in the text <span class="gemarra-regular">and teach </span>an inaccurate version of the dispute; therefore, his version is unreliable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The mishna is also precise</span> in its wording according to the opinion that no blemish may be examined <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>Even if the animal has a blemish, it is prohibited to slaughter it, since <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>firstborn animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose blemish is not perceptible on the eve of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival </span>while it is still day <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>prior to the Festival for use on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose blemish is not perceptible? If we say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that its blemish is not perceptible at all, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. Need it be said </span>that an animal whose blemish was not perceptible at all prior to the Festival is not considered prepared for use on the Festival?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must say that the animal had a perceptible blemish, but <span class="gemarra-regular">it was not shown to a Sage on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve of the Festival </span>to determine <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permanent blemish or a temporary blemish. In any event, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: It is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>prior to the Festival for use on the Festival, which indicates that it is not considered prepared even after the fact. It follows that the allowance granted in the case of a firstborn that was born with its blemish is also only after the fact, but the blemish may not be examined <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that this is so.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rava: Is there </span>a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for half of Shabbat or is there no </span>prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for half of Shabbat? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">was fit</span> for eating or for some other purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">at twilight </span>between Friday and Shabbat, it would then <span class="gemarra-regular">be fit </span>for the entire Shabbat. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if it was not fit </span>at twilight, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not fit </span>for the entire day, as anything considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> at twilight remains so throughout Shabbat. How, then, could there be a case of an item that is considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> for half of Shabbat?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to raise this dilemma in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">been fit </span>for use, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then became disqualified </span>on Shabbat itself for some reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">became fit. </span>It is about such a case that Hillel asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>Hillel: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a prohibition of<span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> for half of Shabbat, that is to say, once an item becomes disqualified for use on Shabbat, it retains that status for the rest of the day. 
Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection </span>from the previously cited <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was born with its blemish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>before the Festival for use on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">But why</span> should this be? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn was fit at the outset </span>to be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">account of its mother, </span>as had its mother been slaughtered before giving birth to the firstborn, it would have been permitted to eat them both. This being the case, when the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">was born, it became disqualified, </span>since once a firstborn is born, it may not be eaten until it acquires a permanent blemish. And later, when <span class="gemarra-regular">he showed it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a Sage, it </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">became permitted to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This shows that although the animal had the status of <span class="it-text">muktze</span> for part of the day of the Festival, it did not retain that status for the entire day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Safra </span>who said: Here, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where judges were sitting there, </span>observing the firstborn as it was being born, and they immediately saw that it was blemished. Therefore, the animal never lost its permitted status even for a moment. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>the opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Hillel: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no </span>prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for half of Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that is to say, even if an item becomes disqualified for use on Shabbat, once it becomes fit again, it is no longer prohibited. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>the previously cited <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was born with its blemish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>before the Festival for use on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t this firstborn fit </span>to be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">at the outse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on account of its mother; </span>and then when <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was born it became disqualified; </span>and then later, when <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">showed it to a Sage, it </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">became permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him? </span>This indicates that for half of Shabbat there is no prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra </span>who said: This proof is inconclusive, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> may be referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where judges were sitting there </span>when the firstborn was born, and they immediately saw that it was blemished; therefore the animal never acquired the status of <span class="it-text">muktze</span> at all.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was eating grapes and left </span>some over <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">took them up to the roof </span>to dry in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to make them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">raisins, </span>or if he was eating <span class="gemarra-regular">figs and left </span>some over <span class="gemarra-regular">and took them up to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the roof </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to make them </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">dried figs, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not eat from them </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designates them </span>as food to be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">still day. </span>Otherwise, they are prohibited as <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And you </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">find the same with regard to peaches, and quinces, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and all other types of fruit </span>that one left out to dry. It is prohibited to eat any of them on Shabbat due to the prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. 
The Gemara proceeds to clarify this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If they are fit </span>to be eaten, as they have already dried, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does he require </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">designation? </span>Since he placed them there in order to eat them after they dried, they should be considered food that has been designated to be eaten. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if they are not fit </span>to be eaten, as they are yet not dry, even <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he designates them </span>the day before, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it? </span>Of what use is such designation, seeing that the fruit is still unfit to be eaten?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where he could not ascend to the roof to examine them, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not know whether they were fit or unfit, </span>so that his designation was conditional, there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">As didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t Rav Kahana say: </span>If fruit had been <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span>for drying, and it <span class="gemarra-regular">dried </span>and became fit for eating before Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the owner did not know about it </span>before Shabbat but only on Shabbat, the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>since he removed it from his mind only for as long as it would be unfit for eating. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">were fit, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became disqualified, and then </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">became fit, </span>and therefore they have the status of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> for half of Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do they require </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">designation? </span>The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>then do you say, that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>in fact a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> for half of Shabbat? In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he designates them </span>the day before, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it? </span>How does his designation permit that which is prohibited as <span class="it-text">muktze</span>? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">were fit but not </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">that there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are people who eat </span>them in that state <span class="gemarra-regular">and there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">people who do not eat </span>them. Therefore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he designated </span>them as food to be eaten, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has revealed his intention </span>that he is included among those who do eat them; if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not designate </span>them as food, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not revealed his intention. </span>Therefore, no proof can be adduced from here.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to the problem raised above <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">beans and lentils </span>cooked on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">As beans and lentils at the outset, </span>at twilight, when they are still raw and uncooked, <span class="gemarra-regular">are fit to be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">chewed </span>as they are and are therefore not in the category of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>; then, when <span class="gemarra-regular">he casts them into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pot </span>to cook them, <span class="gemarra-regular">they become disqualified </span>because while they are being cooked they are fit neither to be chewed raw nor to be eaten cooked. 

Daf 27a

And then when <span class="gemarra-regular">their cooking is finished</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">become fit </span>for eating. This demonstrates that even food that had temporarily been set aside because it had become inedible does not remain prohibited for the entire day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to your reasoning </span>that foods are temporarily considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> while being cooked, <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked dishes in general </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you </span>on Shabbat as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">As ordinary cooked dishes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in general are </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">bubbling at twilight </span>and not yet edible, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we partake of them </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> evening. </span>This demonstrates that although the food was considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> at the critical moment of twilight, it is not prohibited for the duration of Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">we have no dilemma </span>with regard to a food <span class="gemarra-regular">whose completion, which </span>brings it to its finished and edible form, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">in the hands of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a person, </span>e.g., beans and lentils. Such foods are certainly not considered as <span class="it-text">muktze</span> for all of Shabbat simply because they had become temporarily unfit for eating. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we have a dilemma </span>is with regard to an item <span class="gemarra-regular">whose completion is in the hands of Heaven, </span>such as figs and grapes, which dry by the heat of the sun. This dilemma remains unresolved.
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of permitting firstborn animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda Nesia had a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> firstborn </span>animal that acquired a blemish on a Festival, and he wished to serve it to priests staying at his house. <span class="gemarra-regular">He sent it to </span>be presented <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Ami</span> for examination, and Rabbi Ami <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> examine it, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zerika said to him, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya: </span>The principle is that in cases of dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who in this case permits examination of the firstborn. Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <span class="gemarra-regular">then sent </span>the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be presented <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yitzḥak </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nappaḥa, </span>who likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">not examine it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Yirmeya said to him, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zerika: </span>The principle is that in cases where <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon </span>disagree, the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rabbi Yirmeya: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not allow the Sages to act in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon? He said to him: And you, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what do you have? </span>Do you have a tradition that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon? Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as follows: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>unidentified <span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>in Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> May it be His will that <span class="gemarra-regular">I merit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to go up there </span>to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learn </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching from the mouth of its Master; </span>I will ask Rabbi Zeira himself for his opinion on this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he went up there </span>to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he found Rabbi Zeira </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Master say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon? </span>Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>that is not what I said; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">I said: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stands to reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that this is so. It is reasonable to rule in accordance with Rabbi Shimon on this issue, although I do not have a definitive tradition to this effect. 
Rabbi Zeira explains: Why do I think so? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it teaches in the mishna </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>firstborn animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose blemish is not perceptible while it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is still day is not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">among </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>prior to the Festival for use on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the same ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name of the Sages, </span>indicating that this is the majority opinion. One should therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this that it stands</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to reason </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. 
The Gemara asks: In the final analysis, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>this matter? Whose opinion does the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follow? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as </span>this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">hangs on great trees, </span>meaning it is the subject of a dispute among the early Sages. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua ben Levi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said in the name of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holy community in Jerusalem: Rabbi Shimon </span>ben Menasya <span class="gemarra-regular">and his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">colleagues said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir.</span>
The Gemara wonders at the wording of this report: How could the holy community in Jerusalem have reported that Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <span class="gemarra-regular">Aren’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t they much older than he? </span>Why, then, would they have reported a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in his name? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the holy community in Jerusalem said the following: Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues, who said that one may not examine blemishes on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke in </span>accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the opinion of Rabbi Meir. </span>
To which teaching of Rabbi Meir is the Gemara referring? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 28a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one slaughtered a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn </span>before it was shown to a Sage and deemed permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he showed its blemish </span>to a Sage, who confirmed that it was indeed a permanent blemish that permitted the animal to be slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda permits </span>it, as it had been established that the animal was blemished. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Meir says: Since it was slaughtered without </span>the permission <span class="gemarra-regular">of an expert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is prohibited. Apparently Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the examination of a firstborn is not </span>as simple a process <span class="gemarra-regular">as the examination of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since it involves more than a mere examination of the body of the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">The examination of a firstborn </span>must be conducted <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the animal is <span class="gemarra-regular">alive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> examination of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span> may be performed even <span class="gemarra-regular">after slaughtering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from this </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and his colleagues inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the examination</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which consists merely of clarifying the facts of the animal’s physical state, may be done <span class="gemarra-regular">even on a Festival. </span>On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>more stringent <span class="gemarra-regular">examination of a firstborn, </span>which can be likened to the rendering of a judgment, a process with principles of its own, must be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span> to Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in that mishna, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>about whether or not one may <span class="gemarra-regular">examine blemishes </span>on a Festival? That was not their dispute; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the question of whether or not there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">penalty </span>for one who acted improperly. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabba bar bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>If the blemish was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the eyelids, </span>e.g., if a fissure developed there that disqualifies the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>including Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, because </span>such a blemish <span class="gemarra-regular">changes </span>its appearance after the slaughter. It is possible that after slaughter what was a temporary blemish will then look like a permanent one, and the animal will incorrectly be permitted retroactively.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree </span>is in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">blemishes in the body, </span>e.g., if an ear had been cut off or a foreleg broken, which are prominent blemishes whose appearance does not change after death. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds that we issue a decre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">blemishes in the body </span>are prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to blemishes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the eye, and Rabbi Yehuda holds that we do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not issue </span>such a <span class="gemarra-regular">decree.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>The wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was slaughtered without </span>the permission of <span class="gemarra-regular">an expert </span>who confirmed that this is a permanent blemish, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Learn from this </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">a penalty </span>that Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">imposes </span>and nothing else. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this </span>that this is the correct understanding of the mishna.
§ The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ami of Vardin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">the examiner of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> firstborns in the household of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Nasi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. On Festivals he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would not examine </span>firstborn blemishes. <span class="gemarra-regular">They came and told Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ami </span>about this. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: He does well</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not to examine </span>them. The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that so? But didn’t Rabbi Ami himself examine </span>firstborns for blemishes on a Festival? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ami would examine </span>the blemishes of firstborns, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day before </span>the Festival that <span class="gemarra-regular">he would examine </span>them, to see whether the blemishes were permanent or temporary. 

Daf 27b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And on the Festival </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would as</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">how the incident occurred, </span>meaning that he would investigate the cause of the blemish, <span class="gemarra-regular">as in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a certain man </span>who was a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">brought a firstborn before Rava, </span>close to <span class="gemarra-regular">nightfall on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival eve. Rava was sitting and washing </span>the hair on <span class="gemarra-regular">his head. He raised his eyes and saw </span>the firstborn’s <span class="gemarra-regular">blemish. He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner of the firstborn: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go now, and come </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When he came </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">following day, </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: How did the incident </span>that caused the blemish <span class="gemarra-regular">occur? </span>The owner <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">Barley </span>grains <span class="gemarra-regular">were scattered on one side of a fence </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of thorns, while </span>the firstborn <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>standing <span class="gemarra-regular">on the other </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side. When it wanted to eat, it stuck its head </span><span class="gemarra-regular">through the fence and a thorn cut its lip. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the owner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps you caused </span>the blemish by deliberately placing the barley on the other side of the fence? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: No. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say that causing </span>a blemish to an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is written with regard to offerings: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">There must not be </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">blemish in it” </span>(Leviticus 22:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">I have only </span>an explicit prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">that it may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have a blemish; from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not cause </span>a blemish <span class="gemarra-regular">to it by means of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> something else, </span>e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not bring dough</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a dried fig and place it on its ear</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so that a dog will com</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and take it, </span>thereby biting off part of the animal’s ear and leaving it blemished? Therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “any blemish.” It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says “blemish” and it says “any blemish”; </span>the word “any” comes to teach that one may not cause a blemish.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal that died, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not move </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it from its place </span>on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">incident </span>once occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">and they asked Rabbi Tarfon about it. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>on that same occasion they also asked him <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>had been separated from dough and then <span class="gemarra-regular">became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ritually impure </span>on a Festival. Such <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> is not fit to be eaten by anyone, nor may it be used in any other manner, e.g., as animal feed or as fuel for a fire, on that day. Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">entered the study hall and inquired </span>about these matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not move</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them from their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned the unattributed </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 156b) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">cut up gourds for an animal </span>on Shabbat so that it can eat them more easily, and similarly, one may cut up <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span>unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass for dogs. Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: If it was not an animal carcass </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the eve of Shabbat, </span>but rather it died on Shabbat itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited. </span>Since Rabbi Yehuda distinguishes between an animal that died on Shabbat and one that died before Shabbat, it would appear that Rabbi Shimon holds that one may move an animal carcass and feed it to dogs even if it died on Shabbat. Accordingly, the mishna that prohibits moving an animal that died on a Festival seems to conflict with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: The mishna can be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals that </span>were entirely healthy at twilight but <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>on the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">that they are prohibited. </span>Since they were healthy at twilight, the owner had no intention at that point in time of feeding them to dogs, and they are therefore prohibited as <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, on the other hand, is referring to an animal that had been sick on the previous day; since the owner knew that it was close to death, he had in mind to feed it to his dogs after it died.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Ameimar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rava, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concedes in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals that died </span>on the Festival without having been mortally sick the day before <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are prohibited </span>on the Festival due to <span class="it-text">muktze</span>; according to this opinion, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">well. However, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar, son of Rav Yosef, in the name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rava, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon was in disagreemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals that died </span>suddenly, and he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are permitted, what is there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say? </span>The unattributed mishna appears to contradict this opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ze’iri explained it </span>as follows: The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a sacred animal </span>that died; since it is sacred property, one may not derive benefit from it, and therefore one may not give it to dogs. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>according to this interpretation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches: </span>They asked Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it and about </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that became ritually impure, </span>from which it may be inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is sacred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, so too, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span>mentioned here is one <span class="gemarra-regular">that was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacred, </span>rather than a non-sacred animal.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that the animal may not be moved <span class="gemarra-regular">is that </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was sacred; but </span>if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-sacred </span>animal that died, it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to move it. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar, son of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef, in the name of Rava, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon was in disagreement even in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that died, </span>and he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are permitted; </span>according to this opinion, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">well, </span>as one can say that the mishna, which indicates that one may move an animal that died on a Festival, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Ameimar in the name of Rava, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon concedes in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals that died that they are prohibited, what is there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say? </span>The mishna is in accordance with neither Rabbi Shimon nor Rabbi Yehuda. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case where the animal was <span class="gemarra-regular">in danger </span>of dying the day before, and the owner had in mind to feed it to his dogs after it died, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>with regard to the ruling. Therefore, according to Rabbi Shimon, an allowance is granted to move the animal if it was a non-sacred animal and it had been in danger prior to the Festival; and if the animal was sacred, even he agrees that it is prohibited, as it may not be fed to dogs. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">registe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to have a portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of an animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since it is prohibited to divide up an animal into portions for different people, as this is similar to conducting business, a weekday activity, on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">registe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">on the eve of the Festival, and </span>then those who registered for the animal may <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter and divide </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>on the Festival itself in accordance with the agreement reached the day before. The next day, each pays the slaughterer according to his portion of the animal.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">not register? Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: One</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">not fix </span>a sum <span class="gemarra-regular">of money </span>and set a particular price for each portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of an animal on a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Festiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do </span>on a Festival to divide up the animal without fixing a price? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: He </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">bring two animals</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and stand them one next to the other and say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">this one equal </span>in value <span class="gemarra-regular">to the other </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one? </span>If the purchasers confirm that this is the case, then after the Festival they assess the value of the animal that is identical to the animal that had been slaughtered on the Festival, and in that way they establish the amount that each person must pay. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not say to another </span>on a Festival: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby </span>in partnership <span class="gemarra-regular">with you </span>in this animal that you are about to slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">for the value </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby </span>in partnership <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you for two </span><span class="it-text">sela</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: I am hereby </span>in partnership <span class="gemarra-regular">with you for half </span>the animal, or <span class="gemarra-regular">for a third or a quarter, </span>without stipulating the value of that share, and after the Festival they may determine how much each share is worth. 

Daf 28a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: A person </span>selling meat on a Festival who wishes to know its weight in order to determine its price may not weigh it against regular weights in the ordinary weekday manner, but he may <span class="gemarra-regular">weigh </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">meat against </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">vesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or against </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">cleaver [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kofitz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and then calculate the weight of the meat by weighing the vessel or cleaver later. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">look at the pans of a </span>balance <span class="gemarra-regular">scal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning that they may not be used for weighing in any manner or for any other purpose.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: One may not look at the pans of a scale <span class="gemarra-regular">at all? Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Even </span>if one has meat and he wishes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">protect it from mice, </span>he may not put it on a scale, since it would look as if he were weighing it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin said: And this </span>ruling applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the scale <span class="gemarra-regular">is hanging on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> used for balancing it. However, if the scale is hanging in such a manner that it is not fit for weighing, one may use it as he would use any other vessel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: It is prohibited for an expert butcher to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> weigh meat </span>on a Festival even <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand </span>because he can arrive at its precise weight using this method, and so it is prohibited like weighing with a scale. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: It is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for an expert butcher to weigh meat </span>on a Festival even <span class="gemarra-regular">in water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Butchers would calculate the weight of a slab of meat by placing it into a tub of water and measuring the amount of water that it displaces with the help of markings on the container. Since this procedure enables the butcher to determine the precise weight of the meat, it may not be performed on a Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It is prohibited to make </span>a hole to serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">a handle in mea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on a Festival, since this is a weekday act. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: But it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>to make such a handle <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand, </span>rather than with a knife or some other implement, since this is an atypical manner of making a hole.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: It is permitted to make a sign</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on meat </span>even on a Festival, so that it not be mistaken for the meat of another person. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that which Rabba bar Rav Huna </span>would do when he sent meat by means of a messenger to his house; he would <span class="gemarra-regular">cut it into triangles </span>as a sign that the meat was his and it was fit to be eaten.
The Gemara relates an incident in connection to the basic <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, would <span class="gemarra-regular">weigh </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">portion against </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">portio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival </span>in order to divide the meat between them. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion did they do so? This seems to be <span class="gemarra-regular">neither in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>in the mishna. As, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t he say: A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">weigh meat against a vessel or against a cleaver, </span>from which it may be inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">Against a vessel </span>or a cleaver, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>one may do so; but <span class="gemarra-regular">against anything </span><span class="gemarra-regular">else, no, </span>he may not. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, didn’t they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not look at the pans of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scale at all?</span>
The Gemara explains: Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">acted in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua says: One may weigh </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">portion against </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">portion on a Festival. Rav Yosef said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, since we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Bekhorot</span> (31a)<span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his </span>opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>there: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated animals that have become</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disqualified </span>because of a blemish, all <span class="gemarra-regular">the benefit </span>that accrues <span class="gemarra-regular">from their </span>sale belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>Temple treasury of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated</span> property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">weigh </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>of meat <span class="gemarra-regular">against</span> another <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>of meat <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of a <span class="gemarra-regular">firstbor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that developed a blemish. Although the meat of a firstborn may not be sold by weight in the manner of non-sacred meat, one may weigh one portion against another portion in order to determine its price. This indicates that even in a case where it is prohibited to weigh an item in the ordinary manner, one may still weigh one portion of it against another portion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: Perhaps that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not so, </span>and the two cases are not similar. It is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua stated </span>his opinion that one may weigh one portion against another <span class="gemarra-regular">only here, </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the action does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>involve a show of <span class="gemarra-regular">degradation of sacred </span>items; <span class="gemarra-regular">but there, </span>in the case of a firstborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the weighing involves a display of <span class="gemarra-regular">degradation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of sacred </span>items, perhaps he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit weighing of any kind. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis stated </span>their opinion that one may weigh one portion against another <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>in the case of a firstborn, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it does not look </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like a weekday activity; but here, </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it looks like a weekday activity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> perhaps they would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>have permitted it. It is therefore possible that even the Rabbis would prohibit this action on a Festival.
With regard to the incident involving Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that they were particular</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with each other </span>with regard to such matters, to the extent that they had to weigh one portion against another so that their portions would be exactly equal? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t </span>there the incident of <span class="gemarra-regular">the seven fish that were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brought to the house of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and five</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them were </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">found in the house </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiyya, </span>who had taken them from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi; <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">was not particular</span> about this, as they treated each other like family?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Cast a person between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them. </span>In other words, a third party must have been involved in the incident. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Either </span>the two who divided the meat between themselves were <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, or </span>else they were <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and bar Kappara. </span>Although these pairs of scholars were colleagues, they were exacting with each other in monetary matters. Consequently, they weighed one portion of meat against the other to ensure that they would each receive the same amount.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sharpe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a knife on a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival </span>in the ordinary weekday manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one </span>may do so in an unusual fashion, e.g., to <span class="gemarra-regular">run </span>one knife <span class="gemarra-regular">over another, </span>thereby sharpening the blade.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna said: They taught </span>that one may not sharpen a knife on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if he does so in the typical manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">with a stone </span>knife <span class="gemarra-regular">sharpener, but </span>if he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">with a wooden </span>knife <span class="gemarra-regular">sharpener, it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as this is an unusual way of sharpening knives. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which you said, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a stone </span>sharpener <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>one’s intention is <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sharpen </span>the knife, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he merely means <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>accumulated <span class="gemarra-regular">fat </span>by scraping it off with the stone, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted. </span>This proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that with </span>a sharpener made <span class="gemarra-regular">of wood, even </span>if his intention is <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sharpen </span>the knife, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach </span>the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause </span>of Rav Huna’s statement, where he says: But if he uses a sharpener made <span class="gemarra-regular">of wood, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted. Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which you said, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with a wooden </span>sharpener it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>one’s intention is <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove its fat, but </span>if he does so in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to sharpen it, it is prohibited. </span>This proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>with a sharpener made <span class="gemarra-regular">of stone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even </span>if he intended merely <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove its fat, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some teach </span>the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the mishna </span>itself, which teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not sharpen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a knife on a Festival. Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They taught </span>that this is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>where one’s intention is <span class="gemarra-regular">to sharpen </span>the knife, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if his aim is merely <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove its fat, it is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>running one knife <span class="gemarra-regular">over another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted even </span>if his intention is <span class="gemarra-regular">to sharpen </span>the knife.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some teach</span> the statement of Rav Yehuda as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>of the mishna, which teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">run </span>one knife <span class="gemarra-regular">over another. Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>where one’s intention is <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove its fat, but </span>if he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sharpen it, it is prohibited. </span>This proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with a sharpener, it is prohibited even to remove its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fat.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who holds <span class="gemarra-regular">that with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a sharpener it is </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited? Rav Ḥisda said: </span>This <span class="it-text">tanna</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between a Festival and Shabbat is only </span>with regard to the preparation of <span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>as it is permitted to perform labor for the purpose of food preparation on a Festival, but not on Shabbat; <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda permits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>actions that <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitate preparation of food </span>on a Festival, e.g., repairing utensils with which food is prepared on the Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda: We teach in your name </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: May it be </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">will that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you teach in my name all outstanding matters like this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In other words, Rav Ḥisda was pleased that this teaching was attributed to him, as he too agreed with it.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said: I was </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">standing before Rava, and he was</span> 

Daf 28b

<span class="gemarra-regular">running a knife over the rim of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And I said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master doing </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to sharpen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it or </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove its fat? And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to me: To remove its fat. And I </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">perceived his intention, that he did so </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sharpen it. </span>He concealed this from me, however, because <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but a </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling is not issued to that effect;</span> therefore he did not wish to permit the practice explicitly.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: I was standing before my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master </span>and teacher, Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he was running a knife</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over the edge of a millstone </span>on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And I said to him: </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master wish to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sharpen it, or </span>is he doing this in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remove its fat? And he said to me: To remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its fat. And I perceived his intention, that he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to sharpen it, but he holds: </span>This is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but a </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling is not issued</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to that effect</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to showing a </span>slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">knife to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Sag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival </span>so that he may examine it for nicks and imperfections that would render it unfit to be used for slaughtering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Bizna, permitted </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas the Rabbis prohibited </span>it, as this is somewhat similar to a weekday activity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef said: A Torah scholar may examine </span>a knife <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>in his own home <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">lend it to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">others, </span>who may also slaughter with it. Since the examination is not performed in public, it does not appear similar to a weekday activity. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a knife that became blunt </span>without being nicked, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to sharpen it on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And this applies </span>only if the knife still <span class="gemarra-regular">cuts, </span>albeit <span class="gemarra-regular">with difficulty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that when he sharpens it he is seen not as making a new utensil but merely as improving an old one. However, if the knife no longer cuts at all, it is prohibited to sharpen it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda taught, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>who taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">A knife that became nicked </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>roasting <span class="gemarra-regular">skewer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shappud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was crushed </span>on a Festival and its point broke off, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the sweeping of </span>the coals in <span class="gemarra-regular">an oven and a stove on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>to prepare them for baking, with regard to all of these <span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived at the dispute between Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda and the Rabbis. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between a Festival and Shabbat is only</span> with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation of food. Rabbi Yehuda permits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>actions that <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitate preparation of foo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on a Festival.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> for prohibiting actions that facilitate food preparation? <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: </span>“Save that which every person must eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alone may be done for you” </span>(Exodus 12:16), from which it may be inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That” </span>may be done on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>actions that <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitate it. And Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda </span>adduces proof for his view from the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “For you,” </span>indicating: <span class="gemarra-regular">For you, for all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your needs, </span>and that which facilitates food preparation is also a need.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, is it not written “for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you”? </span>What does he learn from this phrase? The Gemara answers: That <span class="it-text">tanna</span> could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>phrase comes to teach: <span class="gemarra-regular">For you, but not for gentiles. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span><span class="it-text">tanna</span>, Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">too, isn’t it written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">That,” </span>which indicates a limitation? The Gemara explains that Rabbi Yehuda could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>The limiting word <span class="gemarra-regular">“that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” is written, and </span>the expansive phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“for you,” </span>indicating all your needs, <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult </span>and no contradiction is involved. One can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>actions that <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitate </span>food preparation <span class="gemarra-regular">that can be performed on the eve of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival; </span>the Torah prohibits these on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>actions that <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitate </span>food preparation <span class="gemarra-regular">that cannot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be performed on the eve of the Festival. </span>The latter may be performed even on the Festival itself, as they too are part of the preparation of food, similar to cooking.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to a roasting <span class="gemarra-regular">skewer that became bent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited to repair it on a Festival. </span>The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; </span>it is clear that one may not fix a utensil on a Festival. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a particular case: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although </span>the skewer <span class="gemarra-regular">can be straightened</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by hand </span>and no special tool is needed for this task, it is nevertheless prohibited. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a skewer upon which one roasted meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is prohibited to move it on a Festival, </span>as it has already served its purpose on the Festival, and it is not fit for any other use. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ahava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Malkiyu said: He </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">pull</span> the skewer <span class="gemarra-regular">out and place it in a corner </span>so that it will not endanger anyone, as it could if it were left in the middle of the house. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: And this </span>ruling applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the skewer <span class="gemarra-regular">has an olive-bulk of meat on it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> in such a case he may move the skewer on account of the meat and drag it into the corner in an unusual manner. However, if it does not have an olive-bulk of meat on it, he may not move it at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: Although it does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not have </span>an olive-bulk of <span class="gemarra-regular">meat on it, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted to move it </span>in the regular manner and place it in a corner, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a thorn </span>lying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain. </span>For the sake of public safety, it is permitted to remove such a thorn by moving it in increments, each less than four cubits. The same applies to this skewer; since it might harm someone where it is, it may be moved to a corner.
Apropos Rav Malkiyu, to whom only a few <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are attributed, the Gemara mentions that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ika, said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a skewer </span>that had been used for roasting meat but no longer has an olive-bulk of meat on it, that it may be moved to a corner; and likewise, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservants, </span>that even if a woman brought one hundred maidservants into the marriage as her dowry, her husband may nevertheless compel her to perform some sort of work so that her boredom not bring her to sin (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 61b); <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> finally, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">follicles, </span>that if a girl has two hair follicles in her pubic region, even if there are no hairs growing from them, she is considered to have reached majority and may perform <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>; these three <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> were all stated by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Malkiyu.</span>
However, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a forelock, </span>that a Jew who cuts the hair of a Samaritan must stop before he reaches his forelock at a distance of three fingerbreadths on every side, as the Samaritans would grow their forelocks for idolatry, and the Jew must not appear as if he were dressing the forelock for idolatrous purposes; and likewise, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt ashes, </span>that one may not place them on a wound, as it looks like a tattoo; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>finally, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">cheese </span>made by a gentile, that it is forbidden because gentiles smooth the surface of their cheese with lard; these three <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> were all stated by a different Sage named <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Malkiya.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Pappa said </span>a different principle: The teachings mentioned above that relate to <span class="gemarra-regular">a mishna or a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> were stated by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Malkiya, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span> that are not related to a mishna or <span class="it-text">baraita</span> were taught by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Malkiyu. And your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mnemonic </span>to remember this <span class="gemarra-regular">is: The mishna is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">queen </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">malketa</span>]; the comments that are referring to a mishna were made by Rav Malkiya, whose name is similar to the Aramaic term for queen. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span> the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>Rav Ḥinnana and Rav Pappa? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservants. </span>According to Rav Ḥinnana, this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was stated by Rav Malkiyu, whereas Rav Pappa holds that it was taught by Rav Malkiya, since it is referring to a dispute in a mishna. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not say to a butcher </span>on a Festival: <span class="gemarra-regular">Weigh for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a dinar’s worth of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meat, </span>since if he mentions a sum of money, it looks like a commercial transaction. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the butcher may <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and apportion it </span>among his customers without stipulating a price.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>should one <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>if he wishes to take part of an animal on a Festival, but is barred from mentioning its price? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span>

Daf 29a

<span class="gemarra-regular">they would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say in Sura: </span>Give me that cut of meat called <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tart</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or half a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>without naming a price. <span class="gemarra-regular">In Neresh they would say </span>in reference to those same portions: <span class="gemarra-regular">A part or half a part. In Pumbedita </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they would say: An </span><span class="gemarra-italic">uzya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or half an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">uzya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nehar Pekod and in Mata Meḥasya they would say: </span>Give me <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter or half a quarter, </span>thereby establishing the size of the portion without mentioning its price.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>on a Festival: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fill this vessel for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and I will return its contents or reimburse you after the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>ask him to fill the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">measure. Rabbi Yehuda says: If it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a measuring utensil, he may not fill it. </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving Abba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shau</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Botnit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a Sage who was also a grocer, <span class="gemarra-regular">who would fill his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measures on the eve of a Festival and give them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">customers on the Festival. </span>In this way he would know exactly how much he had given each person, without conducting any measurements on the Festival itself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul, </span>a Sage distinct from Abba Shaul ben Botnit, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He would do this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even on </span>the intermediate days of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival because of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the clarity of the measures, </span>i.e., in order to clarify precisely how much must be given to each customer, since the measurement is more precise once the foam of the liquid being measured has subsided. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even on a weekday </span>it is proper to <span class="gemarra-regular">do so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because of the draining of the measures. </span>This method allows all the liquid to drain fully out of the seller’s measuring utensil so that the amount is exact. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not in a measure? Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: But not with a vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designated for measuring; however, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">be used for measuring </span>but has yet to be used for this purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">fill it. </span>According to this, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda comes to </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not fill even a vessel that </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> used for measuring.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda is stringent with regard to the joy of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Festival </span>in that he prohibits the use of any sort of measuring utensil, <span class="gemarra-regular">while the Rabbis are lenient. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we hear them </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in an earlier mishna (28a) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: A person </span>selling meat on a Festival may <span class="gemarra-regular">weigh </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">meat against a vessel or against a cleaver, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not look at the pans </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span>balance <span class="gemarra-regular">scale at all? Apparently, </span>here, the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda is lenient, while the </span>opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis is stringent. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a contradiction between </span>the one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>as well as <span class="gemarra-regular">a contradiction between </span>the one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara answers: With regard to the contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the one teaching of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and </span>the other teaching of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. There, </span>where he is lenient, he is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">that cannot be used</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for measuring </span>on a regular basis at all, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he is referring to a vessel that <span class="gemarra-regular">can be used</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for measuring, </span>and therefore he is stringent even if the vessel has not yet actually been used in this capacity.
With regard to the contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">also not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. There, he is acting in a weekday manner, </span>and consequently they prohibit the weighing, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, he is not acting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a weekday manner, </span>as the vessel is not a measuring utensil, and consequently they permit him to use it. This completes the Gemara’s discussion of Shmuel’s explanation of the mishna. 
The Gemara offers a second explanation of the mishna. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said: What is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by measure? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not mention to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him the name of the measure. </span>For example, he may not say: Fill for me one <span class="it-text">kav</span>, or two <span class="it-text">kav</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">fill a vessel </span>even if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">designated for measuring. And Rabbi Yehuda comes to say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not fill a vessel designated for measuring, </span>even if he does not stipulate a particular measure. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, with regard to the joy of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival, Rabbi Yehuda is stringent, and the Rabbis are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lenient. But didn’t we hear them </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in an earlier mishna (28a) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">weigh meat against a vessel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or against a cleaver, and the Rabbis </span>prohibit this and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not look at the pans of a </span>balance <span class="gemarra-regular">scale at all? Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda is lenient, while </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis are stringent. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a contradiction between</span> one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>and there is also <span class="gemarra-regular">a contradiction between </span>one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara answers: With regard to the contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>one teaching of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and</span> the other teaching of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. There, </span>with regard to weighing meat against a vessel, he is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not designated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for measuring, </span>and therefore he is lenient, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>he is referring to a vessel that <span class="gemarra-regular">is designated for measuring, </span>with regard to which he is stringent. With regard to the contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">also not difficult. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">There, he is acting in a weekday manner, </span>and consequently they prohibit the weighing, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, he is not acting </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a weekday manner, as people are accustomed to offer </span>their friends <span class="gemarra-regular">wine in a measuring utensil and drink. </span>Since the use of such a vessel is not exclusive to commercial transactions, the Rabbis permitted it here as well. 
§ The mishna recounted <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving Abba Shaul ben Botnit, </span>a Sage who was also a grocer, who would fill his measures on the eve of a Festival and give them to his customers on the Festival. A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He would do this even on </span>the intermediate days of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, in order to </span>prevent <span class="gemarra-regular">dereliction </span>of Torah study in <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall. </span>Since he wanted to spend most of his day in the study hall and not have to interrupt his study to carry out measurements, he would measure for his customers at night, when it was not a time of study. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Abba Shaul ben Botnit <span class="gemarra-regular">collected three hundred earthenware jugs of wine, </span>to which he thought he was not entitled <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the clarity of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the measures</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he thought that he had unfairly profited from the foam at the top of the liquid he measured. <span class="gemarra-regular">And his colleagues, </span>similarly God-fearing grocers, <span class="gemarra-regular">collecte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three hundred earthenware jugs of oil, </span>which they thought were not rightly theirs <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the draining of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measures; </span>they were concerned that because they had measured for their customers using their own vessels, they might not have drained the entire measure from their containers into the customers’ vessels. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they brought </span>these jugs of wine and oil <span class="gemarra-regular">to Jerusalem before the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">treasurers, </span>as they did not want to benefit from possibly stolen goods. 
The treasurers <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: You </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need not do this, </span>as all buyers take into account the foam and what is left in the sellers’ vessels and pay with this in mind. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to them: </span>Just like the buyers give up their claim to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">we too do not wish </span>to benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from this, </span>even if strictly speaking it is not considered stolen property.
The treasurers <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Since you are </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent with yourselves, use </span>the wine and oil <span class="gemarra-regular">for communal needs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">stole and does not know </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from who</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he stole, he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>the stolen items <span class="gemarra-regular">for communal needs, </span>thereby repaying all of the Jewish people. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are </span>communal needs? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>He should finance the digging of <span class="gemarra-regular">cisterns, ditches, and caves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for storing water for travelers. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda authorized Rabbana Ukva </span>to give a public lecture, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he taught </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not measure barle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and place </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his animal on a Festival, but he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">cut out</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">koder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> a hole in the pile of grain by means of a vessel of one <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and place </span>the barley <span class="gemarra-regular">before his animal, and he need</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not be concerned </span>about the measuring this entails, as he does not transgress the prohibition against using a measuring utensil if he is not particular about measuring precisely. <span class="gemarra-regular">And a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> baker </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">measure spice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and put them in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pot, so as not to spoil his dish, </span>since if he puts in too much he will ruin the food.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A woman </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">measure flour on a Festival and put </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it into her dough in order to separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> generously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>because if she knows the exact amount of dough she can separate the proper amount of <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, </span>as she can estimate the amount that must be set aside as <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stating that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Now that </span>it is known that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited and </span>a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Shmuel taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>

Daf 29b

it is reasonable to conclude that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel came to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach us the practical </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Knowing that a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> permits the practice, Shmuel found it necessary to state that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is otherwise. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sift <span class="gemarra-regular">flour a second time on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as this involves unnecessary extra effort. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name of Rabbi Papeyyas and Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira: One</span> may sift flour <span class="gemarra-regular">a second time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, they </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that if a pebble or a wood chip fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into </span>the flour after it had been sifted the previous day, one may sift it <span class="gemarra-regular">a second time </span>in order to remove the items.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Ravina: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sift <span class="gemarra-regular">flour a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> second time on a Festival, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a pebbl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or a wood chip fell </span>into the flour after the first sifting, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">remove it with his hand. </span>Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: All the more so </span>is the latter procedure <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, as it is similar to </span>the prohibited labor of <span class="gemarra-regular">selecting. </span>It is therefore preferable to sift the flour with a sieve, and the unwanted items will thereby be removed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna the Short taught at the entrance to Neharde’a: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may sift <span class="gemarra-regular">flour a second time on a Festival. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to </span>the students standing before him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out and say to Abba, </span>i.e., to Rava bar Rav Huna, as Rava is a shortened form of Rav Abba: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your good has been removed and cast upon thorns, </span>meaning that your teachings are not needed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Go out and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">see how many sieves circulat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Neharde’a, </span>as all the women already know that this is permitted.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef’s wife was </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">sifting flour </span>in an unusual manner <span class="gemarra-regular">on the reverse </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">of a sieve. He said to her: Look, I want</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> good-quality bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> hinting that she need not invert the sieve but may sift the flour in her regular fashion. The Gemara likewise relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi’s wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">sifting flour onto a table, </span>rather than into a bowl in the usual manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">of ours, </span>my wife, is <span class="gemarra-regular">the daughter of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama, and Rami bar Ḥama is a master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>good <span class="gemarra-regular">deeds </span>who is meticulous in his performance of mitzvot. <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>my wife <span class="gemarra-regular">not observed </span>this practice <span class="gemarra-regular">in her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father’s house, she would not have acted </span>in this manner. Therefore, one can learn the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in practice from her actions.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a grocer </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he is accustomed </span>to buy <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Give me eggs and nuts of </span>such-and-such <span class="gemarra-regular">a number, as it is the manner of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a homeowner to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">coun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> this way <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Counting eggs or nuts is not considered a commercial activity, as people regularly mention the number of eggs and nuts that they need. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">to a shepherd </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he is accustomed </span>to deal <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to him: Give </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me one kid, or one lamb. </span>Similarly, one may go on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">to a butcher </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed </span>to buy <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to him: Give me one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foreleg </span>of an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">or one thigh. </span>Likewise, one may approach <span class="gemarra-regular">one who deals in fattened </span>fowl from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is accustomed </span>to buy <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to him: Give me </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one dove or one pigeon. </span>He may also visit <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">baker </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he is accustomed </span>to buy <span class="gemarra-regular">and say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: Give me one loaf or one cake </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eluska</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one may go on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">to a grocer </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">whom he is accustomed </span>to buy <span class="gemarra-regular">and say to him: Give me twenty eggs, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or fifty nuts, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">ten peaches, or five pomegranates, or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, provided that he does not mention any measure. </span>In other words, he must not specify a unit of measurement, e.g., a <span class="it-text">kav</span>; rather, he must state a number, which is not the usual manner of making a purchase. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span>This is permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not mention the amount of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that he must not mention the sum of money that he is spending, but rather he must take what he needs and after the Festival they will calculate how much he owes.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brings wine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">jug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">place to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not bring </span>a large number of <span class="gemarra-regular">them in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">basket or in a tub </span>in the usual weekday manner on a Festival, as this is disrespectful of the Festival; <span class="gemarra-regular">but he may bring </span>one or two barrels <span class="gemarra-regular">on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoulder or </span>carry them <span class="gemarra-regular">in front of himself.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is impossible to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">modify </span>the manner in which one carries a vessel, whether due to the vessel or due to time constraints, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted </span>to act in the typical weekday manner.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava instituted </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>his city, <span class="gemarra-regular">Meḥoza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> One <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>usually <span class="gemarra-regular">carries</span> his burden <span class="gemarra-regular">with difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> on a weekday <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>modify his habit on a Festival and <span class="gemarra-regular">carry it on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pitchfork. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>usually<span class="gemarra-regular"> carries it on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pitchfork should carry it on a carrying pol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> held by two people on their shoulders. One <span class="gemarra-regular">who carries it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on a carrying pole </span>held by two people on their shoulders <span class="gemarra-regular">should carry it </span>on a carrying pole <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hands, </span>although he is not thereby making it easier for himself. One <span class="gemarra-regular">who carries </span>burdens on a carrying pole <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his hands should spread a scarf [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sudara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over it. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is not possibl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to make these modifications due to time constraints, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to proceed in the usual manner, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master said above: If it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is impossible to modify, it is permitted.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Rava said to Rav Ashi: The Sages said: As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> much as it is possible to modify </span>the weekday manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">one should modify on a Festival. </span>A question was asked of Rav Ashi: <span class="gemarra-regular">But don’t those women fill </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their jug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with water on a Festival without modifying, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we say nothing to them </span>by way of protest; why do we not instruct them to alter their usual manner? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not possible</span> for them to fill their jugs any other way. <span class="gemarra-regular">How</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should they act? </span>She <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>is accustomed to <span class="gemarra-regular">filling a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large jug, should </span>she instead <span class="gemarra-regular">fill a small jug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Won’t this mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">she increases </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">walking, </span>since she has to make more than one trip to bring home more than one jug, and she will thereby perform unnecessary labor on the Festival? 
If one were to suggest the opposite, <span class="gemarra-regular">that one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fills a small jug should fill a large jug, </span>won’t this mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">she increases </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">load? </span>Furthermore, if one were to suggest that <span class="gemarra-regular">she should cover </span>the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">cover, sometimes </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">fall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">might come to bring it </span>by hand, in the manner of a burden. <span class="gemarra-regular">Should she tie </span>the cover to the jug, the rope might <span class="gemarra-regular">occasionally break, and she might come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to tie it, </span>a prohibited labor. Finally, <span class="gemarra-regular">should she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spread a scarf over it, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">occasionally </span>falls off and <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes soaked in water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and she might come to </span>transgress the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">squeezing. Therefore, it is not possible </span>to make a modification, and those women may act in the regular manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanin said to Abaye: We learned </span>in a mishna: The Rabbis decreed that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not clap, nor strik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a hand on his thigh, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor dance </span>on a Festival, lest he come to repair musical instruments. <span class="gemarra-regular">But nowadays we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">see that </span>women <span class="gemarra-regular">do so, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say anything to them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: And according to your reasoning, </span>how do you explain <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: A person should not sit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at the entrance </span>to an alleyway, next to <span class="gemarra-regular">the side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post </span>that has been placed at the edge of an alleyway in order for it to be considered a private domain, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps an object </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">roll </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">from him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he will come to carry it four cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the public domain, </span>thereby transgressing a biblical prohibition? <span class="gemarra-regular">But don</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t these women take their jugs, and go, and sit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the entrance to an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and we do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not say anything to them?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the accepted principle is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Leave </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews</span> alone; <span class="gemarra-regular">it is better that they be unwitting sinners </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and not be intentional sinners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If people engage in a certain behavior that cannot be corrected, it is better not to reprove them, as they are likely to continue regardless of the reproof, and then they will be sinning intentionally. It is therefore preferable for them to be unaware that they are violating a prohibition and remain merely unwitting sinners. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>with regard to clapping and dancing, <span class="gemarra-regular">leave</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews </span>alone; <span class="gemarra-regular">it is better that they be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unwitting sinners and not be intentional sinners.</span>
The Gemara comments: There were those who understood that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only to rabbinic </span>prohibitions <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>not to <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah </span>prohibitions, with regard to which the transgressors must be reprimanded. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, this is not so; </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different</span> whether the prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah </span>law <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>whether it is <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span>law, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say anything </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them. </span>For example, on the eve of Yom Kippur, there is an obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one begin the fast while it is still day, before sunset, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the extension of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> During this time, one must observe all the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. This mitzva of extending Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">is by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah </span>law, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet people <span class="gemarra-regular">eat and drink until darkness</span> falls <span class="gemarra-regular">but we do not say anything to them, </span>as we know they will pay no attention.
It is taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may begin </span>taking straw <span class="gemarra-regular">from the pile of straw. Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kahana said: That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may begin </span>removing items <span class="gemarra-regular">from a storeroom </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Although the items in this storeroom are designated for other purposes, it is not assumed that one put them out of his mind. If so, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who is not </span>of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">set-aside [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>According to him, on Shabbat and Festivals it is not prohibited to handle items that one has removed from his mind.
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the same mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not wood in the </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">storage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have come to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda, who is </span>of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, we are dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>wood of <span class="gemarra-regular">cedars and firs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are expensive and used only in the construction of important buildings, not for kindling; the wood storage is therefore considered <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary loss. </span>With regard to an item that one removes from his mind due to the financial loss he might suffer were he to use it, but not due to any prohibition involved, <span class="gemarra-regular">even Rabbi Shimon concedes </span>that it may not be handled due to the prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who taught </span>the statement of Rav Kahana as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter clause</span> of the mishna, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not wood from the</span> wood <span class="gemarra-regular">storage </span>area. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: That is to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not begin </span>removing items <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">storeroom </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If so, in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who is </span>maintains that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause </span>of the mishna, which states that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may begin </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">from the pile of straw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have come to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the first clause of the mishna, it is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with straw </span>that has rotted <span class="gemarra-regular">and become rancid. </span>Since it is no longer fit as animal fodder, even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that it will be used for kindling and is not <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t rancid straw fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for clay </span>in the making of bricks; why can one assume that it will be used as fuel? The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring to straw <span class="gemarra-regular">that has thorns</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which cannot be kneaded into clay. It will certainly be used only for kindling. 

Daf 30b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not take wood from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> on any Festival, not only on the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, because this is considered dismantling, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>one may take <span class="gemarra-regular">from near it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question with regard to the mishna: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different? </span>Why did the mishna teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> itself one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>remove wood? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">dismantles a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a prohibited labor. But if so, if one takes wood <span class="gemarra-regular">from near it, too, </span>doesn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">dismantle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a tent? </span>Why, then, does the mishna permit him to do so?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Near </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">near the walls. </span>Wood placed near the walls may be removed because it is not part of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> itself; the walls themselves may not be removed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Menashya said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the wood <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">near the walls </span>but is part of the roof of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">when that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught, it was </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to bundle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of reeds that are not considered part of the roof of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, as they have not been untied. Therefore, one may remove them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan: One may not take wood from the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> itself <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the nearby </span>wood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon permits</span> one to take wood from the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> all <span class="gemarra-regular">agree, </span>even Rabbi Shimon, that with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> that was built for the <span class="gemarra-regular">festival </span>of<span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Festival it is prohibited </span>to remove wood from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>at the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">one stipulated </span>a condition <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to it </span>allowing him to use it for other purposes, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">all according to his stipulation. </span>
The Gemara questions this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon permit </span>one to take wood from the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> itself? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t one dismantling a tent, </span>which is a prohibited labor? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yitzḥak said: Here, we are dealing with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> that has already <span class="gemarra-regular">collapsed. </span>Therefore, the only potential concern is <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, not dismantling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he is not </span>of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a wick in oil was lit before Shabbat, and it went out on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">the remainder of the oil in a lam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bowl is prohibited </span>for use, as it is <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon permits </span>one to use it. Consequently, Rabbi Shimon also permits one to take wood from the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>.
The Gemara rejects this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it comparable? There, </span>in the case of oil in a lamp, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person sits and anticipate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when his lamp </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will be extinguished. </span>It is clear to him that it will be extinguished, and he can safely assume that a certain amount of oil will remain in the lamp or the bowl. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>however, can it be said that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person sits and anticipates when his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will fall? </span>He cannot know ahead of time that his <span class="it-text">sukka</span> will collapse. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Here, we are dealing with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sturdy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as from yesterday, </span>the Festival eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">had his mind on it. </span>He thought it might collapse, and therefore he did not remove the possibility of using its wood from his mind.
§ The above <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">All agree with regard to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> that was built for the <span class="gemarra-regular">festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, that <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival it is prohibited </span>to remove wood from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if one stipulated </span>a condition <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">all according to his condition. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is a condition effective with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">it?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Sheshet say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Akiva: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the wood of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to be used for any other use <span class="gemarra-regular">all seven </span>days of the Festival? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “The festival </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven days” </span>(Leviticus 23:34). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in explanation of this that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that just as the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven takes effect upon the Festival peace-offering, so too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, does the name of Heaven take effect upon the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? The verse states: “The festival of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, seven days” </span>(Leviticus 23:34), from which it is learned: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as the Festival </span>offering is consecrated <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Lord, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so too, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> is consecrated <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Lord. </span>Since the wood of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is compared to consecrated objects, how may one stipulate a condition with regard to it?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Menashya, son of Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>where the stipulation is mentioned, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived at </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a regular </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a hut used throughout the year, not specifically for the Festival. With regard to such a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, one may stipulate to use the wood as he wishes; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of mitzva, </span>used for the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">a condition</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not effective with regard to it. </span>
The Gemara asks a question from a different angle: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>a condition <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>effective for <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of mitzva? But isn’t it taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: In the case of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one roofed in accordance with its </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and decorated it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with embroidered </span>clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">and with patterned sheets, and hung on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it nuts, almonds, peaches, pomegranates, and vines [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parkilei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grapes </span>and glass containers filled with <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, oil, and flour, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wreaths of ears of corn </span>for decoration, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to derive benefit </span>from any of these <span class="gemarra-regular">until the conclusion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the last Festival day. But if one stipulated </span>a condition <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to them </span>whereby he allows himself to use them, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">all according to his condition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This shows that conditions are effective even with regard to a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> of mitzva.
The Gemara answers based on the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rava, who both say </span>that this is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one says: I am not removing </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">from them throughout twilight. </span>In other words, he announces from the outset that he will not set them aside as <span class="it-text">sukka</span> decorations, but rather he will use them for other purposes as well. In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">no sanctity devolves upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>at all, and he may therefore use them throughout the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>as for the actual <span class="gemarra-regular">wood of a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctity devolves upon it </span>through the very construction of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>has therefore been <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span>from use <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the entire <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way is it <span class="gemarra-regular">different </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from that which was stated </span>with regard to a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: In the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">separated seven </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrogi</span><span class="gemarra-italic">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>each of <span class="gemarra-regular">the seven </span>Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">days, </span>one for each day, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: He fulfills </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">through each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and every one </span>of them when he recites the blessing over the <span class="it-text">lulav</span> and <span class="it-text">etrog</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if he so desires <span class="gemarra-regular">he may eat it immediately </span>after the blessing. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Asi said: He fulfills </span>his obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">through each one, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may eat it the following day, </span>as it retains its sanctity for the duration of that entire day. In any case, all agree that the sanctity of each <span class="it-text">etrog</span> does not extend to the following day. If so, why does the sanctity of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> extend through all seven days?
The Gemara answers: There is a difference between an <span class="it-text">etrog</span> and a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to an <span class="it-text">etrog</span>, the <span class="gemarra-regular">nights are divide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the days, </span>as the mitzva of <span class="it-text">etrog</span> applies only during the day and not at night. This means that <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every day is its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> own mitzva, </span>and therefore an item that is sanctified for one day is not necessarily sanctified for the following day. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">nights</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not divided from the days, </span>as the mitzva of <span class="it-text">sukka</span> applies at night as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>seven <span class="gemarra-regular">days are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> considered as one long day. </span>Throughout the Festival, there is no moment during which the sanctity of <span class="it-text">sukka</span> leaves the wood; it leaves only at the conclusion of the Festival.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may bring wood </span>chopped from a tree the previous day <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>an unfenced <span class="gemarra-regular">field, </span>but only <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which has been gathered </span>into a pile before the Festival for the purpose of using it for kindling. However, scattered wood is <span class="it-text">muktze</span> and may not be handled. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if one brings wood <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> used for storage, he may bring <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the scattered </span>wood, as it is considered a guarded courtyard rather than a field, and one does not remove even scattered items from his mind if they are stored inside such an enclosure. The mishna explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">that is near a city, </span>but if it is far from a city, it is considered a field; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: Any </span>fenced place <span class="gemarra-regular">into which one </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with a key </span>is a <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is located at a distance from a city, provided that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">within the Shabbat limit.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: One may not bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wood except from </span>the wood that was <span class="gemarra-regular">gathered in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn</span> in the mishna: And <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even from scattered</span> wood? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>follows <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual </span>opinion. 
One may not rely on it, as is clear from a different source that the majority view is otherwise, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hillel did not disagree with regard to </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">scattered in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fields that one may not bring </span>it on a Festival to one’s house for kindling, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with regard to</span> wood <span class="gemarra-regular">gathered in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one may bring </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what did they disagree? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to scattered </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and gathered </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">in fields, as Beit Shammai say: He may not bring</span> it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: He may bring </span>it. Although the lenient opinion with regard to gathered wood in a field is attributed to Beit Hillel, this is only according to the minority view of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. However, most Sages disagree and say that one may not bring wood from a field at all, even according to Beit Hillel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">reed leaves and vine leaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> although they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are gathered </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed </span>in the same spot, <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if a wind comes it will scatter them, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span> already <span class="gemarra-regular">considered scattered and are </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>Given that they are likely to be scattered in the wind, one does not intend to use them. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if one placed a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vessel on them the day before </span>to prevent their being scattered in the wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">it seems well </span>and is permitted. 
The mishna discussed the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Rabbi Yehuda states that it is any enclosure that is near a city, while in Rabbi Yosei’s opinion it is any fenced place into which one can enter only with a key, provided that it is within the Shabbat limit of a city. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking? </span>Does Rabbi Yehuda mean to say that a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">that is near a city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> provided that it has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a key, </span>otherwise it is not a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> at all; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yosei comes to say: Since it has a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">key, even </span>if it is not near a city, as long as it is <span class="gemarra-regular">within the Shabbat limit </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>considered a <span class="it-text">karpe</span><span class="it-text">f</span>? According to this understanding, Rabbi Yosei’s view is more lenient than that of Rabbi Yehuda. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps this is what </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Any </span>enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">that is near a city</span> is a <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it has a key or does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not have a key, and Rabbi Yosei comes to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to the distance, it is a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> if it is not near a city, provided that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">within the Shabbat limit, but specifically if it has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a key. However, if it does not have a key</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">near a city </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>considered a <span class="it-text">karpef</span>. According to this understanding, the opinion of Rabbi Yosei is not necessarily the more lenient one; rather, for him the defining issue is whether or not there is a key, regardless of distance. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">into which one enters with a key, even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">within the Shabbat limit, </span>and he does not say: If one enters, but rather: Any place into which one enters, it shows that the key is not the determining factor. One may <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei stated two </span>conditions <span class="gemarra-regular">as leniencies. </span>In other words, he is not more stringent than Rabbi Yehuda in any situation; he is lenient in all cases. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that this is the case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Salla said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yirmeya said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei as a leniency; </span>Rabbi Yosei should be understood in this manner, and one should rule accordingly. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not chop wood </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">neither from beams</span> intended for construction <span class="gemarra-regular">nor from a beam that broke on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival, </span>although it no longer serves any purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may not chop </span>wood on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an ax, nor with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">saw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sickle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as these are clearly craftsman’s tools used on weekdays. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, one may </span>chop only <span class="gemarra-regular">with a cleaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Using this tool differs greatly from the weekday manner in which wood is chopped. 

Daf 31b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara wonders at the wording of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t you say in the first clause </span>of the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not chop </span>beams <span class="gemarra-regular">at all</span> on a Festival, ostensibly due to the extra effort involved? Why, then, does the mishna later define how one may chop, and even permit the use of a cleaver? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and is teaching the following: One may not chop </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">from the pile of beams </span>intended for construction, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a beam that broke on the Festival </span>itself, as it is considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one may chop </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">beam that broke on the eve of the Festival, </span>since it has presumably been designated as firewood.
Yet even <span class="gemarra-regular">when one chop</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> such a beam, it must not be done in the weekday manner; an adjustment must be made. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not chop </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">neither with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an ax</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor with a saw, nor with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sickle, but with a cleaver. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>opinion, which is in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not chop</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wood, neither from the pile of beams nor from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beam that broke on the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not considered prepared.</span>
It is taught in the mishna that even when it is permitted to chop wood on a Festival, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>do so <span class="gemarra-regular">with an ax. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelemya said in the name of Rav: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They taught </span>this prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case where one chops <span class="gemarra-regular">with its female </span>side, i.e., the broad side of the ax, as was normally done. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one chops <span class="gemarra-regular">with its male </span>side, i.e., the narrow side, this <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>because it is an unusual manner of chopping. 
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that one may do so in this unusual fashion, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna that it is permitted to chop <span class="gemarra-regular">with a cleaver, </span>and chopping with the narrow side of an ax is similar to chopping with a cleaver. The Gemara explains: It was necessary to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: This applies only</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cleaver, </span>as it is narrow on both sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to a tool that is <span class="gemarra-regular">an ax</span> on one side <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">a cleaver </span>on the other, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Since this side, </span>that which is like an ax, <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, the other, side, </span>which is like a cleaver, should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>Rav therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>that the cleaver side is in fact permitted. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some teach this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> in relation <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, with a cleaver. Rav Ḥinnana bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shelemya said in the name of Rav: They taught </span>that it is permitted to chop wood on a Festival from a beam that was broken the day before, as stated previously, when one does so <span class="gemarra-regular">only with its male </span>side; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he chops <span class="gemarra-regular">with its female </span>side, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>The Gemara challenges: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>Didn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>in the mishna that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ax? </span>The Gemara answers: It was necessary to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: This </span>prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ax, but </span>with regard to a utensil that is both <span class="gemarra-regular">an ax and a cleaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that is broad on one side and narrow on the other, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Since this side, </span>the narrower one, <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the other, </span>broader <span class="gemarra-regular">side </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>Rav therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that they did not permit one side due to the other. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a house that is filled with produce </span>and locked on all sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a hole </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in one of its walls or its roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may remove</span> produce <span class="gemarra-regular">through the place of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hole</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The produce is not considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, even though one cannot reach it without the existence of the hole. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may even make a hole </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and take </span>produce through that opening. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara wonders at Rabbi Meir’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>does he permit one to make a hole in order to remove the produce <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>one who does so <span class="gemarra-regular">dismantling</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tent, </span>thereby performing a biblically prohibited labor? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥumi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Adda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>Here, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to bricks </span>placed <span class="gemarra-regular">one on top of the other [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aveira</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">delivni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> but not cemented together. This is not considered a building at all. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But didn’t Rav Naḥman say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bricks </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remainin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from a building, it is permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handle them on Shabbat, since they are fit to sit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on; </span>however, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one arranged them </span>in rows, one on top of the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has certainly set them aside </span>from his intentions? This indicates that even bricks placed on top of one another without being cemented together are nonetheless considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>Rabbi Meir was referring to a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">On a Festival they said </span>that one may do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>allow it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat </span>even in such a manner, and Rav Naḥman was speaking of Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">was also taught </span>explicitly in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: One may even make a hole </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and remove </span>the produce from inside; <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>this with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, but not</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">fastenings </span>made of knotted ropes <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>are attached <span class="gemarra-regular">to the groun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and that serve as closures for doors of cellars and caves, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> untie </span>the knot, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one may not unrave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> the rope itself into its constituent fibers <span class="gemarra-regular">nor cut </span>the rope. This constitutes the prohibited labor of dismantling the cellar or cave on Shabbat. With regard to fastenings <span class="gemarra-regular">that are on </span>the doors of <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., cupboards, it is permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">untie, or unravel, or cut </span>them if necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, </span>as the prohibition against dismantling does not apply to vessels. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">fastenings that </span>are attached <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ground, </span>which are on doors, <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">untie </span>the rope <span class="gemarra-regular">but not unravel or cut </span>it. Although it is permitted to do so by Torah law, the Sages prohibited it. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, one may untie </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or unravel or cut </span>it, as this is not prohibited even by rabbinic law. This appears to contradict the opinion of Shmuel, who does not differentiate between Shabbat and Festivals. 
Shmuel could respond: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who said: One may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even make a hole and remove </span>produce <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whereas</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis disagree with him </span>and prohibit it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spoke in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do the Rabbis disagree with him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>doors <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed to the ground? But isn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis concede to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir with regard to </span>doors <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed to the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one may untie </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat but not unravel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or cut </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">while on a Festival one may untie</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or unravel or cut </span>them? 

Daf 32a

The Gemara responds: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">he, </span>Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spoke in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fastenings that are to the ground, </span>e.g., those on doors, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may untie </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">but not unravel or cut </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival. And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>fastenings <span class="gemarra-regular">of a vessel, on Shabbat one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may untie </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one may not unravel or cut </span>them; <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival one may untie, or unravel, or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cut </span>them. 
The Gemara challenges further: <span class="gemarra-regular">You have </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">answered the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first clause </span>of Shmuel’s statement, with regard to fastenings attached to the ground, e.g., those on doors, by finding a <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who permits untying them, as does Shmuel. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, the latter clause </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>because the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that one may not unravel even ropes of vessels on Shabbat, whereas Shmuel permits unraveling in all cases. 
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Neḥemya, </span>whose opinion is a minority view, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: All vessels may be handled only in the manner </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of their </span>designated <span class="gemarra-regular">use. </span>Therefore, the rope may not be cut, not because it is prohibited to unravel it but because one may not handle a knife for this purpose, as the designated use of the knife is cutting food rather than rope. 
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya, why </span>discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">particularly Shabbat? </span>The same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should apply <span class="gemarra-regular">even on a Festival, </span>as there is no distinction between Shabbat and Festivals with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of handling items. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a distinction </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Neḥemya between a rabbinic decree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Shabbat, </span>when a vessel may be moved only for its designated purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a rabbinic decree of a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when it may not be moved for any purpose, there is a problem. <span class="gemarra-regular">Does he differentiate </span>between them in this manner? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: On a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">one may kindle </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">with vessels, but one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not kindle </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">with shards of vessels, </span>as they are <span class="it-text">muktze</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may kindle </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">both with vessels and with shards </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of vessels. And it is taught </span>in yet <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may kindle </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">neither with vessels nor with shards</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of vessels. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is resolved </span>in the following manner: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; this </span>first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who accepts the law of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. One may therefore kindle fire with vessels, as they are not <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, but not with shards of vessels, as they are <span class="it-text">muktze</span> and may not be handled. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who does not accept the law of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. According to him, one may use shards of vessels as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one that prohibits using even vessels that are intact is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who allows vessels to be used only for their designated purpose. This indicates that Rabbi Neḥemya prohibits handling even whole vessels on Festivals as well. 
The Gemara replies: These are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> who both hold <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya. </span>Two later <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagreed with each other in reporting the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya. Both agree that one may use vessels only for their designated purpose, but they disagree with regard to whether this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies only on Shabbat or on Festivals as well.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not hollow out </span>a piece of clay to form <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> into which he will place oil and a wick <span class="gemarra-regular">because he </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">creates a vessel. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not produce </span><span class="gemarra-regular">charcoa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> at all <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival </span>because this is not labor for sustenance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not cut the wick, </span>as this is considered mending a vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If one requires a wick of a particular length, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may cut it</span> by burning it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a fire </span>but not by cutting it with a knife.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">hollowing out a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered creating <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel, </span>even if it is not fired in a furnace? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: It is Rabbi Meir, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity: <span class="gemarra-regular">From when is an earthenware vessel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">susceptible to ritual impurity? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">from when its work </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">completed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., when the clay has been made into the form of a vessel; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">is fired in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furnace.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: From where </span>do you conclude that this is the same opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Rabbi Meir stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>with regard to vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">since they are fit to contain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">something. </span>Although they cannot hold liquids before being fired in a furnace, they can contain other items. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this lamp <span class="gemarra-regular">fit? </span>The Gemara responds: It can be used <span class="gemarra-regular">to contain </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">coins</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>the following version of the discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as we learned: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥaraniyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pots [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ilpasin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> are unfinished earthenware pots made together with their covers. The covers are removed after they are fired in a furnace. They are <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>with regard to contracting the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">of a tent over a corpse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they do not have a receptacle. Earthenware vessels can contract impurity imparted by a corpse only if they have a hollow space that can contain something. But <span class="it-text">ḥaraniyyot</span> pots are rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">impure by the carrying of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even if the <span class="it-text">zav</span> moved them without actually touching them, as this impurity applies to any earthenware vessels that serve some purpose.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: </span>These vessels are <span class="gemarra-regular">even pure</span> with regard to the impurity imparted by the <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because their labor is not completed; </span>therefore, they are not fully formed. This implies that when the pots are completed, they are considered full-fledged vessels, even before they have been fired in a furnace. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: Perhaps </span>it is not so, as it is possible to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Tzadok, stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>in the case of <span class="it-text">ḥaraniyyot</span> pots, <span class="gemarra-regular">since they are fit to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contain something. But here, </span>in the case of a lamp, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">fit? </span>The Gemara replies: It is fit <span class="gemarra-regular">to contain </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">coins.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One may not hollow out a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lamp, and one may not create </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaraniyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pots on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel permits </span>creating <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaraniyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pots. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaraniyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said: </span>They are pots <span class="gemarra-regular">of a city [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">iraniyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>The Gemara again inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">iraniyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye said: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">villager</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s’ </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bowls </span>who will use even clay vessels that have not been fully formed or fired, as they are not particular with regard to half-finished utensils.
It is taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">produce charcoa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> on a Festival. The Gemara challenges: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that one may perform only labor for sustenance. <span class="gemarra-regular">For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>charcoal <span class="gemarra-regular">fit; </span>what purpose does it have for the sake of sustenance? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: It is necessary</span> to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">handing</span> the charcoal <span class="gemarra-regular">over to bathhouse attendants [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">olyarin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> who heat up the bathhouse <span class="gemarra-regular">for that day. </span>One might have thought that since charcoal is used for the sake of washing on a Festival, producing it should be permitted. 
The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And on that day is it permitted </span>to heat up water for washing? The Sages decreed that one may not wash in a bathhouse on a Festival, even if the water was heated up the day before, and certainly it is prohibited if the water was heated on the Festival itself. The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rava said </span>with regard to a different issue, this decree does not refer to actual washing but to entering a bathhouse merely in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to sweat, and </span>it was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the enactment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>against sweating in a bathhouse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>one can explain that the statement of Rabbi Ḥiyya is referring to a case where one entered <span class="gemarra-regular">to sweat, and </span>he entered at a time <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>was enacted.
It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not cut a wick into two, </span>but Rabbi Yehuda permits cutting it by means of fire. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>about cutting a wick with fire as opposed to with a knife, <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not </span>cut a wick <span class="gemarra-regular">with a knife? </span>

Daf 32b

 Is it because <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">mends a vessel? </span>If so, when one cuts it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the fire, he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also preparing a vessel </span>for use. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya taught </span>in explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">He cuts it by fir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the mouth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of two candles. </span>In other words, he does not simply cut a wick, but rather inserts a long wick into two lamps, which he subsequently lights in the middle. This indeed leads to the formation of two separate wicks, but only as a result of kindling two lamps. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Natan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One may </span><span class="gemarra-italic">moḥet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival. </span>The term <span class="it-text">moḥet</span> was unknown, and the Gemara therefore asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-italic">moḥet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Ḥanina bar Shelemya said in the name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav: To remove the dark</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> in other words, it is permitted to remove the burnt, charcoaled section to make the lamp shine more brightly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Bar Kappara taught: Six matters were stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wick </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">are to be stringent and three</span> of which <span class="gemarra-regular">are to be lenient</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The three <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to be stringent </span>are: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not spin </span>or twist <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a Festival, and one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> singe it in fire </span>before lighting it so that it will burn well, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may not cut it into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two. </span>The three <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lenient </span>are: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may crush it by hand, </span>as although it is prohibited to twist it into a wick, one may adjust its shape in an unusual manner; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may soak it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in oil </span>so that it will later burn well; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may cut it by fire in the mouth of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two candles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ After citing one teaching in the name of Rav Natan bar Abba, the Gemara quotes a few more statements attributed to the same scholar. Since he is not mentioned often, Rav Natan’s teachings are arranged together, so that they can be remembered more easily. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Natan bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The wealthy </span>Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">of Babylonia will descend to Gehenna </span>because they do not have compassion on others. This is illustrated by incidents <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this: Shabbetai bar Marinu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> happened</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to come to Babylonia. He requested </span>their participation in <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> business venture, </span>to lend him money and receive half the profits in return, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they did not give </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>Furthermore, when he asked them <span class="gemarra-regular">to sustain him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with food, they likewise refused to sustain him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said: These </span>wealthy people are not descendants of our forefathers, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they came from the mixed multitude, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “And show you compassion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and have compassion </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon you, </span>and multiply you, as He has sworn to your fathers” (Deuteronomy 13:18), from which it is derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has compassion </span>for God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creatures, it is known that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is of the descendants of Abraham, our father, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anyone who does not have compassion </span>for God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">creatures</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is known that he is not of the descendants</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Abraham, our father. </span>Since these wealthy Babylonians do not have compassion on people, clearly they are not descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
This is another teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Natan bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Whoever looks to the table</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of others </span>for his sustenance, <span class="gemarra-regular">the world is dark for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him. </span>Everything looks bleak and hopeless to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">for it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “He wanders abroad for bread: Where is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? He knows the day of darkness is ready at his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hand” </span>(Job 15:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: Even his life </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is no life, </span>as he receives no satisfaction from it.
In support of this last claim, the Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>whose <span class="gemarra-regular">lives are not lives, and they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are as follows: One who looks to the table of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">others </span>for his sustenance; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one whose wife rules </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">him; and one whose body is ruled by suffering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say: Even one who has only one robe. </span>Since he cannot wash it properly, he suffers from lice and dirt. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who did not include such a person, maintains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is possible</span> for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to examine his clothes </span>and remove the lice, which would alleviate his suffering.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not break earthenware </span>on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not cut </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pape</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to roast salted </span>fish <span class="gemarra-regular">on it. </span>Earthenware shards or pieces of paper that have been soaked in water were placed on the metal surface or in the oven in which the fish was roasted, so that it would not be burned by the heat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sweep ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> anything that has fallen into <span class="gemarra-regular">an ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or stove </span>that interferes with the baking, such as plaster. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may press down </span>and flatten any accumulated dust and ashes at the bottom of the oven, which might prevent it from lighting properly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> draw two barrels together </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to place a pot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on them, </span>so that its contents will be cooked by a fire lit between the barrels. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prop a po</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that does not stand straight <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a piece of wood, </span>in order to prevent it from falling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, with a door. And one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lead an animal with a stick </span>in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival; and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, permits </span>it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the issue of breaking earthenware and cutting paper, the Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>for this prohibition? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because one </span>is thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">preparing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a vessel </span>for use.
It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not sweep out an oven or stove. Rabbi Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yosef taught before Rav Naḥman: And if it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not possible to bake unless one sweeps it out, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted. </span>The Gemara relates an incident with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wife of Rabbi Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A part of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brick fell into </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">oven on a Festival, </span>preventing her from baking. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya said to her: See, </span>you should know that <span class="gemarra-regular">I want good-quality bread. </span>He thereby stated that it would be impossible unless she removed the brick, making it permissible for her to do so. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to his attendant: Roast for me a duck </span>in an oven, <span class="gemarra-regular">and be careful not to singe </span>it. He thereby implied that the attendant may remove all impediments from the oven in order to fulfill this requirement because otherwise it would not be possible to cook without singeing.
In a related case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Rav Aḥa from Hutzal said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to us that the master, </span>Rav Ashi, allows his attendants <span class="gemarra-regular">to plaster </span>the mouth of <span class="gemarra-regular">the oven for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. </span>This was done in order to ensure that the roasted or cooked dish would be fully prepared. Why does this not constitute the prohibited labor of kneading on a Festival? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: We rely on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bank of the Euphrates </span>River. We avoid the labor of kneading by taking sufficiently kneaded mud from the riverbank. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this applies only when one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wrappe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> or made some mark on the mud <span class="gemarra-regular">the day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before, </span>so that it not be <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: And</span> as for kneading with <span class="gemarra-regular">ashes </span>for this purpose, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since the labor of kneading does not apply to ashes.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> draw two barrels together </span>in order to place a pot on them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>With regard to large <span class="gemarra-regular">stones</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a lavatory</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> upon which one sits to attend to his needs, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to put them together</span> in the proper manner, so that they may be used <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. Rabba raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Wasn’t it taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not draw two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> barrels together </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to place a pot on them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This seems to indicate that any arrangement resembling building is prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: There, </span>with regard to barrels, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different, because one makes a tent. </span>It is not the drawing of the barrels close together that is prohibited. Rather, the placement of the pot over them forms a kind of covering, which is similar to building a tent. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Younger, </span>so called to distinguish him from the more famous <span class="it-text">amora</span> known as Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Ashi: However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>then if, <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> built </span>a solid <span class="gemarra-regular">bench [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">itztaba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> without a gap below the seat, a situation in which <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not make</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tent, so too, </span>will you say <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted? He said to him: </span>The two cases are not comparable: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to a proper construction, such as a bench, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah prohibited </span>erecting <span class="gemarra-regular">a permanent construction, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah did not prohibit </span>erecting <span class="gemarra-regular">a temporary construction. The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">decreed against </span>creating <span class="gemarra-regular">a temporary construction </span>on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a permanent construction. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to a lavatory, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the dignity </span>of the user, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not decree with regard to it. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>With Regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this bonfire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which the wood is arranged in the form of a house, if one arranges it <span class="gemarra-regular">from above to below</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is permitted, </span>as this is not the regular manner of building. However, if one prepares it in the usual fashion, <span class="gemarra-regular">from below to above, it is prohibited, </span>for this is considered building. 

Daf 33a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>if one wishes to place <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs </span>on the mouth of a hollow vessel or on a grill sitting above coals, he must first hold the vessel in his hands and put the eggs on it, and only afterward position them both on the coals. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a po</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> placed on barrels, one must hold the pot above the barrels before placing them underneath it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> similarly, </span>in the case of a collapsible <span class="gemarra-regular">bed, </span>whose legs and cover are separate pieces, one must first stretch the upper part, then add the legs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">barrels </span>positioned one on top of the other, the upper one must be held in place first and then the others added below.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prop a pot with a piece of wood, and similarly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a door. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">door, </span>can this <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind? </span>Is it possible to prop a pot by means of a door? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>and correct the wording as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>one may not prop <span class="gemarra-regular">a door </span>with a piece of wood. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught: One may not prop a pot with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> piece of wood, and similarly a door, as wood is</span> to be used <span class="gemarra-regular">only for kindling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> With regard to any use other than kindling, wood is considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon, </span>who does not accept the prohibition of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>it.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not lead an animal with a stick on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, permits </span>it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">his father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">who is not </span>of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and he therefore permits one to take any stick and lead an animal with it? The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>there is no issue of <span class="it-text">muktze</span> here at all, for in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">even Rabbi Shimon concedes </span>to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> that this activity is prohibited, not due to <span class="it-text">muktze</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>one who does so <span class="gemarra-regular">looks like one who is going </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the market [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥinga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in the manner of a weekday. On a Festival, one must therefore lead the animal in an unusual fashion. 
§ In a case where one takes <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bambo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> branch to use as a skewer, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits it </span>because it is <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, since it was not made into a vessel the day before, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Sheshet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permits it. </span>The Gemara elaborates: In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wet </span>branch, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited; </span>it is unfit for kindling and is therefore <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a dry </span>branch. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span>handling it, Rav Naḥman, could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you: Wood is only for kindling, </span>but it is considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> with regard to any other use. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>handling it, Rav Sheshet, could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>Since all wood is to be used for roasting, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is it to me to roast with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>when it is inserted into meat? <span class="gemarra-regular">What is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to me to roast with its coals? </span>Just as it is permitted to burn the bamboo as coal, so it is permitted to use it as a skewer for cooking. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the explanation of this dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the case </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a dry </span>branch, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when they disagree, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the case of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wet </span>one. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span>handling it does so because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not fit for kindling. And the one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>it could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for a large fire, </span>which will dry out the branch and enable it to burn as well? The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a wet </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava taught: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A woman may not enter a storehouse of wood </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to take from them a firebrand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a partly burnt piece of wood used for turning over the wood of the bonfire, because this piece of wood was not made into a vessel the day before and it is therefore <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And a firebrand that broke may not be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kindled on a Festival, for one may kindle </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessels but one may not kindle </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">with shards of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessels, </span>and this firebrand was considered a vessel before it broke. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say that </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>of the opinion that there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But didn’t Rava say to his attendant: Roast </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a duck for me, and throw its innards </span>to the cat? According to Rabbi Yehuda, it is prohibited to give the innards to animals, as they were not prepared for this purpose the day before. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, since </span>the innards <span class="gemarra-regular">become rancid </span>when they were left, <span class="gemarra-regular">from yesterday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Festival eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">his mind was on them. </span>At that point in time, he already intended to give them to the cats in his house.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>On a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may remove a sliver </span>from a pile of straw or from similar material <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to clean with it </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">his teeth. And he may collect </span>straw <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard and kindle </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">for anything in a courtyard is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared </span>for all purposes. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis say: He may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">collect </span>these materials only <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>things placed <span class="gemarra-regular">before him </span>in his house, as they are certainly prepared for all uses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and kindle </span>them. With regard to objects lying in his courtyard, however, as their collection takes great effort, he certainly did not have them in mind the day before, and they are therefore <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. 
The mishna states a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not produce fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> neither from wood, </span>by rubbing one piece against another; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor from stones </span>knocked against each other; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor from </span>hot <span class="gemarra-regular">dirt; nor from tiles </span>struck against each other; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor from water </span>placed in round, glass vessels, which produces fire by focusing the rays of the sun. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not whiten tiles </span>with a burning-hot heat in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to roast upon them </span>afterward.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said:</span> 

Daf 33b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Animal fodder, </span>such as straw and reed branches, <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not have </span>any associated prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the preparing of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a vessel. </span>One may therefore trim it on Shabbat and use it as one wishes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana raised an objection to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may handle </span>wood of <span class="gemarra-regular">a spice tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> on Shabbat in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> smell them and to wave them before a sick person</span> to fan him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may crush it </span>between his fingers to release its fragrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he may smell it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not cut it </span>from the branch in order to produce a moist spot on the branch that will emit a strong fragrance, so as <span class="gemarra-regular">to smell it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and if he did cut it, he is exempt </span>from punishment according to Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it is prohibited </span>to do so. If he intends <span class="gemarra-regular">to clean his teeth with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, he may not cut it, and if he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cut it, he is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering</span> for transgressing a prohibited labor on Shabbat. This indicates that although some wood of a spice tree was used as animal fodder, it is nevertheless prohibited to cut it. This appears to contradict Rav Yehuda. 
Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Kahana: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>even the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt but prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to my </span>opinion, and it is not reasonable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it required </span>to say the opposite, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering? </span>This teaching cannot be understood at face value; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it must be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">When that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught, </span>it was referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">hard </span>pieces of wood such as beams, with regard to which there is a concern that one might perform a prohibited labor. The Gemara questions this: And can <span class="gemarra-regular">hard </span>branches <span class="gemarra-regular">be crushed </span>by hand? 
The Gemara replies: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and is teaching </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the following: </span>With regard to wood of a spice tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">crush it and smell it </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">cut i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and smell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? With regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to soft </span>pieces of wood, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to hard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ones, one may not cut them. And if he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cut it he is exempt, but it is prohibited </span>to do so. If he intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to clean his teeth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with it, he may not cut it, and if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did cut it, he is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering. </span>
Similarly, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may cut it and smell it, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not cut it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to smell it. Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">is not difficult. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, when it is permitted, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to soft </span>wood. In <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> prohibits it, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to har</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> pieces of wood.
With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objects to this: With hard ones, why not? </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from that which we learned</span> in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may break a barrel </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat dried figs from it, provided that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">intend to make a vessel, </span>and he may use the barrel afterward. Breaking off wood in order to smell it is certainly not more of a prohibited labor than breaking a barrel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Rav Adda and Ravin bar Rav Adda, who both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: When we were at the house of Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he would break and give us many sticks </span>of wood of a spice tree, although <span class="gemarra-regular">they were </span>hard enough to be <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for handles of axes and hatches. </span>
The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not difficult; this </span>case is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case follows <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>On Shabbat or a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may take a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sliver </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">from before him to clean his teeth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with it, and the Rabbis say: One may take </span>a toothpick <span class="gemarra-regular">only from an animal’s trough; </span>since it is fit for animal fodder, it is considered prepared for all purposes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they agree that he may not pluck it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And if he did pluck it to clean his teeth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with it </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>use it as a key and <span class="gemarra-regular">open a door with it, </span>if he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat, he is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally on a Festival, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">receives the forty </span>lashes administered to one who desecrates the Festival by performing labor. These are <span class="gemarra-regular">the words of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Both this and this, </span>whether one did so on Shabbat or a Festival, even if he plucked it by hand to use it as a key, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">only due to a rabbinic </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, who states there </span>that one who plucks a toothpick on Shabbat unwittingly in order to make a vessel such as a key is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of one who cuts a sliver of wood in order to smell it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, but it is prohibited. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis who state there, </span>in the case of plucking a toothpick, that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt but it is prohibited, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>when one cuts a sliver of wood for purposes of smelling, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer not accept this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may break a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> barre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat dried figs from it, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">intend to make a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessel? </span>This shows that if one does not intend to make a vessel, it is permitted <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>; whereas Rabbi Eliezer maintains that he is exempt, but it is prohibited. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: When that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught, </span>its lenient ruling was <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a vessel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">patched with pitch [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mustaki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning a vessel that had previously been broken and its pieces glued together with pitch. If one breaks it for his own needs, he does not smash a complete vessel, and he is therefore not considered to have fashioned a vessel.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may collect </span>straw <span class="gemarra-regular">from the courtyard </span>on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One may collect </span>materials <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and kindle </span>a fire because <span class="gemarra-regular">everything in a courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared, provided he does not arrange it in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> piles, and Rabbi Shimon permits </span>it even in such a manner. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree; </span>what is the basis of their dispute? <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the Rabbis, who are stringent, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: It looks</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as though he is collecting for tomorrow and another day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and it is therefore prohibited, so that one will not be suspected of preparing from a Festival to a weekday. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: His pot proves his</span> intention. When onlookers see that he is using the straw for cooking, they will not suspect him of preparing for after the Festival.
§ It is taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not produce </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">fire</span> on a Festival in any manner. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason </span>for this? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> create</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> something new <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. </span>This is similar to an act of creation, and it is therefore prohibited.
§ The mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not whiten tile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by heating them, in order to roast food on them. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does one </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">do; </span>since his intention is to prepare food, how does this differ from any other manner of roasting? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Here we are dealing with new tiles, </span>and it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>

Daf 34a

<span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary to test </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> to ensure that they do not burst when heated. If they are heated for the first time on a Festival, he will be thereby testing them, which is a prohibited labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say: Because it is necessary to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> harden them </span>by overheating them the first time to make them fit for use, which is considered preparing a vessel for use and is prohibited on a Festival. 
In relation to the above, the Gemara cites the following teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">trampled </span>fowl with his foot, <span class="gemarra-regular">or threw it </span>against a <span class="gemarra-regular">wall, or if an animal crushe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, </span>and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">twitching </span>but cannot stand; <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">waited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., remained alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>of the injury <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>twenty-four hours later, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered it, it is kosher, </span>provided no other defect is found in it that would have caused it to die within twelve months, which would render it a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar bar Yannai said in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Antigonus: It requires examination </span>after slaughtering, to make sure it does not have a defect. 
In relation to the same issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya inquired</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Zeira: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughtering it on a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Do we assume on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a Festival </span>that it has <span class="gemarra-regular">a flaw or not? </span>In other words, may one rely on the assumption that a typical chicken has no defect? Or perhaps, since there is concern with regard to this particular bird and it requires examination, one should refrain from slaughtering it lest it turn out to be a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span>. If so, he will have performed labor for no purpose. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not whiten tile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in order to <span class="gemarra-regular">roast on them. And we discussed it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: What does he </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">do? And Rabba bar bar Ḥana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Here we are dealing with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> new tiles, </span>and the Sages prohibited heating them <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>one first <span class="gemarra-regular">needs to test them, </span>and they might crack when heated. If they were heated for the first time on a Festival and cracked, it would show that they were unfit for use, in which case heating them would have been an unnecessary labor. This indicates that one may not take a chance on a Festival with regard to something that might be flawed, and therefore a possible <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> should be similarly prohibited. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: </span>This is no proof; <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>that the reason for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary to harden the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> in order to make them into proper vessels. Therefore, there is no connection between making a vessel and conducting an examination. Consequently, there is no reason to prohibit the slaughter of such a chicken on a Festival. 
It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is possible for several people to perform a single act of cooking on Shabbat, and all will be liable. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">One brings the fire, and one brings the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wood, and one places the pot </span>on the stove, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one brings the water </span>for the pot, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one puts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spices into </span>the food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one stir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the pot; <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are all liable </span>for cooking. The Gemara wonders at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the last one is liable and all </span>the rest <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt? </span>The Gemara responds: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is not difficult. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case, where all are liable, is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">in which he brought fire at the outset, </span>and therefore each of them performed part of the act of cooking; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where only the last one is liable, is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">in which he brought fire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at the end. </span>In that case, none of the earlier people performed any aspect of cooking at all, as the labor of cooking begins only from when fire is brought. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, all of them performed an action</span> that constitutes a prohibited labor, and they are therefore partners in a prohibited act and the desecration of Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who places the pot </span>on the stove, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>prohibited labor <span class="gemarra-regular">has he performed? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Here we are dealing with a new pot, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to whitening tiles they applied </span>the same prohibition to <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>This means that one is not liable for cooking the food in the pot but for strengthening the pot itself, as is the case with heating tiles.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">New ovens and stove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">similar to all vessels that </span>may be <span class="gemarra-regular">carried in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>on a Festival, as one can place items on them. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one may not anoint them with oil, nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rub them with a rag, nor cool them with cold </span>liquids to prevent them from overheating, as all these actions are considered preparing the vessel for use, which may not be done on a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>one did so <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to bake </span>in the oven on the Festival itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is permitted.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: During a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may scald the head and the feet </span>of a slaughtered animal with hot water in order to remove the hairs from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one may singe them in fire </span>for this purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one may not smear them with clay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor earth, nor lime </span>in order to remove the hairs because this involves great effort, and it appears as though he is processing the skin. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not shear </span>those hairs <span class="gemarra-regular">with scissors, </span>as it appears as though he is performing the labor of shearing in an effort to obtain the hairs themselves. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> trim </span>the top of the leaves connected to <span class="gemarra-regular">the vegetable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with its </span>special <span class="gemarra-regular">shears</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but one may prepare </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kunda</span><span class="gemarra-italic">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">akaviyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>bitter vegetables that can be eaten only after extensive cooking, although this involves great effort. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may kindle </span>fire <span class="gemarra-regular">and bake in a large baker’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> oven [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">purnei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one may heat water in an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">antikhi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a kind of large urn, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one may not bake</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a new baker’s ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lest it break. </span>If the oven cracks when heated because it was not properly made, one will have performed unnecessary work on a Festival. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span> similarly in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not blow </span>a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">with bellows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because this is the manner of a weekday activity, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one may blow </span>a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a tube, </span>in an unusual manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mend a skewer nor sharpen it. The Sages </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not break a reed </span>in order to make a kind of skewer upon which <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> roast salted </span>fish, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one may crack a nut </span>covered <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there is no concern lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it tear, </span>for even if this occurs, no prohibited labor has been performed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Eliezer further </span><span class="gemarra-regular">state</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the following leniency: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may stand over </span>objects in <span class="gemarra-regular">storage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such as produce that he has for some reason previously set aside from use, 

Daf 34b

<span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat eve during the Sabbatical Year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> during which no tithes are separated, which means one may take fruit on the following day without the need for any corrective measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say: From here, </span>from these fruits, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat tomorrow. And the Rabbis say: </span>He may not eat <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he mark</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the pile of fruit the day before <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">says: From here to there </span>I will take.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there: Children who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">figs </span>for themselves in a field <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in order to eat them on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they forgot and did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not separate tithes, </span>not only are they prohibited from eating them on Shabbat, for eating on Shabbat is always considered a fixed meal that obligates the produce in tithes, but even <span class="gemarra-regular">after the conclusion of Shabbat, they may not eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until they have separated tithes. And we also learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who transfers figs in his courtyard in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> order to </span>make them into <span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>figs, <span class="gemarra-regular">his children and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the members of his household may </span>in the meantime <span class="gemarra-regular">partake</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a casual </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are exempt</span> from tithes. The fact that the fruit has reached his courtyard, as opposed to his house, is not enough to cause it to be liable for tithing.
Based on these two sources, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava inquired of Rav Naḥman: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in terms of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it establish</span>es an obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to tithe </span>food that has been <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> on Shabbat? Specifically, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> item whose labor has not been completed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>does the fact that the food is <span class="it-text">muktze</span> on Shabbat give it the status of completely prepared food, or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is written: “And call Shabbat a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> delight” </span>(Isaiah 58:13), this implies that any food one eats on Shabbat is considered a delight and not a casual meal, and therefore Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes </span>an obligation to tithe, as if the food were fully completed and fit to be eaten as a fixed meal, <span class="gemarra-regular">even for an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">item that has not </span>had its <span class="gemarra-regular">labor completed? Or perhaps </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes </span>an obligation to tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">an item whose labor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is completed, </span>but regarding <span class="gemarra-regular">an item whose labor is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">completed it does not establish </span>an obligation to tithe? 
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat establishes </span>the obligation for tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an item whose work</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is completed and things whose work is not completed. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Naḥman and challenged: <span class="gemarra-regular">But say </span>that the law of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>should be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard: Just as a courtyard establishes </span>food placed inside it as a fixed meal with regard to tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">the work on an item is completed, so too,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">establish only an item whose work is completed</span> as liable for tithing. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: I did not say this based on my own logic, which can be countered by logic of your own. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have it as an ordered teaching that Shabbat establishes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">both things whose work is completed and things whose work </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not completed. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman, said: We, too, have learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Eliezer further stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stand over </span>objects in the <span class="gemarra-regular">storage </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat eve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">during the Sabbatical Year </span>and say: I will eat from here and here. <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason is that </span>it is fruit of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical Year, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not obligated to </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes. However, if </span>it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the other years of the Sabbatical </span>cycle, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>you will say that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to eat them without separating tithes. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not because Shabbat establishes </span>them with regard to tithes, and consequently they not be eaten until tithes have been separated? 
The Gemara refutes this: This is no proof, for <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is different: Since he said: From here I will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat tomorrow, he has </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">established for himself </span>a meal <span class="gemarra-regular">with them, </span>by stating his intention to eat the food as it is. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why </span>does the mishna mention <span class="gemarra-regular">particularly Shabbat? Even </span>if one said so <span class="gemarra-regular">on a weekday </span>the same should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>apply. Since he has set them aside for his meal, they are considered finished and are liable to tithes. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us </span>the following: One should not conclude <span class="gemarra-regular">that untithed produce </span>is inherently <span class="it-text">muktze</span> because one may not separate the tithes and eat it; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared with regard to Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one transgressed </span>the words of the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">and corrected it</span> by separating the tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">corrected</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 35a

The Gemara challenges: How can one say that the very decision to partake of the fruit establishes it as fixed with regard to tithes? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>true that even if one declared his intention to eat it the following day, it can nevertheless be assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">the remaining </span>fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">is restored </span>to the pile? <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we have heard </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Anywhere that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its leftovers are restored, it is not established </span>with regard to liability for tithes at all.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Ma’asrot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who removes olives from a vat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’atan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> where they are temporarily stored before being pressed <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dip </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">one by one in salt and eat </span>without tithing them first, since he is eating them one at a time. Although he is eating them with salt, it is not considered a fixed meal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he dipped </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and placed </span>several olives <span class="gemarra-regular">before him, </span>such as <span class="gemarra-regular">ten, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>in tithes. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>One who eats <span class="gemarra-regular">from a ritually pure vat is liable </span>to separate tithes; one who eats <span class="gemarra-regular">from a ritually impure vat is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exempt because he returns the surplus </span>to the vat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed it: What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause; </span>why is the issue of purity relevant to this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Abbahu </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: The first case </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a ritually pure vat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a ritually impure person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who transfers his impurity to the olives he touches. <span class="gemarra-regular">He may not return </span>the olives to the vat because he would thereby render all the remaining olives ritually impure. Therefore, from the outset he takes only the amount he wishes to eat. This is enough to consider it a fixed meal, and he must tithe them.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a ritually </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impure vat and a person </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may return </span>the olives to the vat, as the olives it contains are already ritually impure. He is not particular to take the exact amount he wants to eat, since he knows he may return the remaining olives, and they are therefore not considered fixed for tithes. For the purposes of this discussion, it can be seen from here that Rabbi Eliezer maintains that whenever one may restore the food, it is not considered fixed until its work is complete. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna also </span>deals <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> food that is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a ritually impure person, who may not return them </span>to the vat. The Gemara challenges this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But aren’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t they already returned? </span>This is not a case where a person takes all the fruit and replaces what remains after his meal; rather, he takes the amount he explicitly designated the day before, while the rest remains in place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: </span>The previous explanation is to be rejected, and it should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, you said? </span>There is no difficulty according to his approach. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he said </span>that the separation of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> itself <span class="gemarra-regular">establishe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the work of fruit as completed, so that one may not eat it even in a casual manner without first separating the other tithes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, all the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">more so, Shabbat </span>itself establishes food as fixed with regard to tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fruits from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has been separated before their work was completed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer prohibits eating from them </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a casual </span>manner without separating the rest of the tithes, as the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> establishes the food as fixed; <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Rabbis permit </span>it.
The Gemara suggests a different answer to Rava’s question as to whether Shabbat establishes an obligation to tithe food whose labor is incomplete: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution <span class="gemarra-regular">from the latter clause </span>of the mishna, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>Even in the Sabbatical Year, when <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes are not separated from fruit, a declaration from the day before is not enough to render the food prepared for Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless one marks </span>the fruit he is preparing <span class="gemarra-regular">and says </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">From here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to there. </span>The Gemara infers from this: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is that the eve of Shabbat </span>during <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sabbatical Year </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not fit for tithes; but during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other years </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Sabbatical </span>cycle, which <span class="gemarra-regular">are fit for </span>and obligated in <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes, </span>the fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited. What is the reason? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not because Shabbat </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes </span>them as fixed? If this is the view of the Rabbis, one may not reject it in favor of a minority opinion such as Rabbi Eliezer’s. 
The Gemara refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is no proof; <span class="gemarra-regular">there it is different. Since he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: From here to there I will eat tomorrow, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>his meal, and the reason is not due to Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why discuss </span>particularly <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat; even on a weekday as well </span>the same law applies? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us, </span>as stated above, <span class="gemarra-regular">that untithed produce </span>is not fundamentally <span class="it-text">muktze</span> because it is prohibited to remove the dues and tithes on Shabbat; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that if one transgressed </span>the words of the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">and tithed it, it is tithed.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we raise a contradiction </span>from a different source, in which it is taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one was eating from a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cluste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of grapes, whose work is not completed, as grapes are designated for juice extraction, <span class="gemarra-regular">and came in from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a garden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where one may eat fruit in a casual manner without separating tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">to a courtyard, Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: He may finish </span>eating the cluster, as the courtyard itself does not establish the fruit with regard to tithes, if their work was not completed beforehand. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He may not finish. </span>He maintains that a courtyard does establish the fruit as fixed for tithes, even if their work has not been completed. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it grew dark on </span>Friday evening, <span class="gemarra-regular">the night of Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>while one was eating the cluster, and eating on Shabbat is considered a fixed meal, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may finish, </span>as not even Shabbat establishes fruit as fixed if its work was not completed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He may not finish. </span>He holds that Shabbat does indeed establish fruit as fixed for tithes even if its work has not been completed. This indicates that Rabbi Eliezer maintains that Shabbat does not establish food with regard to tithes, whereas the mishna here indicates that he agrees that the beginning of Shabbat does establish them as fixed. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, the reason is as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he taught </span>explicitly that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that when Rabbi Eliezer said: He may finish, </span>he meant that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may finish in the courtyard </span>itself; <span class="gemarra-regular">but rather</span> he meant: <span class="gemarra-regular">He may exit the courtyard and finish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>similarly, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not that when Rabbi Eliezer said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He may finish, </span>he meant that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may finish on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat </span>itself; <span class="gemarra-regular">but rather, </span>he meant  that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may wait until the conclusion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Shabbat and finish. </span>If so, this source does not contradict the mishna here. 
With regard to the halakhic ruling in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">when Ravin came</span> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: Whether </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat; or </span>with regard to the separation of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> from fruit; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>into which the fruit is brought; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a transaction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>cases, if one sold the fruits, <span class="gemarra-regular">they establish </span>a requirement for tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">items whose labor is completed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara notes that each of these details teaches a novel <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who gathers fruits from one place to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to rea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the day </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified upon them, </span>i.e., Shabbat commenced, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel prohibits </span>the food from the gatherer <span class="gemarra-regular">himself. </span>In other words, Hillel alone prohibits eating the fruit in that case until its tithes have been separated, for he believes that the beginning of Shabbat itself causes the fruit to be considered completed. Rabbi Yoḥanan teaches that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case is not in accordance with the opinion of Hillel. 

Daf 35b

In addition, it was necessary for Rabbi Yoḥanan to teach the law that <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>does not establish fruit for tithes unless its work is completed, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ya’akov. As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who was transporting figs in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard to make them into dried figs, his children and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the members of his household may eat from them </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a casual </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are exempt from tithes. And </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught in that regard: Rabbi Ya’akov</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obligates </span>him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exempts </span>him.
With regard to the law that the separation of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> does not establish fruit as fixed for tithes, this comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer. As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fruits from which </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had been separated before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their work was completed, Rabbi Eliezer prohibits eating from them </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a casual </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis permit </span>it.
With regard to the statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">a transaction </span>does not fix fruit for tithes, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who acquires fig</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a place where most people</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> press </span>and dry their figs in order to make them into cakes, the work of the figs is not completed before this stage, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">partake of them</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">a casual </span>manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>when their work is completed, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>need only <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe them as doubtfully tithed produce, </span>in accordance with the law with regard to all produce bought from an uneducated person.
The Gemara comments: One can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a transaction establishes </span>produce as fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an item whose work is completed, </span>but if its work has not been completed, even selling it does not obligate it in tithes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And learn from here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">most </span>people who are in the category of <span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> separate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tithes, </span>and therefore one need only separate tithes as doubtfully tithed produce, rather than definitively untithed produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>another law: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may tithe doubtfully tithed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> purchased <span class="gemarra-regular">from an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to something whose work is not completed. </span>
Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in accordance with this opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclude that which we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exchanges fruit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his friend, </span>which is considered a commercial transaction, if their intention was for <span class="gemarra-regular">this one to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat and that one to eat, </span>or for <span class="gemarra-regular">this one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to make them into dried fruit and for that one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to make them into dried fruit, </span>they are both <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>in tithes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The one who took the fruits in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat is obligated, </span>as for him their labor is completed, but the one who intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to make them into dried fruit is exempt </span>and may partake of the fruit in a casual manner, as for him their work has not yet been completed. Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in opposition to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>. He maintains that the transaction itself does not make the fruit liable to tithes unless its work has been completed. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may lower produce, </span>which had been laid out on a roof to dry, into the house <span class="gemarra-regular">through a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">skyligh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, </span>in order to prevent it from becoming ruined in the rain. Although it is a strenuous activity, it is permitted do to so on a Festival in order to prevent a financial loss; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>do so <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. And one may cover </span><span class="gemarra-regular">produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> inside a building <span class="gemarra-regular">with cloths </span>to prevent damage <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a leak </span>in the ceiling over it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and similarly </span>one may cover <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of wine and jugs of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> for the same reason. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may place a vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beneath a leak </span>in order to catch the water <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat, </span>to prevent it from dirtying the house.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses the first word of the mishna from a linguistic standpoint. <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was said: Rav Yehuda and Rav Natan </span>recited differing versions of the mishna’s opening word, which is in all versions a verb meaning to lower. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mashilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as in the text of this mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one taught </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashḥilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The one who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not mistaken, and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashḥilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not mistaken, </span>as support can be found for both versions. He elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not mistaken, as it is written: “For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your olives will fall [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yishal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Deuteronomy 28:40). <span class="it-text">Mashilin</span> would therefore mean: To cause to fall. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashḥilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not mistaken, as we learned </span>the following cases in a mishna that lists blemishes that invalidate an animal for sacrifice: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shaḥul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kasul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The mishna explains these terms: <span class="gemarra-italic">Shaḥul</span> is referring to an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thigh is dislocated, </span>i.e., it has slipped out of place; <span class="gemarra-italic">kasul</span> is referring to an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">one of whose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thighs is higher than the other. </span>This shows that the root <span class="it-text">sh-ḥ-l-</span> is referring to something that has slipped down from its place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that there are other possible variations of this word as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">One who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashirin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not mistaken, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and one who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashḥirin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not mistaken, and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">manshirin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not mistaken.</span>
He elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashirin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not mistaken, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nazirite may not wash </span>the hair of <span class="gemarra-regular">his head with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clay </span>as a kind of shampoo, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it causes hair</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to fall off [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and a nazirite is prohibited to remove the hairs of his head. This shows that <span class="it-text">mashir</span> indicates causing something to fall. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashḥirin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">not mistaken, as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheḥor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a type of razor, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barber’s scissors, even if </span>their blades <span class="gemarra-regular">are detached, are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">subject to ritual impurity. </span>The fact that a razor is called <span class="it-text">sheḥor</span> implies that the root <span class="it-text">sh-ḥ-r</span> indicates causing to fall down.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one who teaches </span><span class="gemarra-italic">manshirin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not mistaken </span>either, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose clothes fell down [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nashru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] into water </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span> continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">walk in them </span>while they dry of their own accord, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he need not be concerned </span>that people might suspect him of having washed them on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>another support can be found <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which we learne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the following mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is gleaning [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leket</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>which must be left for the poor as commanded in Leviticus 19:9? <span class="gemarra-regular">That which falls [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nosher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] during reaping. </span>These sources show that the root <span class="it-text">n-sh-r</span> means: To fall down, and <span class="it-text">manshirin</span> would consequently mean: To cause to fall down.
§ The Gemara discusses the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may lower produce through </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a skylight on a Festival. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Up to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">how much </span>produce may be lowered in this manner? At what point is it considered to be too strenuous an activity to be performed on the Festival? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said, and some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna with regard to a different case: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may clear out four or five sack</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hay or grain </span>from a room on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> visitors, </span>to clear a place for them to sit, <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to suspension of </span>study in <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall, </span>i.e., to make room there for more people, who would not be able to study Torah otherwise. Here too, only four or five sacks’ worth of produce may be lowered from the roof. 
The Gemara raises an objection to the comparison of the two cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps there it is different, since there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the matter of preventing <span class="gemarra-regular">suspension of </span>study in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">study hall </span>or of providing hospitality to guests, i.e., moving those items is permitted in order to facilitate a mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, where there is no suspension of </span>study in <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall, </span>i.e., no facilitation of any mitzva, they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit one to move such a large amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively: There, this is the reasoning that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four or five sacks are permitted: Because Shabbat is severe </span>in people’s eyes <span class="gemarra-regular">and they will not come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">belittle it; but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, which is </span>regarded more <span class="gemarra-regular">lightly and which </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">might come to belittle, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>move the items <span class="gemarra-regular">at all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>a claim can be made <span class="gemarra-regular">from the other perspective: There, this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reasoning </span>that it is permitted to carry only four or five sacks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because there is no monetary loss </span>involved. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, where there is monetary loss </span>if the produce is not moved, one may carry <span class="gemarra-regular">even a larger amoun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> than four or five sacks. 

Daf 36a

The Gemara poses another question with regard to the same issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned elsewhere, </span>at the end of the mishna cited above concerning clearing out sacks for guests and study: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>clear out <span class="gemarra-regular">a storeroom. And Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not a storeroom? </span>It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">But one may not finish </span>clearing out <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> storeroom </span>while clearing out the sacks, exposing the floor of the storeroom. The reason this is prohibited is <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he come to level out depression</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in the dirt floor of the storeroom, which would constitute a biblically prohibited labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">What would be </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to lowering the produce from the roof on a Festival to prevent its ruin in the rain? Is it prohibited also in this case to remove all of it and thereby expose the floor of the roof? 
The Gemara specifies the possible arguments: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">it is there, on Shabbat, that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited, because </span>punishment for Shabbat desecration is <span class="gemarra-regular">severe, but</span> on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival, which </span>has a <span class="gemarra-regular">lighter </span>punishment for desecration, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is acceptable. Or perhaps </span>it can be argued to the contrary: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the sacks on Shabbat, even though <span class="gemarra-regular">there is suspension of </span>study in <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall, </span>i.e., the clearing out facilitates a mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit exposing the floor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of lowering produce on a Festival to prevent its ruin, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no suspension </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>study in <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall, </span>i.e., clearing out the produce does not facilitate any mitzva, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>prohibited?
The Gemara poses a further question. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lower produce through a skylight on a Festival, and Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman said: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the same roof, </span>i.e., only if the skylight is in the same roof where the produce is located, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>to carry the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">roof to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">roof </span>in order to lower it through a skylight in the second roof is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. This would involve too much exertion to be permitted on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">roof to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">roof, even when </span>the two <span class="gemarra-regular">roofs are on the same leve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> and there is no extra effort of lifting or lowering the produce while transporting it between the roofs. 
The question arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of moving sacks on Shabbat for guests or for study, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? May the sacks be moved from one roof or house to another for this purpose? Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the more so </span>they may not be moved on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>because Shabbat is more <span class="gemarra-regular">severe </span>than a Festival? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it can be argued to the contrary: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to transfer from one roof to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">because a Festival </span>is regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">lightly </span>by people <span class="gemarra-regular">and they might </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">come to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belittle it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, which is severe </span>in people’s eyes <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">they will not come to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belittle it, it is acceptable </span>to transfer even from one house to another. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>it may be argued: <span class="gemarra-regular">If here, </span>in the case of clearing produce from the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">when there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the issue of the <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce, you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>transfer from one roof to another, then <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of moving sacks on Shabbat for guests or study, <span class="gemarra-regular">when there is no </span>issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of produce, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>prohibited?
The Gemara presents yet another dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>with regard to bringing produce into one’s house from the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If there is no skylight from the roof to the house, necessitating another method of moving the produce out of the rain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lower them by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rope through the windows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor may he take them down by way of ladders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. There, </span>with regard to moving sacks on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? May they be moved by ropes or using a ladder? Perhaps it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of moving produce out of the rain <span class="gemarra-regular">on a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival, that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>because produce left on a roof <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>entail <span class="gemarra-regular">suspension of </span>a mitzva such as study in <span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall; but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, when there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the possibility that leaving the sacks in their current location will lead to <span class="gemarra-regular">suspension of </span>study in <span class="gemarra-regular">the study </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hall, it is acceptable </span>to remove them even via windows and ladders. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>it can be argued to the contrary: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the case of the produce on the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is </span>the issue of the <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, you say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of clearing out sacks on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>issue of the <span class="gemarra-regular">loss of produce, </span>should it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>be prohibited to lower them via windows and ladders? No resolution was found, so the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may cover produce </span>with cloths to prevent damage due to a leak. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: And even a row </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of bricks </span>that might be ruined by the rain may be covered to prevent damage. Although the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna mentions produce, it is not limited to that case, but extends to any item liable to be spoiled. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: </span>It applies only to an item like <span class="gemarra-regular">produce, which is fit </span>for use on the Festival, but not to items such as bricks, which are designated for building and are not fit for use on the Festival. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yitzḥak follows </span>his line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>in this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A vessel,</span> even if it is of the type that may be handled on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">may be handled </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if it is going to be used <span class="gemarra-regular">for something that may</span> itself <span class="gemarra-regular">be handled on Shabbat, </span>but not for the sake of set-aside [<span class="it-text">muktze</span>] objects. Since the bricks are <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, one may not handle cloths to cover the bricks.
The Gemara attempts to find a proof for this view: <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may cover produce with cloths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which seems to imply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Produce, yes, </span>because it may be handled on the Festival, but <span class="it-text">muktze</span> items such as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> row of bricks, no. </span>The Gemara rejects this argument: This is no proof, as it is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is true even </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a row of bricks, </span>i.e., that they may be covered. But <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in the first clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lower produce, </span>and there it is referring specifically to produce, as bricks may not be handled at all and surely not lowered from the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">he taught also in the latter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause: One may cover produce. </span>The example of produce was chosen to parallel the first clause in the mishna, not in order to imply exclusion of bricks. 
The Gemara offers a different proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly </span>one may cover <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of wine and jugs of oil </span>due to a leak in the ceiling. This choice of examples seems to indicate that one may cover only things that are fit for use on the Festival, as opposed to objects such as bricks, which are <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? With </span>jugs that contain wine and oil <span class="gemarra-regular">that are untithed, </span>which are not fit for Festival use and are therefore <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. And the same would be true for bricks.
The Gemara goes further: <span class="gemarra-regular">So, too, it is </span>in fact more <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable </span>that this is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enters your mind </span>that the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wine and jugs of oil </span>containing <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>liquids, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> already <span class="gemarra-regular">teach in the first clause </span>of this part of the mishna that it is permitted to cover <span class="gemarra-regular">produce? </span>What new information would be added by specifying jugs as well? 
The Gemara rejects this assertion. It is possible that the mishna is referring specifically to jugs containing permitted liquids. Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary for </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> to add the example of <span class="gemarra-regular">jugs of wine and jugs of oil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">it could enter your mind to say </span>that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were concerned over a substantial loss, </span>such as of produce, which can be ruined by drops of rain that leak on it. But <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a minor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">loss, </span>such as drops of rain falling into a wine jug or an oil jug, <span class="gemarra-regular">they were not concerned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and they did not permit covering them. The mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that those may be covered as well.
The Gemara raises objections against Rabbi Yitzḥak’s view: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may place a vessel beneath a leak on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat. </span>It is permitted, then, to bring a bucket for the purpose of containing the water leaking into the house, although that water is ostensibly not fit for drinking and is therefore <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. The Gemara rejects this objection: The case in the mishna is of <span class="gemarra-regular">leakage </span>of water <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">fi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to be drunk, at least by animals, and is consequently fit for Festival use. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another objection from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may spread a mat over bricks on Shabbat </span>to protect against rain. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explicitly permits covering bricks, which Rabbi Yitzḥak prohibited. The Gemara rejects this argument: This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to bricks <span class="gemarra-regular">that were left over from building </span>and are no longer designated for use in building, and <span class="gemarra-regular">which are </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for </span>use on the Festival by <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting on </span>them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another objection. It was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may spread a mat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">over stone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat, </span>although stones are <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. The Gemara responds: That <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is speaking not of ordinary stones but <span class="gemarra-regular">of rounded </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">mekurzalot</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">stones, which </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for</span> use in personal hygiene <span class="gemarra-regular">in the lavatory </span>on Shabbat, and are therefore not <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an objection from a different source. <span class="gemarra-regular">One may spread a mat over a beehiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat </span>to protect it from the elements, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sun due to the sun, and in the rain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to the rain, provided he does not have the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intent to trap </span>the bees inside by covering the hive, as trapping is prohibited on Shabbat. A beehive and its bees are not fit for Shabbat use, yet it is permitted to handle a mat in order to cover the hive. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, too, </span>the reference is to an item that is fit for Shabbat use, as it is discussing a hive <span class="gemarra-regular">when there is honey </span>in it, which can be eaten on Shabbat. It is therefore permitted to handle the mat for the sake of the honey.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ukva from Meishan said to Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ashi: </span>This explanation works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">summer, when there is honey, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">in the rainy season, </span>when there is no honey in beehives, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explicitly mentioned the two phrases in the sun and in the rain. The Gemara answers: This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only for those two honeycombs </span>left in the beehive in the winter to sustain the bees. The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are those two honeycombs </span>not <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as they have clearly been left for the sake of the bees, and not to be used by humans? The Gemara replies: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing here? </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the beekeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">had in mind </span>before the Festival that he was going to take them from the bees and eat <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>himself. 
The Gemara raises an objection to this interpretation. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he did not have in mind </span>to take <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>for himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Wouldn’t it be <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to spread a mat over the hive? If so, when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> goes on to specify that sometimes it is prohibited to cover the hive, <span class="gemarra-regular">rather than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaching: As long as he does not have the intent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to trap </span>the bees, introducing a totally new factor into the discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it make a distinction within the case</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself </span>by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said, </span>that the beehive may be covered? <span class="gemarra-regular">When he had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in mind </span>beforehand to take the honeycombs; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not have in mind </span>to take <span class="gemarra-regular">them, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited. </span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he had in mind </span>to take the honeycombs, so that there is no problem of the hive’s being <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, it is still permitted to cover it <span class="gemarra-regular">provided he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not have intent to trap </span>the bees. 
The Gemara raises a further objection against this interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you establish </span>and explain this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who, </span>in disagreement with Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> apply. But now <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have the intent to trap. </span>This indicates that even though the bees may be trapped in the process of covering, it is permitted if this was not his intention. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have come to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who, in disagreement with Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">An unintentional act is permitted </span>even though it leads inadvertently to a prohibited result. This interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is internally conflicted, half in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda and half in accordance with Rabbi Shimon. 
The Gemara rejects this argument. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> follows the view <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>at all? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Abaye and Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> both say: Rabbi Shimon concedes </span>that even an unintentional act is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Cut off its head</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and will it not die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In this case the person covering the hive with a mat inevitably traps the bees, even if he does not have intent to do so, and this act should be prohibited even by Rabbi Shimon. 
Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and with what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing here? </span>With a beehive <span class="gemarra-regular">that has windows, </span>i.e., small openings, besides the main opening on top, so that some of the windows remain uncovered and covering the hive does not inevitably trap the bees. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not say, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda: Provided he does not have intent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to trap </span>the bees, which would imply that the deciding factor is the intention of the one who covers them, 

Daf 36b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but rather </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided he does not make it a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trap </span>as he covers it, i.e., as long as he takes care not to cover all the openings. The Gemara questions this: But it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that it is prohibited to directly trap bees on Shabbat; why would the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mention it? The Gemara responds: It does inform us of something that is not obvious: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: </span>An animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose type is </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">trapped </span>and hunted by people for some purpose is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to be trapped on Shabbat, whereas an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose type is not </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">trapped, </span>such as a bee, is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to be trapped even <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, as this is not considered to be the normal manner of hunting. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that one may not in fact trap bees.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>a different elucidation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> summer, and: In the rainy season? </span>No, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: In the sun due to the sun and in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the rain due to the rain. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> speaks not of the summer and the rainy season, but <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>spring <span class="gemarra-regular">days of Nisan and the </span>autumn <span class="gemarra-regular">days of Tishrei, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when there is </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">sun and there is </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">rain,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">honey </span>in the hive. It is possible, then, that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> permits covering the hive during these seasons because of the honey that is in it, as initially proposed.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may place a vessel beneath a leak</span> in order to catch the water <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the vessel became full </span>with the leaking water, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may pour out </span>its contents, place the vessel back under the leak, <span class="gemarra-regular">and repeat </span>the entire process if necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he need <span class="gemarra-regular">not refrain </span>from doing so.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s millhous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> once <span class="gemarra-regular">developed a leak </span>on Shabbat. Abaye was concerned about the potential damage to the millstones, which were made partly of clay and which would become ruined from the leaking water, and he did not have enough buckets to catch all the water without emptying and refilling them. But the water was unfit for drinking and was therefore <span class="it-text">muktze</span> and could not be removed. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">came before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> to ask him how to proceed. Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">bring your bed into </span>the millhouse, <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the dirty water <span class="gemarra-regular">will be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a container</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of excrement, </span>which, despite being <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, may be removed from one’s presence due to its repulsive nature, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>the water. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye sat </span>and examined the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">and posed a difficulty: And may one initiate </span>a situation of <span class="gemarra-regular">a container of excrement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., may one intentionally place any repulsive matter into a situation which will bother him and will then have to be removed, <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? In the meantime, </span>as he was deliberating the issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye’s millhouse collapsed. He said: I had</span> this <span class="gemarra-regular">coming to me for having gone against the words</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of my master</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabba, by not following his ruling unquestioningly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a container of excremen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a container of urine, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to remove them </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garbage heap. And when he returns </span>the container to the house <span class="gemarra-regular">he must place water in it </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">return it, </span>for it is prohibited to carry these containers alone, as their foul odor makes them <span class="it-text">muktze</span> due to their repulsive nature. 
Some Sages at first <span class="gemarra-regular">understood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the wording of Shmuel’s statement that with regard to removing <span class="gemarra-regular">a container of excrement on account of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vessel, </span>i.e., along with its vessel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>this is permitted; but to remove the excrement <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>without a vessel containing it: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is prohibited. The Gemara counters this conclusion with the following story: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear that a certain </span>dead <span class="gemarra-regular">mouse was discovered in Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ashi’s storeroom </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">spices </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">isparmekei</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Take hold of it by its tail </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and remove it. </span>This shows that repulsive matter may be removed even directly.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Any act for which one is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable due to a rabbinic decree </span>made to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of <span class="gemarra-regular">rest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; </span>or if it is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">optional</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it involves an aspect of a mitzva but is not a complete mitzva; or if it is notable <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is </span>a full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva, </span>if it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, one is liable for it on a Festival</span> as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And these are </span>the acts prohibited by the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may not climb a tree </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor ride on an animal, nor swim in the water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor clap </span>his hands together, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor clap </span>his hand on the <span class="gemarra-regular">thigh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor dance. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">following </span>are acts that are prohibited on Shabbat and are notable <span class="gemarra-regular">because they are optional, </span>i.e., which involve an aspect of a mitzva but are not complete mitzvot: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not judge, nor betroth </span>a woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perform </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is done in lieu of levirate marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor perform levirate marriage. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the following </span>are prohibited on Shabbat despite the fact that they are notable <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the </span>full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> involved in them: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not consecrate, nor take a valuation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vow </span>(see Leviticus 27), <span class="gemarra-regular">nor consecrate </span>objects for use by the priests or the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from produce.
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>acts being prohibited even <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a Festival; all the more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>are they prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>The general principle is: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between a Festival and Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>work involving preparation of <span class="gemarra-regular">food alone, </span>which is permitted on a Festival but prohibited on Shabbat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the reasons for each of these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not climb a tree. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>that was made <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one detach </span>branches or leaves as he climbs, thereby transgressing the prohibited labor of reaping. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Nor ride </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on an animal: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>that was made <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one go beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on the animal. The Gemara asks: Can one then <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that the prohibition against venturing beyond <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits, </span>which applies also to Festivals, <span class="gemarra-regular">is by Torah law? </span>If the prohibition with regard to the Shabbat limit were rabbinic, the Sages would not have reinforced it with the additional decree against riding an animal. It is known that this is a matter of dispute; in light of this explanation of the mishna it would be a proof that Shabbat boundaries are of Torah origin. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>give a different reason for the prohibition: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>that was made <span class="gemarra-regular">lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one cut off a branch </span>to use as a riding switch, and thereby perform the labor of reaping, which is prohibited by Torah law.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Nor swim in the water: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>that was made <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one make a swimmer’s barrel, </span>i.e., an improvised flotation device used to teach beginners how to swim. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Nor clap </span>one’s hands together, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clap his hand on the thigh, nor dance: </span>All of these are prohibited due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>that was made <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one assemble put together a musical instrument </span>to accompany his clapping or dancing.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> following </span>are acts that are prohibited on Shabbat and are notable <span class="gemarra-regular">because they are optional, </span>i.e., which involve an aspect of a mitzva but are not complete mitzvot: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not judge. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one perform</span> a full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>by acting as a judge in a court? Why is it categorized as optional rather than as a full-fledged mitzva? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to categorize it as optional, as it is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>another person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is more </span>qualified <span class="gemarra-regular">than he. </span>Since the other person can judge even better, it is not considered an absolute mitzva for the first one to judge. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor betroth </span>a woman: The Gemara asks: Why is this categorized as optional, indicating that it is not a full-fledged mitzva? <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doesn’t one perform a </span>full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>when he marries, as this enables him to fulfill the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to categorize it as optional, 

Daf 37a

<span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is dealing with a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">has a wife and children, </span>so that he has already fulfilled the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply, and his betrothal of another woman is only an optional act. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor perform </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor perform levirate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">marriage: </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t one perform a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mitzva </span>through these acts? Why are they categorized as optional? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to categorize them as optional, as it is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when there is an older </span>brother. Since the general principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>preferable way to carry out the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva is for the oldest </span>brother <span class="gemarra-regular">to perform </span><span class="gemarra-regular">levirate marriage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the performance of levirate marriage by a younger brother is classified as optional. 
The Gemara clarifies the reason for the prohibition against judging, betrothing, etc., on Shabbat and Festivals: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>they may not be performed? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest one write </span>down the proceedings of these acts in a document, such as the verdict of a judgment, the document of betrothal, a document testifying to the <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>, or a marriage contract in the case of levirate marriage.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the following </span>are notable <span class="gemarra-regular">because of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>involved in them, yet are prohibited on Shabbat: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not consecrate, nor take a valuation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vow, nor consecrate </span>objects for use by the priests or the Temple. The Gemara explains: All these cases are prohibited because of <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree due to </span>their similarity to <span class="gemarra-regular">commerce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> These acts, which all involve the transfer of ownership to the Temple treasury, resemble commerce, which is prohibited on a Festival.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terumot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tithes. </span>The Gemara asks: Is it not <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is so? In doing so one makes forbidden food usable, a form of repairing, which is a prohibited labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef taught: It is necessary </span>for the mishna to teach this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to state that it is prohibited even to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to give it to a priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the same day. </span>One could have thought that since he is separating the produce in order to give it to a priest it should be permitted like any other preparation of food; the mishna therefore states explicitly that it is prohibited.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this applies only to produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>had the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce, </span>and therefore was required to be tithed, <span class="gemarra-regular">the day before </span>the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, produce that became untithed now </span>on the Festival itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as dough </span>prepared on the Festival, which becomes untithed and requires <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> to be taken from it only after the dough is made: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">separating </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from it, one may separate </span>the <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to a priest </span>even on a Festival.
The Gemara asks a question. When the mishna describes <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>cases as notable <span class="gemarra-regular">because they are optional, </span>is this to say that to say that their prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">not because </span>of a <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic decree </span>to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of <span class="gemarra-regular">rest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? </span>Likewise, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>cases described as notable <span class="gemarra-regular">because they are mitzvot, </span>is this to say that their prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">not because of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The mishna, by referring only to the first of its three categories as <span class="it-text">shevut</span>, implies that the acts listed in the following categories do not involve <span class="it-text">shevut</span>. But this is not so; as the Gemara stated above, all these acts are prohibited by rabbinic decree to enhance the character of Shabbat and the Festival as days of rest. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: </span>They are indeed all prohibited as <span class="it-text">shevut</span>. The mishna lists three types of <span class="it-text">shevut</span>: Those that involve no mitzva whatsoever, those that have a mitzva aspect to them, and those that constitute a full-fledged mitzva. And the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking </span>and arranges his list employing the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no need, </span>i.e., he arranges the cases in order of increasing notability. First, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no need </span>to state, i.e., it is most obvious, that <span class="gemarra-regular">plain </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which involves no mitzva at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, but even </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an optional act, </span>i.e., an act that is a minor mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also prohibited. And there is no need </span>to state, i.e., it is obvious, that <span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an optional act</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited, but even </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span> a full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is also prohibited. </span>
§ It was taught in the mishna: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>acts being prohibited even <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a Festival; </span>all the more so are they prohibited on Shabbat. There is no difference between a Festival and Shabbat except for work involving food. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>against this from an earlier mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may lower </span>produce from the roof into the house <span class="gemarra-regular">through a skylight </span>to prevent it from being spoiled by the rain <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, but not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat. </span>This shows that there is another difference between a Festival and Shabbat besides food preparation: Doing a strenuous activity to prevent a loss is permitted on a Festival but prohibited on Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mishna here, which does not include the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of lowering produce as an example of a difference between Shabbat and a Festival, is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>previous mishna that does cite it as a difference is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehoshua. </span>
Rav Yosef elaborates on his statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a cow and her calf, which may not be slaughtered on the same day because of the biblical prohibition: “You shall not kill <span class="gemarra-regular">it and its offspring </span>both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into a pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on a Festival, and their owner wishes to take them out, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter it, and </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the second</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he provides it sustenance in its place so that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not die </span>in the pit. It is prohibited to undertake the strenuous task of raising an animal out of a pit except for the purpose of eating it on the Festival. Therefore, since one cannot slaughter both animals on the Festival, only one can be raised, while the other should be sustained in its place until after the Festival.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may raise the first with the intent of slaughtering it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then change his mind and <span class="gemarra-regular">not slaughter it. Then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may go back and employ artifice </span>by deciding that he prefers to slaughter the second one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he raises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the second. </span>Having raised both animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may slaughter this </span>one; <span class="gemarra-regular">if he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">desires he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may slaughter that </span>one. Rav Yosef understands the argument between the two Sages as follows: Rabbi Yehoshua maintains that it is permitted to perform a strenuous activity on a Festival in order to prevent a loss, and therefore he may raise both animals, lest the one left behind die in the pit. Rabbi Eliezer, on the other hand, holds that one may not perform a strenuous activity to prevent a loss, so the second animal must be left in the pit even though it may die there. It may therefore be posited that the mishna that permits lowering produce on a Festival to prevent loss is in accordance with Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion. Rabbi Eliezer would disagree with this leniency, and the principle that there is no difference between Shabbat and a Festival other than food preparation would remain intact. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you know that this analysis of these Sages’ opinions is correct? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer stated </span>his opinion that a strenuous activity to prevent monetary loss is prohibited on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">only thus far, there </span>in the case of the animals in the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is possible to sustain </span>the second animal in the pit and keep it from dying. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of the produce on the roof, where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no possibility </span>of preventing the loss <span class="gemarra-regular">through providing sustenance, </span>he would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>prohibit lowering the produce to save it from loss. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>one can propose an opposite argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua stated </span>his opinion that a strenuous activity to prevent loss is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">only thus far</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, there </span>in the case of the two animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is possible to employ artifice </span>to raise the second animal, so that an observer might assume that that he was not acting to preserve his property, but wished to eat the first animal and subsequently changed his mind. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the produce on the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is not possible to employ artifice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is clear that he is acting to salvage his produce, Rabbi Yehoshua would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be lenient. Therefore, Rav Yosef’s approach to resolving the contradiction has no support from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Pappa said: </span>This resolution of the contradiction is to be rejected in favor of the following: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case follows the approach of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>On a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not take out a child </span>who cannot walk, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lulav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor a Torah scroll</span> into the public domain, as none of these are required for the preparation of food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel permit </span>it. It is certainly prohibited to carry out any item into the public domain on Shabbat, yet Beit Hillel permit it on a Festival. Therefore, it may be posited that just as Beit Hillel allow carrying out items on a Festival but not on Shabbat, so would they permit moving the produce off the roof on a Festival but not on Shabbat. According to Beit Shammai, who forbid carrying items out on a Festival and on Shabbat equally, moving the produce from the roof would also be equally prohibited, and the principle that there is no difference between Shabbat and a Festival other than food preparation would remain intact. 
The Gemara at first refutes this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps that is not so, </span>as it is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai stated </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only thus far, there </span>with regard to the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">transferring </span>objects from one domain to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">moving </span>objects, such as produce, from place to place in the house. The Gemara rejects this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">moving is not </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of taking out </span>to the public domain? The decree against moving items unnecessarily, i.e., not for use on Shabbat or a Festival, was enacted due to a concern that one might take objects into the public domain. Rav Pappa’s explanation that it is only Beit Shammai who would prohibit lowering the produce from the roof therefore stands.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The status of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals and vessels </span>on Festivals <span class="gemarra-regular">is as the feet of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that one’s animals and vessels are governed by his own travel limitations on Shabbat and Festivals. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who delivers his animal to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a shepherd </span>before the Festival to care for it, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are as the feet of the owner, </span>rather than those of the son or the shepherd.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Vessels that </span>have been inherited by several brothers and have not been divided among them but are still owned jointly, if they <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designated for </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the house </span>and the other brothers have no part in them, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are as his feet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and they are subject to his travel limitations. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for those <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not designated </span>for any particular brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a place where </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">go. </span>They are limited by the travel limitations of every one of the brothers, as when one brother made a joining of Shabbat boundaries [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>] and the others did not.
<span class="gemarra-regular">One who borrows a vessel from another on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve of a Festival, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the borrower </span>rather than the owner, as when the Festival began the vessel established its place of rest in possession of the borrower. However, if he borrowed it <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>itself, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of the lender, </span>since at the start of the Festival its place of rest was established in the possession of its owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> similarly, a woman who borrowed spices from another </span>to put in a dish, <span class="gemarra-regular">or water and sal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to put in <span class="gemarra-regular">her dough, these </span>foods, i.e., the dish and the dough, which contain ingredients belonging to both parties, <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the feet of both of them; </span>they are limited by the travel limitations of both parties. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda exempts </span>one from travel limitations <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water, because it </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">no substance </span>in the mixture and therefore is not considered connected to the original owner.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asserts: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mishna</span>

Daf 37b

is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa says, and some say Abba Shaul </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: One who purchases an animal from another on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve of a Festival, even if he did not deliver </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it to him until the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the feet of the purchaser. And one who delivers his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal to a shepherd, even if he did not deliver </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it to him until the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the feet of the shepherd. </span>The mishna, on the other hand, teaches that an animal delivered to a shepherd remains as the feet of the owner, therefore apparently contradicting Rabbi Dosa.
The Gemara rejects the assertion that this is a contradiction. <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say</span> that the mishna is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa, and</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a town that has only <span class="gemarra-regular">one shepherd. </span>In that case the owner knows with certainty beforehand that he will be delivering his animal to this shepherd over the course of the Festival, and therefore the animal’s place of rest is established as being identical to that of the shepherd. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>however, the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a town where there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two shepherds. </span>Since the issue of which of them will receive this animal is undetermined when the Festival begins, the animal remains as the feet of its owner.The Gemara strengthens this assertion that the mishna is dealing with a case where there are two shepherds: The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>in accordance with this interpretation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches: To his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son or to a shepherd</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> suggesting that initially he did know to whom he would give the animal. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that this is so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that animals given to a shepherd are as the feet of the shepherd. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</span> actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>a general principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> always <span class="gemarra-regular">follows an unattributed </span>statement in <span class="gemarra-regular">a mishna? And we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Animals</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and vessels are as the feet of the owner. </span>One who delivers his animal to his son or to a shepherd, it is as the feet of the owner. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did we not establish </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of Rabbi Dosa is dealing with a different case than the mishna, that <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> it is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a town with <span class="gemarra-regular">one shepherd, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>in the mishna it is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a town with <span class="gemarra-regular">two shepherds? </span>There is consequently no contradiction between establishing the halakha both in accordance with Rabbi Dosa and in accordance with the mishna.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who borrowed one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rob</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in partnership </span>from a third party, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to go to the study hall with it </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning and that </span>person in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to enter</span> a wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">feast with it </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">evening, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one made a joining </span>of Shabbat boundaries [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself to the north </span>in order to reach his destination, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">made an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for himself to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the south </span>in order to reach his destination, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who made an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for himself to the north may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walk </span>with the robe only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the north </span>as far <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is permitted for <span class="gemarra-regular">the feet of the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who made an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for himself to the south, </span>i.e., he may go north only as far as the other borrower may go.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who made </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for himself to the south may walk </span>with the robe <span class="gemarra-regular">to the south </span>only as far <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>is permitted for the <span class="gemarra-regular">feet of the one who made an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for himself to the north, </span>as the robe is as the feet of both borrowers and may go only as far as both of them may walk. If each of them placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> at a distance of one thousand cubits from their house, to the north and south respectively, they may each walk, without the robe, three thousand cubits from their regular dwelling-place, one partner toward the north and the other partner toward the south. The three thousand cubits are comprised of the thousand cubits from the house to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> plus another two thousand, the standard Shabbat limit, from the location of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The one whose <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is in the north may not wear the robe farther than one thousand cubits north of his house, as he would then be going beyond the farthest extent of the other’s Shabbat limit, and vice versa for the one whose <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is in the south. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> made </span>their respective <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>end <span class="gemarra-regular">in the center</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if one placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> two thousand cubits from the house to the south, so that the house is his farthest limit to the north, and the other placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> two thousand cubits to the north of the house, the house being his farthest limit to the south, <span class="gemarra-regular">then each </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">may not move </span>the robe <span class="gemarra-regular">from its place </span>at all.
The Gemara records a dispute between <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who purchased</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a barrel </span>of wine <span class="gemarra-regular">or an animal in partnershi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> before a Festival, in order to divide the contents of the barrel or the meat of the animal between them on the Festival itself, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if the two people have different Shabbat limits? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">barrel is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>to each of them, and each may take his portion on the Festival and transfer it within his respective Shabbat limit, which is also applicable to Festivals; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal is prohibited, </span>and each portion of it may be transferred only within the limits that are shared by both purchasers. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">barrel is also prohibited </span>to be transferred beyond the limits shared by both people.
The Gemara questions the opinion of Rav, who distinguished between the case of the barrel and that of the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">What does Rav hold? If he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is</span> retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>so that after the division of the barrel it becomes clarified retroactively which portion belonged to which partner, and the Festival place of rest for each portion is established at the start of the Festival in accordance with the person who will later become its owner, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal should be permitted. And if he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>so that at the start of the Festival both portions of the animal belong jointly to both of them and may therefore be transferred only within the limits shared by both people, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">barrel should be prohibited. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the explanation for Rav is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>and the reason Rav was stringent in the case of the animal is that <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different, as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">limits absorb from each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A live animal cannot be divided into two parts for ownership; each part of its body depends on and is nourished by the other. Consequently, even if the designation of the respective portions takes place retroactively, each portion continues to draw from the other part, so that at the time of division the two portions are once again mixed together. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: </span>If that is your rationale, this indicates that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concerned about the prohibition of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is not assumed that each of them removed the portion of his partner from his mind, thereby prohibiting it from his own use, and yet <span class="gemarra-regular">they were concerned about the prohibition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits. </span>Isn’t this illogical? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav was silent</span> and offered no response.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>this issue? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Hoshaya said: </span>In general, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>and they can therefore each transport their portions of both the barrel and the animal to their respective places. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, </span>and therefore they may not move their portions of either the barrel or the animal except within the limits shared by both of them. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Rabbi Hoshaya </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">hold there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse in a house that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has many entrances, all </span>the entrances <span class="gemarra-regular">are ritually impure, </span>i.e., everything situated in the space of the entrance becomes impure, even in the part that lies beyond a closed door, separating it from the corpse. Since any of the entrances might be used to remove the corpse, and none are designated for that purpose, all are rendered impure. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if one of them was </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">opened, </span>then the space of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>particular entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">is impure, while all the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> others are pure, </span>as it is assumed that that the corpse will be removed by way of the open door. Even if none of the entrances was actually open, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to remove </span>the corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>a particular <span class="gemarra-regular">one of </span>the entrances <span class="gemarra-regular">or through a window that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths in size, this intention of his <span class="gemarra-regular">saves all the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances </span>from impurity.
The details of this last <span class="it-text">halakha</span> are disputed by <span class="it-text">tanna</span><span class="it-text">’im</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: And this </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had this intention before the dead person died, </span>so that at the time of death it was known which entrance would be used. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>It applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> if he had this intention only <span class="gemarra-regular">after the dead person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> died. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to this </span>mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Hoshaya said: </span>When Beit Hillel said that the other entrances are pure even if one thought of removing the corpse via a particular entrance only after the person died, they meant only <span class="gemarra-regular">to purify</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the entrances from that point and onward; </span>from the moment of his intention there is no more impurity in the other entrances. From this the Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">From here and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> onward: Yes, </span>the other entrances are saved from impurity, but <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactively: No. </span>Whatever was in the doorways before this intent was formulated has already contracted ritual impurity and this cannot be reversed retroactively by one’s subsequent thoughts. This indicates that the principle of retroactive designation is not accepted by Rabbi Hoshaya.
The Gemara resolves this contradiction in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the presentation of their opinions given above, and say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Hoshaya said: There is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation, and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: There is </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation.</span>
The Gemara questions this resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>the principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation? But didn’t Rav Asi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: Brothers who divided </span>property received as an inheritance <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">purchasers </span>from each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as purchasers of land <span class="gemarra-regular">they must return </span>the portions <span class="gemarra-regular">to each other </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the Jubilee </span>year, at which point they may redistribute the property? This demonstrates that Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold that it is retroactively established that each brother’s portion was designated for him directly upon their father’s death, but rather it is considered that all the land was joint property until the brothers traded or bought their respective portions from each other. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you should say: When does Rabbi Yoḥanan not accept </span>the principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation? </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>regard to matters that are <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he does hold </span>of retroactive designation <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>regard to matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic law, </span>such as the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat limits; this would account for the discrepancy. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But does he accept </span>retroactive designation <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic law? Didn’t </span>the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Ayo teach </span>otherwise in regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of joining of Shabbat boundaries [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>]? As it was taught in a mishna: One who has heard that a rabbi will be coming to a place near his town to deliver a lesson on Shabbat, but is unsure where the lecture will take place, may place two <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> on Shabbat eve in two different directions, while stipulating that only the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on the side where the rabbi will teach will take effect. Furthermore, if he hears that two rabbis will be coming to two different locations, he may place two <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> and stipulate that he will decide on Shabbat which rabbi he prefers, and consequently which of the two <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> will take effect. 
Ayo taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>disagreed with this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: A person may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">make a stipulation with regard to two </span>contradictory <span class="gemarra-regular">things at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">once, </span>and therefore if two Sages will be arriving, his condition is of no effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is true that in the first case, where he knows that a rabbi is coming but does not know from which direction, he may place two <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> and stipulate that <span class="gemarra-regular">if the rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">comes from the east his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the east </span>will take effect, and if the rabbi comes <span class="gemarra-regular">from the west</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the west </span>will take effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in the second case, when two rabbis come to the two locations, one of them arriving <span class="gemarra-regular">here and </span>the other arriving <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>and one wants to place two <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> and decide on Shabbat which of the two lecture he will attend, this he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>do; that would require the identity of the functional <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to be determined retroactively, and one’s place of rest must be determined when Shabbat begins. 

Daf 38a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we discussed </span>the following difficulty <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>teaching of Ayo: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about the case where two rabbis are coming to the two locations, one <span class="gemarra-regular">here and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>and one places two <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, planning to decide on Shabbat which lecture he will attend? Why did Rabbi Yehuda state that this may not be done? It is because he held that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>But if so, in the first case <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>where only one rabbi comes, but the location of his lecture was not known before Shabbat, and one placed <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> in the <span class="gemarra-regular">east and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">west, </span>we should say that neither is effective because the rabbi’s location will not be known until Shabbat, and <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>in explanation: This first case is referring to a situation in which the <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbi had already </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> before the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was placed, but the one placing the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> does not know the rabbi’s location. Therefore, it had already been determined which of the two <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> would be effective, although it was not yet known to him when Shabbat began. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not accept </span>the principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation </span>even in matters of rabbinic law, as he states that if the rabbi were to arrive after the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was placed, it would not be effective retroactively.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects this approach and states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, do not reverse </span>the views of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Hoshaya; it is indeed Rabbi Hoshaya, also known as Rabbi Oshaya, who accepts retroactive designation, and Rabbi Yoḥanan who rejects it. As for Rabbi Oshaya’s statement with regard to the entrances to a house that contains a corpse, the following answer may be offered: <span class="gemarra-regular">And when does Rabbi Oshaya not hold </span>of the principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation? </span>With regard to matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah</span> law, such as the ritual impurity of the dead. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to </span>matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic </span>law, such as Shabbat limits and the placement of <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does accept</span> this principle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra taught in </span>a public <span class="gemarra-regular">lesson: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya </span>with regard to retroactive designation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: An ox of a fattener</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one whose occupation is to fatten oxen in order to sell them for their meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">is as the feet of all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people. </span>It is as the feet of the one who acquires the animal on the Festival, even if the buyer is from another city, as the fattener’s intention when the Festival begins is that the ox belong to whoever buys it. But <span class="gemarra-regular">an ox of a shepherd</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who raises oxen for himself but occasionally sells them to his neighbors or acquaintances, <span class="gemarra-regular">is as the feet of </span>the people of <span class="gemarra-regular">that city, </span>as his intention when the Festival begins is that he might sell the animal to someone in town, but not to someone from out of town.
§ The mishna states: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> borrows a vessel from another on the eve of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is as the feet of the borrower. The Gemara asks: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the case, as the place of rest of the vessel has already been established in the possession of the borrower. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one did not deliver </span>the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">to him until the Festival </span>itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: </span>Since the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish it in </span>the borrower’s <span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>before the Festival began, it should remain as the feet of the lender, the mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that it is not so, but it is as the feet of the borrower. 
The Gemara comments: Interpreted in this manner, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>a statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who borrows a vessel from another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the eve of a Festival, even if he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not give it to him until the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is as the feet of the borrower.</span>
§ It is taught in the mishna: If one borrowed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the feet of the lender. </span>The Gemara again wonders: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where this borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">is accustomed to borrowing </span>such items <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>this lender. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that since it is a regular occurrence for this loan to take place, the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it in his possession </span>ahead of time, and it should therefore be considered as though the object’s place of rest is established as the feet of the borrower, the mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that it is not so, as the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly says </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he will find</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> someone else </span>this time, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he will go and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">borrow from him. </span>Consequently, the lender does not transfer possession of the object to the borrower until the latter takes it, and it may be carried only where the lender may go.
§ It is taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, a woman who borrowed </span>spices <span class="gemarra-regular">from another </span>to put in a dish, or water and salt to put in her dough, these are as the feet of both of them. The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Abb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ascended </span>from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: May </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it be </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">will that I say a statement </span>of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that will be accepte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by my listeners in Eretz Yisrael, so that I will not be put to shame. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he ascended, </span>he found <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina bar Pappi, and Rabbi Zeira, and some say </span>he found <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu, Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, and Rabbi Yitzḥak </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nappaḥa, and </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">were sitting and saying </span>in a discussion of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is this the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to dough? <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">water and salt be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">nullifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the dough, </span>and the status of the dough should follow its flour rather than its minor ingredients, such as water and salt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said to them: </span>

Daf 38b

<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one’s single <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat became mingle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s wheat, </span>shall <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter eat </span>all eleven <span class="it-text">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rejoice? </span>One does not allow his property to become nullified into someone else’s property. The same applies to water and salt in dough. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">laughed at him. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">I take your cloak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from you that you are putting me to shame? <span class="gemarra-regular">They again</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laughed at him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya said: They did well to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laugh at him. </span>They were correct that the two cases are dissimilar, as they reasoned as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different</span> about a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat </span>belonging to one person that became mingled <span class="gemarra-regular">with barley </span>of another, that Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not say </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">to them </span>as an example? He specifically chose an example of wheat mingling with other wheat and not that case of barley <span class="gemarra-regular">because that is </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">type </span>mingled <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>something <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not its </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">type</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The principle is: <span class="gemarra-regular">A type </span>of food mixed <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span> a large amount of food <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>of its own <span class="gemarra-regular">type</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> becomes nullified, </span>and this principle applies even when the two foods belong to two different people. If so, the same may be said when <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat </span>of one individual is mixed <span class="gemarra-regular">with wheat </span>of another <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. Although, according to Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda, </span>an item mingled with another item of the same type <span class="gemarra-regular">is not nullified, according to the Rabbis </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is certainly nullified.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra said </span>to Rabbi Oshaya: <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses! </span>This is a term of reverence for the leader of the generation. Have you in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">spoken wel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> in defending those who scoffed at Rabbi Abba? <span class="gemarra-regular">But, did </span>those Sages who scoffed <span class="gemarra-regular">not hear </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Ḥiyya of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ketosfa’a in the name of Rav: One who removes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pebble</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from another’s </span>wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">granary is obligated </span>to reimburse him for the loss he has caused and <span class="gemarra-regular">pay </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him the value of wheat </span>according to the weight of those stones. The latter could have sold those pebbles along with his wheat, as there is always some refuse mixed in with the wheat that is weighed and sold along with it. Therefore, the removal of the pebbles has caused the owner of the granary a monetary loss. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>he must compensate him because <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has reduced his measur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of wheat. Despite the fact that the pebbles themselves are worthless, we do not say that the pebbles were nullified in the wheat and that consequently there is no loss involved in their removal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>in the case of one who borrows water and salt, which are not worthless, all the more so may we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">one has reduced his measure, </span>and he must compensate the lender; it cannot be said that they are nullified in the dough and that they are no longer taken into account regarding the Shabbat limit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>objected to the comparison to the case with the pebbles in the wheat, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Safra: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">the master not differentiate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between money that has claimants, </span>such as in the case of the pebbles removed from the granary in which the owner seeks compensation and therefore there is no nullification, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> money that does not have claimants, </span>as in the case of water and salt, where the owner lent them to the borrower and does not demand them back for now? In the latter case it is possible for these ingredients to be considered nullified. 
Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that one must distinguish between money that has claimants and money that does not, how would you account for <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>According to Rabbi Yehuda, who maintains that an item can be nullified only when mixed with an item of a different type but not of the same type, flesh of an unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can be nullified in </span>a larger quantity of meat of <span class="gemarra-regular">a slaughtered </span>animal. Although carcass meat generally imparts impurity, if someone touches the mixture of the two meats he does not become ritually impure, as the carcass meat is considered a different type from the slaughtered animal, and is therefore nullified. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>meat from <span class="gemarra-regular">a slaughtered </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot attain the status of carcass</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and it is therefore viewed as a different type. 
The Gemara continues to cite Rav Ḥisda’s statement: However, if meat of a slaughtered animal became mingled with a larger quantity of pieces of animal carcass, the meat of the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered</span> animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is not nullified by the carcass, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possible for a carcass to attain the status of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughtered </span>animal. This means that it can lose its ability to transmit ritual impurity, as if a carcass becomes spoiled to the extent that it is no longer edible, it loses its impure status. The fact that the carcass meat has the potential ability to attain the status of slaughtered meat renders the two meats as the same type, and according to Rabbi Yehuda the smaller amount of slaughtered meat would not be nullified in the larger amount of carcass meat. The entirety of the mixture would not be considered carcass meat, but would retain its status of intermingled carcass and slaughtered meat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>will you say <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">has owners </span>other than the owner of the slaughtered meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not nullified </span>in the slaughtered meat? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Yes, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is indeed so, but isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught: Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said: Ownerless objects acquire residence</span> for Shabbat in their location, and anyone who finds them on Shabbat may move them two thousand cubits in all directions but not beyond that, as <span class="gemarra-regular">although they have no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> owner, it is as though they have an owner? </span>This shows that even property that has no claimants, like the salt and water in this mishna, has its own independent Shabbat limits, which do not become nullified when mixed with items that have a different Shabbat limit.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> Rav Safra: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are you comparing </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> involving <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibitions, </span>i.e., ritual law, <span class="gemarra-regular">to monetary </span>law? An object subject to <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition, </span>such as a prohibited food, <span class="gemarra-regular">can be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nullified, </span>whereas one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">money cannot be nullified. </span>
Therefore, the initial question remains: Why isn’t the small amount of salt and water in the dough, which is subject to the ritual restriction of Shabbat limits, nullified in the rest of the dough, in the manner of nullification of all other ritual prohibitions? <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the reason </span>that the water and salt are not nullified in the dough? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>that the Sages made, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">make dough in partnership </span>with her neighbors. Indeed, in the case of the mishna, the small amount she received from her neighbor should be nullified in the dough. However, on another occasion, several friends or neighbors might decide to pool ingredients and prepare bread in partnership, in which case the bread is certainly bound by the Shabbat limits of all the parties combined. In order to prevent confusion between making dough in partnership and making it with borrowed ingredients, the Sages made a decree that the dough in both cases be subject to the same limitations.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">Spices are made</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>add <span class="gemarra-regular">tast</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to food, and <span class="gemarra-regular">taste</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not nullified, </span>even if the amount of actual substance is minute. Nullification indicates that a small amount of food may be considered insignificant and therefore null and void, but if an ingredient is added with the specific intent that its taste be noticed, there can be no nullification. 

Daf 39a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ashi said </span>a different explanation as to why the spices, water, and salt are not subject to nullification: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>any one of these ingredients <span class="gemarra-regular">is an object whose prohibition is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">temporary, </span>as the prohibition against their being taken out of the Shabbat limits lapses once the Festival has passed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the general principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything whose prohibition is temporar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot become nullified, even </span>by one part <span class="gemarra-regular">in one thousand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ It is taught in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda exempts </span>one from travel limitations <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water. </span>The Gemara asks: Does this mean to imply that <span class="gemarra-regular">water, yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is exempted by Rabbi Yehuda, but <span class="gemarra-regular">salt, no, </span>it is not? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Water and salt are </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified, whether in a dough </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or in a pot </span>of cooked food. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of the mishna, the reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">salt of Sodom, </span>which is quite coarse and does not blend in easily with the dough, and, being noticeable in the final product, is not nullified. In <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the reference is <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> a type of fine salt known as <span class="gemarra-italic">isterokani</span><span class="gemarra-italic">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">salt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, it is not noticeable in the final product and can be nullified.
The mishna states that according to Rabbi Yehuda water mixed into dough, and presumably into a cooked dish as well, is considered nullified. The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: Water and salt are nullified in dough but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not in a pot, due to its sauce. </span>The pot, unlike bread, ends up with liquid in it, so the borrowed water is still recognizable. The Gemara replies: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>case of the mishna, where Rabbi Yehuda says that the water is nullified in the cooked food, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a thick </span>dish that has no liquid sauce. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which Rabbi Yehuda said the water is not nullified, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thin </span>dish with liquid sauce. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coal </span>that one borrowed from another on the Festival is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of the owner, </span>and it may be carried on the Festival to any place where its owner may walk. Since it has substance, it is associated with its owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But a flame </span>that one lit from another’s flame may be taken <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it has no substance. This essential difference between a coal and a flame has additional halakhic ramifications: If one uses <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coal of consecrated property </span>for a non-consecrated purpose, he is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property, since it has substance. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one uses a consecrated <span class="gemarra-regular">flame, </span>although according to rabbinic law <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>from it <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, if one did benefit from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse, </span>since it does not have substance. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes out a coal </span>from a private domain <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public domain </span>on Shabbat is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for the prohibited labor of carrying, but one who takes out <span class="gemarra-regular">a flame is exempt.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Beitza</span> 4:7): <span class="gemarra-regular">Five things were stated with regard to a coal, </span>in relation to the practical halakhic differences between a coal and a flame: <span class="gemarra-regular">(1) Coal is as the feet of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the owner </span>with regard to its Festival resting place, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas a flame </span>may be carried <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere. (2) One </span>is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misusing </span>property consecrated to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">with a consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coal, whereas </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flame</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> according to rabbinic law <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not benefit </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misusing </span>property consecrated to the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">(3) Coal </span>used for <span class="gemarra-regular">idol </span><span class="gemarra-regular">worshi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for one to benefit from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a flame </span>of this sort it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to benefit. <span class="gemarra-regular">(4) One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who carries out a coal to the public domain is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable, whereas </span>one who carries out <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. (5) One who is prohibited by a vow </span>from deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from another is prohibited from </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">his coal, but</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flame</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> cited in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>in in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a flame </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship, that </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to use it even <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> uses the term permitted in that case; <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different </span>in the case of a <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>flame, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to be used <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: One may not benefit from it, but he is not liable for misuse? The Gemara explains: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship, which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is repulsive </span>to Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">and from which </span>Jewish <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span>inherently <span class="gemarra-regular">maintain separation, the Sages did not decree </span>additional restrictions <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to it. </span>However, concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated property, which is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> repulsive and from which people do not </span>inherently <span class="gemarra-regular">maintain separation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in order to prevent its misuse, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decree with regard to it </span>that it is prohibited to use the flame.
§ It is taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who carries out a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coal to the public domain </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable, whereas </span>one who carries out <span class="gemarra-regular">a flame is exempt. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carries out a flame of any size </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable? Rav Sheshet said: </span>The second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one carried out </span>the flame along <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a wooden chip. </span>Since the flame is attached to a physical object, it is considered significant.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it derive </span>that one is liable for carrying out in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wooden chip, </span>and the presence of the flame is irrelevant. The Gemara responds: That <span class="it-text">baraita</span> speaks of a chip <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have the </span>minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>that determines liability for carrying out, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 89b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who carries out wood </span>on Shabbat, the measure that determines liability is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">to cook an egg </span>of the kind that is the <span class="gemarra-regular">easiest </span>to cook, which is the egg of a chicken. Because the chip is too small to cook an egg, one is not liable for carrying it out, but one is liable for carrying out the flame attached to it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>a different scenario: The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one smeared a vessel with oil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and lit a fire on it, </span>and carried out that flame. The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it derive</span> that one is liable for carrying out in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel </span>itself, and the flame is irrelevant. The Gemara replies: The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a fire lit in <span class="gemarra-regular">an earthenware </span>shard, not in a whole vessel. 
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it derive </span>that one is liable for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">earthenware </span>shard itself. The Gemara answers: It deals <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a shard <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not of </span>the minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>that determines liability for carrying out, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 82a): The measure that determines liability for carrying out <span class="gemarra-regular">earthenware </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">between one </span>window <span class="gemarra-regular">frame and another, </span>as small shards of earthenware were sometimes placed between window frames during construction. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, if one is liable for carrying it out whenever the flame is attached to an object of substance, <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we learned </span>in the mishna here: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who carries out a flame is exempt, </span>under <span class="gemarra-regular">what circumstances </span>can this case <span class="gemarra-regular">be found? </span>The Gemara answers: The mishna is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fanned </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">with his hand </span>so that it spread <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public domain </span>without its being attached to any vessel.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern of an individual, </span>water drawn from it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of the individual </span>who owns the cistern, and the water may be carried only to those places where its owner is permitted to walk. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>water drawn from a cistern belonging jointly to all <span class="gemarra-regular">the people </span>dwelling in <span class="gemarra-regular">a particular town is as the feet of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people of that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">town</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>water drawn from a cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">of those who come up </span>to Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonia, </span>i.e., a public cistern, is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of whoever fills </span>his vessel with its water; the water has no defined boundary of its own since it is made available to all. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised a contradiction to Rav Naḥman: We learned</span> in the mishna that the water of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an individual is as the feet of the individual; and</span> Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a contradiction </span>from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Beitza</span> 4:8): Water drawn from <span class="gemarra-regular">flowing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">river</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and flowing springs are as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the feet of all people. Rava said: With what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing here </span>in the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span>cisterns that contain <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span>water, not flowing water. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The mishna applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">to collected </span>water. 
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>water drawn from a cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">of those who come up </span>to Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">from Babylonia, </span>i.e., a public cistern, is <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the feet of whoever fills </span>his vessel with its water. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to this issue: In the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">filled </span>a vessel with water from a public cistern on behalf of <span class="gemarra-regular">another and gave </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The water is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for whom they were filled; Rav Sheshet said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of the one who filled </span>it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage, </span>Rav Sheshet, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that a public <span class="gemarra-regular">cistern is ownerless, </span>and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that one cannot take possession of ownerless property on behalf of someone else. Therefore, the water belongs to the one who drew it; it is as his feet, and this status does not change even if he subsequently gave it to anyone else. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that a public cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered jointly owned <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>all its <span class="gemarra-regular">partners, </span>namely, all of the Jewish people. Therefore, it is possible for one partner to draw water on behalf of another partner, and the drawn water immediately belongs to the person for whom it was drawn. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised a challenge to Rav Naḥman </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 47b): One who says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>by force of <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥerem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a kind of vow of prohibition, as objects declared as <span class="it-text">ḥerem</span> are generally consecrated to the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one prohibited by the vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the addressee, <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to derive benefit from the person who made the vow or from his property, as the point of the vow was to prohibit the addressee from deriving any benefit from the one who made the vow. 

Daf 39b

If he said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are hereby </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>by force of <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥerem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one making the vow is </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to derive benefit from the addressee or from his property. If he said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">you to me </span>by force of <span class="it-text">ḥerem</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>to benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from one another. And they are permitted</span> to benefit from anything belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to those who come up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Babylonia, </span>i.e., public property that is not owned by any person or group, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they are prohibited </span>to benefit from property that is jointly owned by the inhabitants <span class="gemarra-regular">of that city, </span>as both parties have a share in such items. 
That mishna provides examples: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the following are items of those coming up from Babylonia,</span> i.e., publicly owned items: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Temple Mount, the chambers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the courtyards </span>on the Temple Mount, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cistern </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle of the road. And these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>items jointly owned by the inhabitants <span class="gemarra-regular">of that city: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The street, and the synagogue</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the bathhouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rava, having cited the mishna in full, concludes his challenge to the opinion of Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern </span>of those who come up from Babylonia, a public cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>owned jointly <span class="gemarra-regular">by partners, </span>i.e., by all Jews, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>should it be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for the one who made the vow and the addressee to use it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 45b): Two <span class="gemarra-regular">partners who took a vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> not to derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from one another are prohibited to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>a joint <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>in which they both have a share. According to you, the same should apply to a cistern in which the two of them have a share, such as the cisterns of those who come up from Babylonia. 
Rav Naḥman answered: Indeed that is the case. <span class="gemarra-regular">So </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>they are prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to wash </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">in a cistern</span> because when bathing one uses of all the water of the cistern, part of which belongs to the forbidden partner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> says that a cistern of those who come up from Babylonia is permitted to both parties, <span class="gemarra-regular">with what are we dealing here? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring only <span class="gemarra-regular">to filling </span>water from the cistern. This is permitted because it is considered that <span class="gemarra-regular">this one fills </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from his </span>portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one fills from his </span>portion. The water that each of them draws is considered retroactively designated exclusively for him, so that the partner has no share in it at all.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Rav Naḥman hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shekalim</span> 1:7): If <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span>divided up inherited property among themselves and subsequently joined their property again and became <span class="gemarra-regular">partners, they are obligated to </span>add <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kalbon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a small coin, to the obligatory half-shekel yearly Temple donation. The <span class="it-text">kalbon</span> covered both the cost to the Temple of exchanging half-shekels into larger coins and the depreciation of the donated coin. Although a whole shekel given by two partners does not need to be changed into a larger coin, the Sages imposed the same <span class="it-text">kalbon</span> fee on the partners as on everyone else. However, these partners <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in accordance with the standard <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that people who own animals in partnership are exempt from the animal tithe. 
The quote from the mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in a situation in which the brothers are <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> animal tithe, </span>as when they have not yet divided up their inheritance, and all the deceased’s estate is therefore still considered a single unit and not a partnership, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are exempt from the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kalbon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a father who contributes a single shekel for his two dependent sons does not need to add the <span class="it-text">kalbon</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Anan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that the inherited property is no longer considered a single unit after the brothers divided it and then rejoined in a partnership <span class="gemarra-regular">only when they divided </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kids against lambs or lambs against kids, </span>i.e., if one brother took kids and the other took a corresponding value of lambs. This kind of division is considered a commercial transaction, with one brother purchasing goats and paying for them with lambs and vice versa. Therefore, when they join their animals again as partners, it is considered an entirely new partnership. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divided kids against kids and lambs against lambs, </span>meaning that each brother took an equal portion of each of the items they inherited, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>of each brother’s portion: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is his portion </span>destined to <span class="gemarra-regular">reach him from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the first moment, </span>from the time of the death of the deceased. If the brothers form their partnership again, the inheritance becomes a single unit again, and they are therefore obligated in the animal tithe and exempt from the <span class="it-text">kalbon</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman said: Even if they divided kids against kids and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lambs against lambs, </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his portion </span>destined to <span class="gemarra-regular">reach him from the first moment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This is because Rav Naḥman does not accept the principle of retroactive designation. Consequently, the resolution proposed previously for the issue of filling water from the cistern of those who come up from Babylonia is invalid.
The Gemara retracts its previous explanation of the disagreement between Rava and Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that a cistern of those who come up from Babylonia, i.e., a public cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">is an ownerless </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cistern, but here they disagree over </span>a different issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who picks up a found article </span>intending to acquire it <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of his friend</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that if one picks up a found object on behalf of his friend, his friend <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> it through this act as though he had picked it up himself. The water of the ownerless cistern is like a found object. Therefore, if one draws water on behalf of another, the latter acquires it, and consequently the water is as his feet. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav Sheshet, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that when one picks up a found object for another, the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not acquire it. </span>Rather, it belongs to the one who actually picked it up, and consequently the water is as the feet of the one who draws it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to<span class="gemarra-regular">one who had produce in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a different city</span> beyond the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of that city </span>where the produce was located joined the Shabbat boundaries, enabling them to reach the owner’s home on the Festival,and they wish <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring him some of his produce, they may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. </span>His produce is as his feet; since it is outside of his Shabbat limit, it may not be taken from its place. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">placed an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> to enable travel to that city, the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">his produce is like his </span>status with regard to the Shabbat limit. People from that city who also placed an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may bring the produce to him, since he himself may walk to the produce and take it. 

Daf 40a

With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who invited guests to</span> visit <span class="gemarra-regular">hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> from a town beyond his Shabbat limit, and they joined the Shabbat boundaries to enable them to reach his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may not carry in their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hands </span>back to their town any <span class="gemarra-regular">portions </span>they received from him as gifts. These portions are as the feet of the host, since they belonged to him on the eve of the Festival. This is true <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he transferred ownership </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of their portions to them on the eve of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival, </span>in which case the gifts may be carried wherever the recipients may walk.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who deposits produce with another </span>for safekeeping: In whose possession is the produce with regard to determining its place of rest over the Festival? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of the one with whom they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deposited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">as the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> feet of the </span>object’s <span class="gemarra-regular">owner. </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel follow their </span>usual line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">brought in </span>his produce or his ox to another’s courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">permission, the owner of the courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>for any damage caused to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">is never liable </span>for damages, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless the homeowner </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">accepts upon himself </span>the responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">watch </span>them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with the statement of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, </span>who disagreed with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav spoke </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, </span>with the following reasoning: Just as when one gives permission to store something in his yard, that object is under his jurisdiction concerning monetary responsibility, so too, it is in his jurisdiction concerning the establishment of the Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel spoke </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: When a homeowner gives permission to store something in his yard, the object is not in his jurisdiction, whether with regard to monetary responsibility or with regard to the Shabbat limit.
The Gemara rejects the comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I said </span>my statement in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. For <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>that an object brought into a courtyard is not considered in the possession of the homeowner with regard to monetary responsibility, <span class="gemarra-regular">because in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinary </span>situation one who allows someone to bring items into his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accept upon himself </span>the responsibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">watching </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">has accepted upon himself </span>the responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">watching </span>the produce, and consequently it is as his feet. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I said </span>my statement here <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis stated </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>maintaining that the objects are considered in the jurisdiction of the homeowner, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is a person’s, </span>i.e., the owner’s, <span class="gemarra-regular">preference that his ox </span>or other object <span class="gemarra-regular">be established in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the jurisdiction of the owner of the courtyard, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>his ox <span class="gemarra-regular">does damage </span>to the homeowner’s property the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be liable. But here, is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a person’s preference for his produce to be in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another’s jurisdiction </span>with regard to the establishment of its Shabbat limit? It is certainly inconvenient for him to have his produce out of his Shabbat limit. Consequently, the two disputes between Rav and Shmuel are not necessarily connected. 
The Gemara asks concerning Rav’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">placed an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">his produce is like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>status. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that deposited produce is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of the one with whom they were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deposited, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the owner of the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">placed an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what of it? </span>The produce is under the jurisdiction of the people in the other town with whom it was deposited. It should be as their feet, not as the feet of the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Sages of the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rav said </span>in reply to this question: The mishna is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the keeper <span class="gemarra-regular">designated a corner </span>of his house <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> the owner, thereby revealing his intention that the produce not be considered in his own jurisdiction but rather in that of the owner. Consequently, it remains as the feet of the owner. 
The Gemara raises another challenge to Rav’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a different proof from the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who invited guests to </span>visit <span class="gemarra-regular">him, they may not carry in their hands </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">portions </span>they may have received back to their town, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he transferred ownership of their portions to them on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve of the Festival. And if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that deposited items are <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one with whom they were deposited, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> transferred ownership to them by means of another </span>person taking possession on their behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">what of it? </span>The portions are in any event deposited in the house of the host, and they should be as his feet. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, since he transferred ownership to them by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">means of another </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered as </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who designated a corner for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that the gifts are considered in the jurisdiction of the guests and may be carried wherever they may walk. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the entire case of <span class="gemarra-regular">transferring ownership is different </span>because the host’s specific intention is to transfer possession of the portions entirely to his guests. This means that the guests have certainly established the place of rest of these portions in their own jurisdiction and that the portions are as their feet.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ḥanila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> once <span class="gemarra-regular">hung meat on the bar of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the door </span>of his host’s house, located outside his own town. He subsequently wondered if he was permitted to take the meat home with him, since he had made an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> enabling him to walk from his home to his host’s home. <span class="gemarra-regular">He came before Rav Hun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> to ask his opinion. Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If you</span> yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">hung </span>the meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">go take it, but if </span>your hosts <span class="gemarra-regular">hung </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for you, you may not take it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">hung </span>the meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">may he </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t Rav Huna </span>a student of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, and Rav said</span> that when an object is deposited in one’s house it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the feet of the one with whom it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was deposited, </span>which in this case is the host. The Gemara responds: Here <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different, </span>as Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai hung the meat on <span class="gemarra-regular">the bar of the </span>host’s <span class="gemarra-regular">door, </span>and this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered similar to </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who designated a corner for him. </span>Since he was given a particular spot for the meat, it is considered his in all respects. 
The Gemara raises a further objection with regard to this incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hillel said to Rav Ashi: And if they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hung </span>the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, may he </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Shmuel say: An ox of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fattener, </span>who fattens oxen in order to sell them for meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">is as the feet of all people, </span>i.e., it is as the feet of whoever buys it on the Festival. This shows that meat that is likely to be sold is not as the feet of its owner, but rather it follows the buyer, as the intention before the Festival is that it be for whoever happens to purchase it. Here too, the intention from the outset was that Rav Ḥana would take it over the course of the Festival. 
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi: And if </span>the hosts <span class="gemarra-regular">hung </span>the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, may he </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar bar Ḥana say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that in a town that has only one shepherd, an animal that will be given to that shepherd over the course of the Festival is as the feet of the shepherd, since it is certain that the animal will be transferred to him. Here too, since the meat was put aside for Rav Ḥana, he should be permitted to take it with him. There is a further difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Rav Kahana: And if they hung </span>the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, may he </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: The status of <span class="gemarra-regular">animals and vessels is as the feet of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The same should apply to meat that was hung for him; it should be as his feet. 
Because of all these questions, the Gemara reinterprets the case of Rav Ḥana. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the problem with the meat concerns a completely different matter, as the issue under consideration is not the establishment of its place of rest but the prohibition against eating meat that has been left unobserved, due to the concern that it might have been exchanged for prohibited meat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥana bar Ḥanilai is different </span>from the average person, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he is a great man and occupied with his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> studies, and this is what </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If you </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">hung </span>it, in which case <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>noticed some recognizable <span class="gemarra-regular">mark on </span>the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">and your attention was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not diverted from it, </span>the meat is not forbidden for having been left unobserved, and therefore you <span class="gemarra-regular">may go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>the hosts <span class="gemarra-regular">hung </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you, you </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">diverted your attention </span>from it, and they too did not pay careful attention to it after hanging it on your behalf. In that case, it is considered meat that has been left unobserved, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you may </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>it. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">ne may not water or slaughter desert </span>animals, which graze mainly outside the town, as they are considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, one may water and slaughter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domesti</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span> animals. The mishna elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">domestic </span>animals: Those <span class="gemarra-regular">that sleep in the city </span>at night. <span class="gemarra-regular">Desert </span>animals are those <span class="gemarra-regular">that sleep in the pasture </span>and come into town only rarely. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: The mishna is coming to teach which animals are <span class="it-text">muktze</span> and consequently may not be slaughtered and eaten on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">do I </span>need the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: One may water and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> What does watering have to do with the topic at hand? The Gemara explains: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>a practical <span class="gemarra-regular">matter incidentally: That a person should </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">water his animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward slaughter </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the adhesion </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">skin </span>to the meat when this is not done. If one first waters the animal, it is easier to skin it after slaughtering it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which are desert </span>animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">and which are domestic ones? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Desert </span>animals include <span class="gemarra-regular">all those that go out </span>to pasture <span class="gemarra-regular">at Passover </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">and graze in the meadows </span>day and night <span class="gemarra-regular">and enter </span>the town again only <span class="gemarra-regular">at the first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rainfall, </span>at the start of the rainy season. <span class="gemarra-regular">And these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are domestic </span>animals: <span class="gemarra-regular">All that go out </span>in the morning <span class="gemarra-regular">and graze outside the </span>town’s <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary but come and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sleep within the boundary </span>at night. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Both these and those are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">domestic </span>animals and may be slaughtered on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, these are desert animals </span>that may not be slaughtered on the Festival: <span class="gemarra-regular">All those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that go out and graze in the meadows and do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not enter the settled area, neither in the summer nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the rainy season.</span>
The Gemara asks concerning Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi in general <span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>the concept of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But didn’t Rabbi Shimon, son </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">inquire of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Unripe dates</span> that are placed in a basket <span class="gemarra-regular">to ripen </span>until they are edible, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Shimon</span> ben Yoḥai? Are they considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span> or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no </span>recognition of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to Rabbi Shimon, </span>

Daf 40b

<span class="gemarra-regular">except</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dried figs and raisins </span>in the midst of the drying process <span class="gemarra-regular">alone. These </span>are fruits that are fit to be eaten fresh and were deliberately removed from use to allow them to undergo a drying process, during which time they are inedible; they have therefore been actively removed from one’s mind for the interim. Unripe dates, however, are unfit to be eaten fresh and become fit for eating only when they are ripe. Therefore, if one places unripe dates in a basket to ripen, they are never completely removed from his mind, not having been changed from an edible state to an inedible state, and are permitted. If so, desert animals, which are similarly never completely removed from one’s mind, should also not be considered <span class="it-text">muktze</span>. Why, then, does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi indicate that they have the status of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>? 
The Gemara suggests several resolutions: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>desert animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are also considered similar to dried fig</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and raisins, </span>as by sending them outside the town the owner has actively removed them from use. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you wish, say </span>instead that the fact that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi told his son that Rabbi Shimon does not accept the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="it-text">muktze</span> except for the case of dried figs and raisins does not prove anything about his own opinion; <span class="gemarra-regular">he stated </span>this only <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he himself does not hold accordingly</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>a different answer: He himself, like Rabbi Shimon, did not accept the concept of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, and when he spoke in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he was speaking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for the sake of argument, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">words </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who had spoken before him, saying to them, in effect: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to my </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">muktze</span> at all, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, and all animals may be slaughtered on the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">according to your approach</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that there is a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="it-text">muktze</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">agree with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me, in any event, </span>that with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they go out and graze on Passover and enter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">again at the first rainfall, they are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">domestic animals </span>and should be permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>even those <span class="gemarra-regular">are desert animals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
